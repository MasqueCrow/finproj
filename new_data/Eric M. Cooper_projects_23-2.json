Destroyed not by famine, disease or pollution as most scientists predicted but by a world killing, universe destroying empire of parasitic creatures known as the Eukarya. \n\nWith no home, the remaining human populace has fled to the stars and created a vast and powerful space colony called Libor (LEEBOR). \n\nIn an attempt to stop this parasitic evil from spreading across the cosmos, the humans created a resistance effort in the form of a fleet of high powered star fighters. Young pilots man these incredibly powerful space jets to protect the universe at all costs.\n\nJoystick Angels is a story for the ages and new breed of Independent comic! Grab the first heart pounding issue of Joystick Angels and here today! \n\nFox - \nFOX\nDamien Fox aka FOX - He is the brash and cocky 16 year old leader of the Angels fighter pilot team. At the age of five Fox\u2019s parents were killed in the first galactic war against the Eukarya Empire. Raised by the officials at Libor, Fox made it his life's mission to become a space pilot like his parents before him and fight the evil of the Eukarya. Fox has a serious chip on his shoulder which eventually gets him into trouble but his keen eye and almost prodigy-like understanding of space jets makes him a major asset to the movement.\nFox's space jet\nDeuce -  \nDEUCE\nLexi Winbush aka DEUCE - Is a 16yr old animal humanoid hybrid creature which they call The Naku. She along with many of her kind spent most of her life in a lab and was created for the sole purpose of assisting Libor space squadrons in extra-planetary exploration by testing out living conditions. This is something that she is not happy with which has caused many issues in her life. The only person that really accepted her for as she was and treated her like a person was Fox. When Fox formed the Angels team she joined as his second in command. Her animalistic side also makes very formidable in battle.\nDeuce's space jet\n Dragonetti - \nDRAGONETTI\nAndrew Marx aka DRAGONETTI - He is a flamboyant 16 year old black kid who is a lover of music and dance as well as all 80-90\u2019s. He also happens to be the fastest fighter pilot in all of Libor. Just like Fox, Dragonetti\u2019s parents were killed in the first galactic war against the Eukarya. Growing up on the Libor Space Station Dragonetti stayed getting into trouble and eventually met Fox and was swayed by his passion and devotion towards retribution. He eventually joined him and partnered with Fox to create the Joystick Angels team where he serves as Battle officer and strategist.\nDragonetti's space jet\nLegz -  \nLEGZ\nAisha Garcia aka LEGZ - Is a 14 year old AfroLatina Queer girl who serves the Angels team as lead engineer and tech wiz kid. Legz spends most of her time building robotic sentries, writing AI code and servicing the Angels ships in preparation for battle or space flight. She also has a very hot temper which gets her into trouble. So much trouble that she met Fox in a stockade after they both got caught stealing. From that point on they formed a bond and eventually years later when Fox formed the Angels she joined her friend as one of his right hands.\nLegz space jet\nTank - \nTANK\nCassandra Middleton aka TANK - She is a strong and snappy young 15 year old black girl who doubles as espionage agent for the Libor government as well as a member of the Angels team. Besides being one of the best pilots in the galaxy she also is assigned to interplanetary travel and intel collection. She serves the Angels as lead strategist and data analyst. Tank only grew up with her mother as her father died in the first galactic war against the Eukarya. Her love of life is only eclipsed by her love for all things fashion and retro. She is assigned to join the Angels and provide multi level support.\nTanks space jet\nFor a 1 week only take advantage of the Joystick Angels Memorial Day Tier! \nGet a FREE 6x10 art print, an early copy of Okemus #5 and a early copy of the next Mitt Music album Rapping Diva for only $20! \nSPECIAL MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND TIER & ADD ON\nRAE Comics was created for the sole purpose of publishing unique stories about under-represented characters as well as to create innovative, cool and completely different narratives about Black, POC and Diverse heroes.\nTj Sterling - Founder, Co-creator and Writer Joystick Angels\nTJ Sterling is the owner/operator of RAE Comics.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In a Journey toward creative expression, I found myself, and a story rich with characters, environments, and extraordinary potential.\nPLAY\n\nWHY YOU?\nbecause you're you, and you're special, and if you're here, you know it's time that we claim our inner power and unleash our full potential to save humanity.\nbecause you support independent artists that are passionate and creating dope things.\nbecause you know heritage and diversity are extremely important and have been for a long time. You think that literature, comics, and animation are the perfect way to bridge schools of thought, but to do that requires awareness and quality content.\nbecause you believe in the power of intention.\nWHY ME?\nI grew up LOVING books, and after secretly writing books for years, I decided to self-publish the one series that stuck with me. It was formerly Dragon Wars and has grown into the Lost Children of Andromeda as I have grown into myself.\n  Five years ago, (after a long career in marketing), I dedicated the rest of my life to Lost Children of Andromeda and all of the things that could come from it.\n  Enter my first novel, Zosma (published November 2018), and my forthcoming novel, 205Z: Time and Salvation (due out May 2021) - Thanks to you!\nA large part of my mission is to give voice to the underrepresented, and increase diversity and inclusion in book publishing. I am also creating a book club program where we give disadvantaged youth access to diverse novels and comics to inspire affinity for literature as an experience, thus improving literacy. For the number of books sold through Kickstarter, I will match that number of books being donated to disadvantaged youth. \nNOW INTRODUCING:\nTHE LOST CHILDREN OF ANDROMEDA\nBecause I'm passionate about the experience of life, I made Lost Children of Andromeda more than a book series, I made it an immersive experience!! We have art, music, literature, and a fully immersive cinematic podcast and comic book concept in the works. Thanks to an overwhelming amount of love and support, my first book and soundtrack: ZOSMA were already funded. Now I\u2019m here to bring the next experience in the series to life 205Z: Time and Salvation, a Hardcover Novel with images + eBook + Audiobook + a soundtrack.\n205Z Time and Salvation follows Allister Adams --\nAllister Adams - The Containment Center\n-- A young man classified as an \u201cEvolutionary\u201d with inhuman DNA and abilities like strength, regeneration, and energy manipulation, as he searches for his place and his power in a world about to end. Plus a diverse cast of characters like Dr. Florence Belladonna, the high riding political injected to ensure success; Captain Jared Brandt, Evolutionary frontman dedicated to saving humanity; and Lieutenant Leesa Delemar, the strongest living Evolutionary with a terrible secret. \nDr. Florence Belladonna\nCaptain Jared Brandt\nLieutenant Leesa Delemar\nWith only 215 days left until a catastrophic natural event, they\u2019ll go up against the infamous C20 organization in the race for alien artifacts that promise humanity\u2019s salvation. \nC20\nTHE ASK:\n1. With your support today, I can bring a story to life that generations will enjoy for years to come. What your support goes toward is the images in the novel, an animated book trailer for marketing, editing costs, formatting, the audiobook recording, the soundtrack, and the final book cover files. \n2. I'm self-published, so I can't get this novel onto your bookshelf, in your headphones, or to fellow sci-fi fantasy/speculative fiction fans without your support. Word of mouth is essential in an ecosystem that doesn\u2019t trust advertising, and in some cases, media. Trust each other, trust yourselves. Follow your intuition.\n\nTHE BACKGROUND:\nAlas, the journey continues. Lost Children of Andromeda has become more than I could have ever imagined. It is a beacon for myself, what I continue to pour myself into, and every day I feel myself UNLEASHING more and more of my potential. I am compelled by some power and heritage within, something flowing through me to persevere, to keep going in spite of the obstacles. During 2019 and 2020, a difficult time in all of our lives, where we faced more pain and more loss than ever, I still knew, even as the storm raged around us \u2014 We have always been strong enough. It\u2019s from this place that I wrote the novel.\nThis creative process has been a joyful reflection of my inner journey, and constantly reminds me of the blessings that come with building this platform --  deeply connecting with other creators, book lovers, storytellers, and incredible Evolutionaries.\nThe community is growing and I want you to be a part of it. \nHERE'S WHAT YOU GET\n205Z: Time and Salvation hardcover copy you get by supporting this campaign will never be available again. It will have all of the images and a special hardcover. The great news is, you\u2019re early. Supporting today means you\u2019ll be among the first (calling all early adopters!) You\u2019ll also get the novel before it\u2019s even available to the public.\nThe rewards are extra special and closely linked to the world. (All designs by the incredible Kieron Anthony Lewis.

With a new campaign full of exclusive content, covers, posters and t-shirts, we are here to set the bar high and Keep it Konkret!!!\n \n Each Konkret title will appeal to different readers. Having diversity and great storytelling as our biggest priorities, we have focused on writing and producing the highest quality comics in the market right now. If you are a fan of super hero adventures mixed with cosmic science fiction, you will fall in love with Akolyte. Odina is a must-read title for fans of X-Men, ancient Egyptian mythology and Black culture. Enthusiasts of the supernatural, horror and crime stories will be attracted to Absolver\u2019s dark storytelling. Those who like complex world building, Hollywood-level action and sci-fi franchises like District 9 and Ben 10 will become die-hard fans of Andy Starboy.\nBeing a group of multi-cultured artists, creators and writers, Konkret Comics is here to show our diverse culture under a positive light and build a platform for voices of color to be heard, creating characters and stories for the old and new generations of readers to feel represented by.\n Akolyte #2: A few years after learning about his cosmic powers, Akolyte returns to Earth as its greatest hero. However, his mere presence has awakened many enemies, ranging from the criminal underground, the government, and a mysterious menace from outer space! The time has come for Akolyte to show the world who he truly is. Will the hero of Sapphire City fold under pressure, or will he rise to the occasion as the world's brightest light?\n  Akolyte #2 Legacy\n Odina #2: Odina, a superheroine who abandoned the world of crime-fighting, finds herself back in action in the midst of a battle between Gods and super human Hybrids. Odina must track down a demi-goddess on the loose and stop her before she finds a group of mystical items that will unleash hell on Earth.\n  Odina #2 \" Omni Strike\"\n Absolver #2: Absolver has only one purpose: Hunting for those who need vindication. However, his commitment to his mission is put to the test when he ends up questioning the lack of acknowledgment for his efforts. Does the Hunter need acceptance? Meanwhile, we find out that you don\u2019t get to return to the living and hunt them down without putting a target on your back!\n  Absolver #2 \" Before I Wake\"\n Andy Starboy #1: Andy Starboy is the greatest hero of a world where Roswell, New Mexico has been the crashing site of several alien ships, advancing technology immensely and creating a new race of mutants who are constantly discriminated against.

Starting at home with his parents, who encouraged his imagination to flourish, he was also able to look at iconic Philly personalities for encouragement. As a creator and CEO of Konkret Comics, he has always thought that good storytelling never goes out of style. With Akolyte, he hopes to inspire any little girl or boy that dreams of doing something extraordinary. In 2020, Akolyte Issue 1 was nominated to 5 Glyph Awards, including best writer and best male character.\n Onaji Rouse- Creator/Writer (Odina)\n  Onaji Rouse\nHailing from the Mecca of African-American entertainment, Atlanta, GA, Onaji has always wanted to create worlds and stories for his people. He credits both Stan Lee and Dwayne McDuffie for paving the way for him. Jim Lee\u2019s iconic run on X-Men also had a heavy influence on his style and desire to write comics. Odina embodies the strength in all of us and the willingness to work through the difficult times in our past in order to make a difference in the future. In 2020, he was nominated for 2 Glyph Awards for best writer and rising star, due to his work on Odina issue 1.\nJermael Lessey- Creator/Writer (Absolver)\nJermael Lessey\nJermael was able to cultivate multiple sources of inspiration, having been born in Trinidad and Tobago and raised in both New York and Florida. Christopher Reeve\u2019s Superman and 1989\u2019s Batman film ignited the fire within him, but Spawn set it ablaze. Through Absolver, Jermael wants to create a space where African-Americans can experience a mythos that represents them. Taking inspiration from real-life events, the comic acts as a reflection of the Black experience in America, dealing with themes like corruption, violence and pain.\n\n Daniel D.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We've reached out third stretch goal of $27,000!!! Thank you Monster Fans!! That means everyone who has backed at a physical reward tier will get a bonus comic book added to their reward tier. I'm excited to be able to add an additional book for readers to hold in their hands and dig into the Crescent City Monsters world.\nCrescent City Monsters starts in 1963 with Jonas Atelus, a sorcerer who is deeply seated in the New Orleans supernatural world. Unknown to Jonas, a mysterious being puts a bounty on his head. Jonas is also an aspiring blues musician and on the night of his band's first paying gig, the monsters of Crescent City attack Jonas to collect the bounty. \nPOST CHAPTER ONE SPOILERS: \nThe events of that night change Jonas's life dramatically. He loses his powers and wakes up decades later in a new body and his memory fades in and out. With the unwittingly help of powerful teenage Creole Magic sorcerers, Jonas escapes from the outer-dimensional prison he was trapped in. His escape is just the beginning of this nightmare of a journey he's thrown into. \nAlthough Jonas escapes his outer-dimensional prison, there are other supernatural forces that see his existence as a threat and they plan to eliminate that threat.\nChapter four continues to dig deeper into the dark world of Crescent City Monsters and its characters. The story also explores how Jonas deals with having everything taken away from him while trying to figure out why a bounty was put on is head.\nCheck out more previews pages:\nTHE BOOKS\nWe're half way through completing issue four and part of the Kickstarter funds will be used to pay artist Gian Carlo Bernal to complete issue four.\nThis Kickstarter campaign will also help fund the printing of BOTH the trade and hardcover that collects issues 1-4 AND for individual copies of issue #4! So, if you already have issues 1-3 and want only issue 4, we've got you. \nThe hardcover and trade will be 100+ pages of amazing black and white art and story with quality gloss paper that will make the artwork pop. The plan is to make the hardcover slightly larger than the trade so you can enjoy a closer look at Gian Carlo's amazing artwork.\nCreator's Edition (PDF)\nIncluded in all tiers will also be a bonus Creator's Edition PDF. This PDF will contain the line artwork and script for issue #1.\n$16K:  DayBlack & Crescent City Monsters \nWe're collaborating with Keef Cross, the creator of DayBlack, on a crossover with Crescent City Monsters. The first stretch goal will be a PDF of a 10-12 page crossover comic book drawn by Keef Cross added to every reward tier if we reach $16K. We're excited about this collaboration because of the incredible synergy between DayBlack and Crescent City Monsters. The story will take place before chapter one of Crescent City Monsters circa 1962, so we'll dig more into Crescent City Monster's main character, Jonas, and his life before the bounty was put on his head. For those of you who are new to DayBlack you'll be introduced to the main character, Merce, a former slave who was bitten by a vampire in the cotton fields. Four hundred years later, he works as a tattoo artist in the small town of DayBlack. Check out dayblackcomic.com for more of  Merce's story. \nArtist Gian Carlo Bernal and writer Newton Lilavois recently won the 2020 Glyph Comic Awards for BEST ARTIST, BEST WRITER, BEST COVER, and FAN AWARD FOR BEST WORK for their comic book series Crescent City Monsters.\nWHY DID I CREATE THIS STORY? \nAs a Haitian-American I wanted to introduce the rich Haitian Voodoo lore to comic books readers through more authentic lens. Mix that with my love for dark gritty stories and the urge to create a zombie story, and you have the delicious gumbo called Crescent City Monsters.\nWhat are the fans saying?\n\"Great beginning and refreshing comic that has a great story to tell. The story placement is awesome and gives off a true world experience to the characters also great art as well.\" - Terrance S.\n\"One of the best comic books I have read in years. I purchase 500 plus comics per year, and this one is by far my favorite of 2020. The story has me completely hooked and anxious for more. The art work is phenomenal .\"- James J.\n\"An amazing original tale! I've always been into supernatural comics like Blade, Midnight Sons, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, Man-Thing, and Crescent City Monsters takes it to a sophisticated level!\" - Jesus S.\n\"Absolutely love the story line and the illustrations are definitely amazing! Would love to see the comics in color. Great job overall hope to see more soon. :)\" - Tiesha S.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with every Kickstarter there are risks involved in fulfilling the rewards.

Sterling of RAE Comics, colored by Balram Banerjee, and lettered by Deron Bennett of Andworld Design. This will be a full color, 32-page comic book with some very cool Variant Covers!\nThe purpose of campaign and our mission is to help put this entertaining and unique flagship comic series Okemus into the hands of people all over the world and continue to celebrate positive and uplifting black stories in comics.\nIt is also our prime mission to bring many more of our creative projects to life with the help of the Kickstarter community and more.\nAlternate Cover Wraparound art for OKEMUS issue 4\nOKEMUS is a sci-fi manga sentai-esk action epic about a young man named Cale who unknowingly possesses a latent super-human ability that could potentially save the human race. Enter the Okemus Hunters four villainous bio-mechanical warriors who have traveled from a dark desolate future to our modern day time period to acquire this ability and use for there own evil purposes. \nAs the Hunters get closer to Cale this latent super-human ability begins to AWAKEN. \nUnbeknownst to this young man is the path that awaits him where the key to the salvation of two worlds could solely lean on his shoulders! \nIssue 4 of this 6 part comic series (offered in this Kickstarter) is 32 pages. Also available is Issue 0, 1, 2, 3. Get the whole story so far!\nCale & The Okemus Hunters\nI created OKEMUS for ALL the fans of big budget action, time travel and sci-fi stories. Although OKEMUS is safe and fun for all ages we suggest readers that are 10 and up read this story due to the high powered action and fight scenes. (No different than Dragon Ball Z, Power Rangers and or Xmen).\nSimilar to Dragon Ball Z, Super Sentai and X-men, Okemus plays with various archetypes, themes, concepts of spirituality and non-linear storytelling to craft an epic tale that has very unique characters and situations. \nBut if you dig deeper, all these elements speak to a much deeper meaning...within all of us there is greatness and it's up to us to explore that greatness fully and live our dreams.  \nPage 2 from Okemus Issue #4\nIssue Four of OKEMUS is 100% drawn and inked, and colored. Lettering is taking place as this campaign is running. Here are some samples of the amazing work by CEO and Artist TJ Sterling and colorist Balram Banerjee. \nPage 8 from OKEMUS issue #4\nPage 11 from OKEMUS issue #4\nPage 12 from OKEMUS issue #4\nEarth. 2000 years in the future. 80 percent of the worlds resources have been diminished.  Animal life ceases to exist. Radiation and extreme forces of nature make the surface inhabitable for extended periods of time. War has taken it's toll. To make matters worse the world has become overrun with bio-mechanical monsters called Mechai. The Human race struggles to survive as their numbers dwindle day by day.\nAt one point in History there was a lone warrior who stood against the Mechai and kept them at bay, giving humanity a fighting chance. After the mysterious disappearance of this lone warrior the world was left without a protector. \nThe Okemus Hunters - Mesar, Tisena, Sahta, Bain\nIn an attempt to recreate their missing hero a rogue science division genetically experiments on four military operatives giving them extraordinary abilities. These four warriors would become known as the Okemus Hunters. Their mission is to annihilate the Mechai by traveling through time and stopping them before they even began and finding the source of the genetic anomaly.\nRewind to the year 2015.

If you pledge $25, you're going to get the reward for $25 -- no surprises. \n\nCan damnation turn into redemption? Can revenge turn into salvation? For fans of both horror and intellectual stories with a heart, I present Worms Crawl In. It is a 160-page black & white original graphic novel.\nHomeless spirit medium Delane exists in a jaded world but, when her only friend is murdered, she hits rock bottom. Marco is a ghost trapped in a rotting corpse craving revenge against the same person that killed Delane\u2019s friend. Together, they embark on a quest for blood that metamorphizes into a journey of self-discovery and redemption. They find virtue in freeing souls damned to roam the earth even as a sinister power intends to keep the souls bound forever. \nWhat makes it different? This is NOT a \u201czombie book.\u201d There is NO apocalypse. This is a macabre character driven tale in which one of the main protagonists, Marco, is trapped within a living dead corpse looking for redemption. Borrowing liberally from established myths and paranormal pseudo-science, this supernatural thriller with  heart pits existentialism and the depths of friendship against ghosts and hungry cadavers. It teases modern paranormal culture in its references, such as ghost hunting, demonic possession, Bigfoot, and cannibal murderers.  \nThis book targets a mature audience (17+ for language, violence, gore) who loves The Crow, Swamp Thing, and Redlands. \nI love sequential art story-telling. In middle school, I made stories with my friends on printer paper and tried to sell it at the local comics shop. I flunked a class in high school because I doodled more than I studied.  I went to a University and got a degree in illustration. I've partnered with many talented fellow creators in small press and independent publishing. But, for the past five years I decided to walk this path alone and bring my own story to life.\nI spent the first two years just learning how to write in a structured way, and rewriting version after version until I had a compelling story. The next three years I would draw, and draw, and ink, and hate my work and re-do pages, and continue to draw and ink. Then, teach myself to letter. Draw and ink some more. Repeat, again...  Feeling as if it would never be done. Discouraged. Invigorated. Obsessed.  \nLeonardo da Vinci is attributed with the saying  \"art is never finished, only abandoned.\" So, I humbly abandon this epic 160-page journey of mine to you.\nPreview  \nWhat is this for?\nMy fellow creators know it takes a lot to produce a book. Human effort and time aside, it's bushels of art supplies, website hosting and domains, ISBNs, proofs, print production, packaging and postage, marketing materials, and all the other crud that's not creative but has to happen to get a product out.  \n\nSince the funding goal has been achieved...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks?!

This statue will be full color and in the same pose as the cover. Only 100 will be made. \nA look at the stickers we unlocked at 16K! For all Backers!! \nJune 30th. Parker Reef warm up before pages. \nThe kid\nA Page from Parker 2 (limited pencil edition)\nWith the funds raised for Adventures part 2,we will not only make the best book we can, but  we will also continue our work with Taninasreef.org, a non profit started last year that helps children and families in need. We have used funds so far for toy drives, baby shower gifts and much more. A portion of this Kickstarter will go directly toward the non profit. \nAdventures part 1 started as a book to somehow wrap my head around the loss of my girlfriend Tana and our newborn son, Parker Reef, on March 14, 2018. What it turned into, however, was a book that meant so much to so many. I never really knew what this book would mean to people. I was (and in a lot of ways, still am) so lost after they passed away, I just wanted somehow to keep them alive. \nSince I am a working comic artist, this medium seemed the best way to do it. \nSo what is the book about.\nParker part 1\nPart 1 Cover\nParker from part 1\nThis story is about Parker's dream to see me in this world.  We planned on raising Parker to  follow his dreams and that is exactly what he attempts to do in Part 1.\nIn the book, souls are the rarest of treasures. Parker, a child lost, is the purest and rarest of all. Known as a forever soul, he is most coveted by the evil that exists within his world. Parker,  who  is 14 in the book (the date they passed)  struggles to understand why he and his mother were taken away from all who loved them. In Adventures of Parker Reef part 1, he longs to ask me those questions, and to understand loss and the pain it brings. To even try and get those answers, Parker must set off on a secret adventure, through a treacherous land known as the Nothing. Within the Nothing,  all lost souls and those souls that remain of people who did evil on this world, exist. A coveted \"gift\", Parker will have to navigate his way through these evil lands, in hopes of making it to me.  Armed with only some items his mother has brought him  (after passing) from my studio, he sets off on his quest! I cant tell you more, Ill ruin part 1 if you havent read it! \nNow, Part 2! \nParkers best friend-Gi-Gantic\nNot everyone is happy about Parkers adventure\nThe Soul Guardian relays the news to Parker of actions and consequences\nBecause of the incredible outpouring of support for part 1,we are bringing Parker home!\npencils\nThe world Parker left, is much different than the one he returns to, after the events in part 1.\nThe barriers between the land of forgotten souls, the Nothing and \"Somewhere\" (Parker and Tanas home) are crumbling. Much has been impacted due to what Parker did and now, the evil that pursued him, is after much more than one soul!\nParker and JB, will not have an easy trip back home\nIn part 1, Parker was on his adventure for his own need to have answers...in part 2, he MUST make it back home before those who pursued him, gain entrance into his land, and terrorize those he knows and loves. On his way home, he must come to grips with his own losses he has experienced since beginning his quest, and the fact his actions have set in motion an imbalance in the place he calls home. This is no longer just about him, but about all the people his first adventure impacted.\nExpect more creatures and with more at stake, more of those who have done evil, will be taking notice and pursuing Parkers soul.  Actions have consequences, even in death.  Parker must get home, but getting there, may prove more difficult than crossing over. \n The PARKER REEF statue will be made by the same team that made the popular GI-GANTIC statue pictured below\nFirst stretch goal will be the GI-GANTIC COLORING BOOK!!  \nIf we hit 18K ALL BACKERS will get the 24 page coloring AND activity book! \nSo many talented Artists contributing drawings! \nNate Lovett\nRyan G Browne\nRyan Kincaid\nJason Meents\nChris Uminga\nColoring book cover.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "**A QUICK NOTE**\nWe are not oblivious to the craziness going on in our world right now due to COVID-19. One thing we'll be doing for this campaign is giving out chapters 1 and 2 (digital) of this graphic novel for FREE to all backers NOW to keep you engaged until the FULL graphic novel is complete and shipped to you.\nAlso, at the $50 tier, we're offering a buy one give one option where you get two signed copies of Iyanu - Child of Wonder graphic novel PLUS a bonus comic. You get to keep your copy (plus the bonus comic) and donate/gift the other copy to someone. \nPlease scroll to the Why Is This Important section for more details on this and more. \nLooking For Stretch Goals?\nScroll down towards the end of the page ;)\nIyanu chronicles the journey of a teenage orphan girl with no recollection of her past, who suddenly discovers that she has abilities that rival the ancient deities of her people. It is these abilities that are the key to bringing back the age of wonders and saving a world on the brink of destruction at the hands of The Corrupt \u2014 Cursed Wildlife and Divine Beasts desperate to destroy humanity.\nVolume 1 of the graphic novel (offered in this Kickstarter) is 112 pages.\nFor as long as I can remember, I've loved kids & family fantasy/adventure stories. I grew up watching amazing animated films/TV series and was always blown away by their fantastic storytelling. But three particular stories will always have a special place in my heart: Avatar: The Last Airbender, Brave and The Incredibles.\nThe Iyanu: Child of Wonder Graphic Novel Series follows in the same footsteps as the aforementioned epic stories. It's fun and heartwarming family entertainment that features a young protagonist who embarks on an adventure that is exciting, unpredictable, and full of magic.\nIt is on this very journey that our lovable protagonist (Iyanu) truly discovers herself and learns the real meaning of being a hero. However, there is one distinctive quality this project has, which the previously mentioned projects do not \u2014 the lore of African culture and mythology as told from the point of view of an African writer.\nSYNOPSIS\nIt has been over a thousand years since the age of wonders \u2014 a time where the Divine Ones blessed humanity with spiritual, structural, and technological marvels.\nBut in the blink of an eye, it all vanished, and all that was left were remnants of an ancient, advanced civilization. As humankind forges ahead, culture becomes knowledge, knowledge becomes history, and history becomes mythology. Until Iyanu. A teenage orphan girl with no recollection of her past who suddenly discovers that she has hidden powers that rival the Divine Ones themselves.\nAs Iyanu tries to come to terms with her new abilities, the people of Yorubaland become aware of an ancient evil that has reawakened. And all that's left between them and destruction are the memories locked away in the mind of Iyanu.\nI created Iyanu for everyone and anyone (kids, teenagers, adults, and families) who loves a great fantasy/adventure coming of age story.\nSimilar to Disney/Pixar's Brave and Netflix's The Dragon Prince, Iyanu does not shy away from the use of epic, fantastical elements (magic, mythical beast, angels, etc.) to shape its story and characters. But on a deeper level, these elements are used to illustrate one central truth \u2014 light always overcoming darkness.\nThe series will explore several themes children and adults alike can relate to and be inspired by. Forgiveness, fellowship, community, acceptance will be central to the story. But ultimately, the goal is to have the audience leave with a feeling that there is greatness within each of us, and we must use this greatness to make our world a better place, just like Iyanu.\nIyanu: Child of Wonder showcases the majesty and awe that is ancient West Africa. Costumes, character designs, set pieces, artifacts, humor, etc. all serve to highlight a robust diversity of culture and tradition like never before. Below are some of the key aspects of the world that make it unique. Many of which are actually inspired by Yoruba culture of the medieval era.\nIf there's anything that we've learned about the entertainment industry in the last few years, it's that the demand for content featuring African culture is huge, and yet, grossly under-served, especially as it pertains to young black girls.\nWe hope to change this starting with Iyanu!\nCOMICS & COVID-19\nWe are not oblivious to the craziness going on in our world right now due to COVID-19. While there were many reasons we very seriously considered suspending this Kickstarter campaign, we made the challenging decision to move forward for many other reasons - the three primary reasons being:\n1. Our devotion towards our mission - To create African inspired superhero and fantasy stories for a global audience. Stories that Entertain, Educate, and Inspire!\n2. To offer, in our own tiny way, a sense of normalcy in these very stressful times to our community of readers, fans and supporters. With events shutting down all over, routines being abruptly altered, and with families being cooped up at home; coming together as a community (in any way we can safely do so) is more important than ever. And that's what Kickstarter and projects like these are all about.\n3.  To be honest, being an independent creator/artist can be brutal at times. Especially concerning finances. Ask any creator, and most will tell you that one or two consecutive bad months could mean \"game over\" for their business. At YouNeek Studios, we pay our artists directly from the revenue from book sales. But, we use Kickstarter as a means to raise money to print said books.\nThat being said, we believe some good can come out of this. Which is why we've decided that with this campaign, we'll be giving out chapters 1 and 2 (digital) of this graphic novel for FREE to all backers PLUS a FREE quarantine bundle (digital) of some of our previous comics to EVERY backer as soon as we get funded!\nCOMICS YOU GET AS SOON AS WE GET FUNDED (DIGITAL)\nE.X.O. \u2013 The Legend of Wale Williams Vol 1 (156 pages)\nMalika \u2013 Warrior Queen Vol 1 (144 pages)\nIyanu: Child of Wonder Chp 1 & 2 (60 pages)\nTraining Courses/Tutorials (how to start your own creative business)\n\nNOTE** \nTwo options: 1) We send you the books and you can decide who you want to give them to. 2) We'll donate the second book on your behalf to someone who can't afford to buy it right now.\nNow more than ever, it's important we spread the LOVE. \n\n\nThe book is 90% complete! YouNeek Studios pays the artists directly (using non-Kickstarter funded money) to complete the books BEFORE launching any of our Kickstarters. All the money received from Kickstarter goes towards printing, creating the rewards (t-shirts, toys, etc.), and Kickstarter fees. \nCheck out the chart below for a full breakdown.\n\n\n\n\nIyanu\nIyanu's story begins after she is found wandering in the forest region of Elu, the last walled city in Yorubaland, as a child with her eyes glowing bright blue. Having no recollection of her past, Olori, the last surviving member of the Agoni \u2014 A group of priests who are the \"Carriers of History\" \u2014 takes her on as an apprentice.\nAfter training Iyanu both in the art of combat and the history of Yorubaland for five years, Iyanu does the forbidden and ventures into the inner walls of Elu. A place none of the Agoni are permitted to venture into. After being spotted by guards, Iyanu sprints away to safety. However, the emotional stress of the entire experience causes Iyanu's hidden powers to manifest in the forest. An event that changes everything!\nYorubaland\nYorubaland is the cultural region of the Yoruba people in West Africa.\nElu\nElu is the only walled settlement in all of Yorubaland with walls strong and high enough to keep out The Corrupt. Elu is also home to Iyanu. Who along with Olori, lives in the Forest District.\nThe Oba\nThe Oba is the sitting king of Elu. When an Oba dies, an Aremo (heir) is selected from a pool of heirs by the Elu Mesi.\nElu Mesi - The Council\nThe council acts as advisors to the Oba. They are there to keep his power in check. Behind the scenes, they can wield absolute power if an Oba is weak. The Elu Mesi is made up of seven elders.\nNuro (Basorun)\nNuro is the Chancellor and Basorun (head of the council) of the Elu Mesi. Some say he skipped the selection ritual after the previous Oba passed away, choosing instead to install a puppet king. A devious ploy that would make him the most powerful man in Elu.\nThe Agoni\nThe Agoni are a group of priests who are referred to as the \"Carriers of History.\" For centuries, they played a crucial spiritual role in Elu and made many discoveries by harnessing visions in The Temple of the Forgotten. However, in recent years, they were all but wiped out by order of Basorun in what he claimed was: \"The Agoni Rebellion.\"\nOlori\nOlori is the last of the Agoni. She took Iyanu in as an apprentice after she found her wandering in the forest with no memory. This sage and capable priestess has many secrets - some of which negatively impact Iyanu's destiny.\nThe Eso\nThe Eso are the elite military men and women of Elu. They are the only ones permitted to venture outside the walls. They are lead by the Eso of Esos: Kakanfo.\nThe Corrupt\nAfter the curse a thousand years ago, these animals have become exponentially more aggressive. They now seek to kill humans at all costs.\nRoye Okupe - Writer/Creator/Art Director\nBorn in Lagos, Nigeria, Roye Okupe is an award-winning filmmaker, author, speaker and entrepreneur whose passion for comics and animation led him to found YouNeek Studios in 2012, an avenue that would allow him to pursue his dream of creating a diverse library of superheroes. Under that umbrella, Roye wrote, produced and directed several animated productions including, but not limited to, the award-winning and critically acclaimed Malika \u2013 Warrior Queen Animated Short. These productions have allowed Roye to attain many prestigious recognitions, such as being #5 on Ventures Africa's list of 40 African innovators to watch (2016) as well as being part of NewAfrican Magazines' 100 most influential Africans two years in a row (2016 & 2017).\nWith the superhero genre currently at the height of popularity, Roye has made it a goal to create a connected universe of heroes, with origins from locations that are currently neglected and/or ignored.

Through the many years I have been involved in the cosplay community, I have been blessed with the opportunity to be part of some amazing projects such as Men vs. Cosplay Calendar, Rescuemen USA  and being on the COVER of NOVA #1 from Marvel Comics. For years, many people have often asked why have I not done my own calendar yet . Well the wait is over\u2026 I am here to announce that I am finally doing my own 2020 calendar!!! In order for this to happen I will need your help\u2026FUNDING! All the monies raised here will go into designing, printing and shipping the calendar out to you later this year. I have been working hard with various photographers and stylists on new photos you have never seen me do before. It\u2019s been exciting and creative! I think you are going to truly love my new work! ,the photos are done and being edited as we speak. I have tried to keep costs down so I could make this affordable for everyone. I am offering a digital version of the calendar , a physical hard copy and We have several tiers for the calendar which will include one or all of the postcard sets which are very special pictures not included in the calendar. These include the cosplay set (some really cool things), Desiree Dear set (My drag persona, corseted up and in some sexy heels for you!), and Cap got nudes set (this one speaks for itself). You won\u2019t find these pictures anywhere else.They are all new just for you! We have thirty days to get to our goal. If we meet the goal before thirty days I do have a secret reward in mind for the calendar.Thank you for considering this and I hope to be sending you one of these rewards soon.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe photos are done and being edited as we speak , for me I believe that was the hard part.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "3 on 3", "descp": "You get to pick one of three post card sets of three, they are:\nCosplay set\nDesiree Dear set\nCap got Nudes set\n*please leave a note of which set you would like\nINCLUDES:\nOne of three postcard sets (your choice)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (18 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital gone wild", "descp": "You get a Digital version of all twelve months of the calendar\nINCLUDES:\nThe Digital version of the Calendar", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "2020 The Capalender", "descp": "The one you have been looking for , hot off the press and shipped to you fresh.This is the printed Calendar in all it's glossy full color glory\nINCLUDES:\n2020 The Capalender", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (11 left of 17)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Silver Lining", "descp": "So you want a little something something extra huh ;) , well you want it you get it\nINCLUDES:\n2020 The Capalender\nOne of three postcard sets (your choice)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (10 left of 17)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Impeccable Taste", "descp": "If you want a Calendar for home and one for work then you have come to the right place my liege\nINCLUDES:\n2020 The Capalender\nOne of three postcard sets (your choice)\nThe Digital version of the Calendar", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["3 backers", "Limited (14 left of 17)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Take it all baby!", "descp": "If you want it all like I do then take it!, lets basque in this together\nINCLUDES:\n2020 The Capalender\nThe Digital version of the Calendar\nAll three postcard sets", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (11 left of 17)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Fan Of Fortune", "descp": "Your awesome , no really you are .With this reward get everything and I mean everything.But to show my appreciation I want to say Thank you .Not in the back , or the middle but in the first pages of the calendar , Your name on the calendar is my badge of honor\nINCLUDES:\n2020 The Capalender\nThe Digital version of the Calendar\nAll three postcard sets\nYour name on the Calendar, my thank you for your support", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (14 left of 16)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Birthday Gift", "descp": "For this last reward I want to make it extra special for you and show how much you mean to me by making your Birthday the best day ever, after all you were born so it means something to me .\nINCLUDES:\n2020 The Capalender\nThe Digital version of the Calendar\nAll three postcard sets\nYour name on the Calendar, my thank you for your support\nmy personalized Happy Birthday message to you on your month", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "16 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "2020 Digital Calendars", "update_content": "Good evening everyone , there was some slight difficulties with the Digital photos for the Calendar.

Over the skies of Sapphire City, Demetri Price, known as Akolyte is a beacon of hope. Absolver, the Wraith of Vengeance prowls the gloomy streets of Caesar City. Odina Troussard, known simply as Odina, looks to escape her past in the bustling metropolis of Atlanta, GA. Justice calls Las Sombras- The City of Shadows, his earthly home. Konkret Comics brings you four tales of action, adventure, and mystery. Join us as we enter a universe unlike any you\u2019ve ever seen before.\nFirst and Foremost, Konkret Comics is committed to excellence and storytelling.

The campaign itself is an effort by our company to cut down production/shipping and issue fulfillment time. You have been with us every step of the way, now join us as we make our dreams come true.\n\n\nThe Issues\n\nAkolyte\nAkolyte Issue #1: Son of a Supreme- 24 full pages (all ages)\n     In a galaxy far from his own, Demetri Price finds himself face to face with destiny. He must accept his legacy and embrace a power he never knew, in order to protect the people he loves. Does Demetri have the courage to become The Akolyte, Guardian of the Cosmos?\n\nOdina Issue 1 \" Omni Strike\"\nOdina Issue #1: Omni Strike- 27 full pages (all ages)\n     Written by Onaji Rouse, we find our titular heroine and her Omni Strike team facing Felix Rowe, a man whose powers have grown exponentially. With the fires of their battle barely cooled, Odina and her team learn that Felix Rowe is just the tip of a deepening mystery. Can Odina trust the mysterious stranger with one too many answers? And who is the enigmatic and deadly Lady Tiye?\n\nAbsolver Issue 1 \" Arrival\"\nAbsolver Issue #1: Arrival- 22 full pages (some mature content)\n     Appearing on the gloomy streets of Caesar City, the wraith known as Absolver returns with no memory of his past. With his guide Lea, Absolver will learn his purpose. But he is not the only thing that returned. Something far more sinister has made its way passed the gates of Hell. As their fates collide, is Caesar City ready for the wraith of vengeance?\nJustice \"Zero Issue\" Parley\nJustice Issue #0: Parlay- 10 full pages (all ages)\n     The angel known as Justice has left Paradise and descended through the Firmament. Landing on Earth, he seeks out the only person he knows\u2026 Morning Star. As the world races deeper into darkness two age-old adversaries draw battle lines. But has Justice stumbled into a larger game, one he can\u2019t hope to win against the one creative perfect in beauty and wisdom?\n\n  Contributors\nDerek Allen\nDerek Allen- Creator/Writer/Letterer (Akolyte)\n    Born in Philadelphia, PA Derek had no lack of inspiration. Starting at home with his parents, who encouraged his imagination to flourish, he was also able to look at iconic Philly personalities for encouragement. As a creator, he\u2019s always thought that good storytelling never goes out of style. With Akolyte, he hopes to inspire any little girl or boy that dreams of doing something extraordinary.\n  Brian \"Bats\" Lambert\nBrian \"Bats\" J. Lambert- Creator/Writer (Justice)\n    A native of San Pedro, CA, currently living in Las Vegas, NV, Brian fell in love with Frank Miller\u2019s writing style the first time he read the Dark Knight returns. Miller\u2019s influence, as well as that of Alan Moore and Neil Gaiman, among others, is evident in the way he crafts his narratives. Justice is a book that shows you have everything in you to be great, you just have to take that leap of faith.\n  Onaji Rouse\nOnaji Rouse- Creator/Writer (Odina)\n    Hailing from the Mecca of African-American entertainment, Atlanta, GA, Onaji has always wanted to create worlds and stories for his people. He credits both Stan Lee and Dwayne McDuffie for paving the way for him. Jim Lee\u2019s iconic run on X-Men also had a heavy influence on his style and desire to write comics. Odina embodies the strength in all of us and the willingness to work through the difficult times in our past in order to make a difference in the future.\n  Jermael Lessey\nJermael Lessey- Creator/Writer (Absolver)\n    Jermael was able to cultivate multiple sources of inspiration, having been born in Trinidad and Tobago and raised in both New York and Florida. The Christopher Reeve Superman and 1989 Batman ignited the fire within him, but Spawn set it ablaze. Through Absolver, Jermael wants to create a space where African-Americans can experience a mythos that represents them.\n \nArtist, Colorist & Letterers\n\nBruno Lima- Lead Artist (Covers) (Akolyte)\n    Bruno has been a comic illustrator since 2014. The rhythm and culture of his hometown of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil translates through his art. When not drawing, Bruno likes to gain inspiration from walking in nature. The Dark Knight and Watchmen were very influential on his career and the strong lines and definitive strokes of his art are a testament to that.\n  Hakan Aydin- Illustrator (Absolver/Justice)\n    From his hometown in Turkey, Hakan brings his signature illustration style to the Konkret Universe. Tackling multiple titles, he uses his 8 years of experience to convey the multiple tones and expressions of the characters. In his free time, Hakan likes to swim, is an avid movie-goer and plays videogames.\n  Eric Souza (Blake)- Illustrator (Odina)\n    Spiraling out of his love of X-Men, Wolverine, and Hellboy, Eric became an illustrator in his hometown of Belem do Para, Brazil. He draws inspiration from what he sees around him. Whether it\u2019s the artistry he sees while he\u2019s cooking or the colors and composition he sees while walking, Eric enjoys all forms of art. While not bringing his skills to numbered pages, he is also a video producer.\n  Opi Hidayat- Illustrator (Akolyte)\n    Opi\u2019s early interest in illustration came from his love of Dragonball and anime. He studied graphic design in his home country of Indonesia and became a freelance illustrator in 2014. He works mostly international and has been able to use various different styles from countries around the world. Not only a comic illustrator, Opi also dabbles in video game design and development.\n  Nestor Redulla- Colorist (Justice)\n    Nestor brings his vivid and dynamic color style to the pages of Justice, all the way from the Philippines. He\u2019s been in comics professionally for 5 years and enjoys Deadpool, The Hulk and anything Spider-Man related. When not making amazing looking pages, he spends his time powerlifting.\n  Adalberto Menezes- Colorist (Odina)\n    Adalberto is a fan of Watchmen, and Frank Miller\u2019s work on Sin City, 300 and The Dark Knight. His influences shine through as he brings the illustrations on Odina to life with dramatic flair. In between coloring pages, Adalberto practices capoeira, origami and reads books in Belem do Para.\n  Bryan Arfel Magnaye- Colorist (Absolver)\n    Bryan is from Batangas City in the Philippines and considers Spawn one of his greatest inspirations. It is no wonder then, that his work on Absolver translates that dark/gothic style. Bryan enjoys watching movies and playing basketball when not bringing his talents to the pages of comic books.\n  Michael Woods- Colorist (Akolyte)\n    Michael has been coloring comic books for about 4 years, having migrated from Japanese manga to the American market. He finds his inspiration in all things, from life to art, and anything else that catches his eye. Not solely a colorist, Michael is also an ambitious artist as well.\n  Matheus Huve- Colorist (Akolyte)\n    Matheus has been a comic enthusiast as long as he can remember. He began professionally coloring comics in 2017, having previously worked on his own projects. His coloring style is diverse but influenced by Ivan Nunes, Elizabeth Breitweiser, and Mat Lopes among others. Matheus is a huge fan of Pop Culture and loves horror and science fiction.\n  Rodney Jean-Etienne- Letterer (Odina)\n    Rodney brings his lettering style from Corona, NY to the pages of Odina. His favorite comic series is the Legend of Will Power.\n  Rune Makerz- Letterer (Justice)\n    Rune Makerz is a collection of graphic artists from the West Coast. They bring their signature style to the pages of Justice.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDepending on your location in the world shipping may vary and cause slight delays.

Forever outrunning the horrors of their past, they survive the only way they know how: by hunting and killing robots for profit!  \nLine Art by Salo Farias. Colors by Ander Zarate\nWhen they were just children they watched the war between humans and robots destroy their planet and kill their mother and father.\nInterior Art from Issue 3\nNow, when Sean is kidnapped by the enemy, Shea has no choice but to tear the entire galaxy apart to find him!\nLine Art by Salo Farias. Colors by Ander Zarate.\nTHE BOTS\nThe goal of the robots now is simply survival. After fleeing their home, other planets looked at them as lesser life forms. They were given no aid and left without the resources needed to survive, effectively giving them a death sentence! \nInterior Art from Issue 3\nNow, on the verge of finding a cure to their newfound mortality, some want to bring peace to their kind. While others threaten to rebuild and destroy those who turned their backs on them!\nInterior art from Issue 3\nHere's a preview of Wretches - Issue 1.\nSince writing issues 1 and 2 several years ago, I've grown as a writer. I took my red pen and did a rewrite to much of them to sharpen things up and give readers a more fleshed out look at the world and it's characters. Below is the opening scene from issue 1, re-written and lettered by the series' new letterer, Chas! Pangburn.\nIn the never-ending hustle these past years to promote and get Wretches out into the world, we were able to get Issue 1 published in serialized form in China! This was very cool news when it first happened and it's still a great feeling to see your work translated in another language, and published in another country.\n \u2022Every backer of a physical reward will receive this special, Kickstarter-exclusive print.\nKickstarter Exclusive Print\nNew LIMITED Reward added - only 18 left.\n Click the image for a better look at the prints and their numbered, signed bottom portions.\n(CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE BELOW REWARD AND THE STORY BEHIND US 'GIVING BACK WITH THE 4TH MONKEY')\nJames E.

Action Lab: Danger Zone)\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nFor myself, like so many other creators, Kickstarter has been instrumental towards helping our projects see the light of day. Our work and social media posts caught the eyes of the folks at Scout Comics, who will begin publishing the individual issues in the direct market, hopefully by the end of the year.  Our goal is to put together this Kickstarter Exclusive trade, do a one-time print run, and load it with as much content as we can!\nI've already invested thousands of dollars into completing much of the artwork from Issues 3 to 6 (this way the book is completed and into your hands sooner), and the funds raised here on Kickstarter will go towards completing the artwork, coloring & lettering on the remaining pages, as well as funding the print run, shipping & packaging.\nFunds raised above and beyond our goal will go into stretch goals for our backers as well as be invested back into the series.\n\nOn behalf of the entire creative team, thank you so much for checking out our Kickstarter!\n- James", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks when publishing comics and fulfilling backer rewards, as there are multiple parties involved and unforeseen issues cop pop up at any waking moment! As long as we stay on schedule and the printer fulfills their parts without any hiccups (knock on wood) you WILL get this book in a timely fashion once the campaign succeeds.\n\nThis is my fifth campaign, and I have delivered on every single successful one thus far.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "PLAY\n\nIssue 2 of the Wildcard Chronicles is a 32-page full color fast-paced thrill ride set in the Afrofuturistic Tekhen City, a sovereign African city on U.S. soil in a world where the African continent has united to become the world\u2019s greatest superpower!  This is part of an ongoing comic series  being self-published through Burning Spear Comix.\nTekhen City\nSuper-sized 32-page FULL COLOR issue \n85lb Gloss Varnish 6.625\" x 10.25\" (standard comic size) \nDigital PDF included with every book \nDigital wallpaper pack with every book \nDigital behind the scenes content including character concepts, comments from the creators, and more! \nHigher tiers for t-shirts, original art, and more!\nThe story picks up in the final year of \"The Last Great War\" in 2019CE during the time of the \"Mass Awakening\" and in the aftermath of the infamous \"Night of Reckoning.\" As Tekhen City rejoices, the corporate world begins to regain its infrastructure as it restarts the \"Corporate Initiative.\" Finding new financial backing, drug cartels and tech tycoons are poised to retake Tekhen City - whoever runs Tekhen controls the entire East Coast.\nIn a striking master stroke of events, Tekhen\u02bbs big corporations align with the city\u02bbs newly elected mayor and the drug cartels to shut down the super bike race track, the Giza Grand Prix - a key financial element in New Dendera. This takeover kicks off the legendary Superbike Street Wars, an underground 2-wheel warrior series of street grudge matches that begin in Tekhen City and  spreads around the country.\n We meet a young street racer named Nuri Mauntess as he hears the suspicious news surrounding his father\u2019s death in the Night of Reckoning. As the eldest son and heir to the noble House Mauntess, Nuri must shoulder the weight of his family\u2019s legacy, but is he ready?\nHouse Mauntess\nNuri calls upon his strongest allies to aid in his search for the truth about his father\u2019s death. Along the way, rival biker gangs, shady politicians, and an underground crime syndicate make Nuri\u2019s life a living hell.\nIn the WildCard Chronicles Universe, we created a diverse cast that were selectively chosen and based on real life heroes within our own communities. Our goal is to bring rich characters with well-thought-out backstories that are tied to their cultural background and ethnicities and to inspire others to \"Find the Hero Within.\"\nIn Issue 2, we uncover the origins of the House Mauntess as the book opens with the Court of the Black Lions traveling down the Nile River to the place of the \u201cGathering\u201d, at the Temple of Ramses II aka Abu Simbel.\nAbu Simbel\nWe take powerful Egyptian symbolism, history, and superior technological advances upon which the infamous Giza plateau was built and bring it into the Wildcard Chronicles as the foundation for Tekhen city. Hailed as the Vegas and Silicon Valley of the East, Tekhen is a city full of majestic, mystical wonder and dark secrets.\nFlesh Fantasy Five\nIn the struggle for Tekhen City, loyalties will be tested, bonds will be broken, and heroes will rise from the masses to battle the system created to control them. Will they accept the challenge? Do they have what it takes to bring justice to their city?

We want them to understand that heroes don\u02bbt always wear capes and fly around in the air. There are REAL LIFE HEROES around us everyday and we should aspire to FIND THE HERO WITHIN when life calls us to lead and inspire those around us, while also learning to be accountable for our actions and their impact in our own life and on others.\nInspiring Our Youth\n Therefore, we feel that it is our duty to lead from the front and be the living proof example that fulfilling your dream is possible if you focus your energy, time, heart, and resources into your passions and bringing it to life. \nThe Wildcard Chronicles is our legacy, the mark we leave on this world that will survive when we are long gone from it.  We have really BIG plans for our story and where we can take this into the future.  This is just the beginning.

This allows us to write and create more quickly so that there is less wait time between issues.\nThe funds raised will be used to pay our creative team, shipping costs, Kickstarter fees, and payment processing fees.

All of this is for them and in some ways, it brings them here. \nI want this book to be the kind of thing therapists have in their offices. The kind of book, people who have suffered tragedies, can look to for some kind of comfort. \nThis book is everything.\nParker and the Soul Guardian\nRough layout for a run in Parker has with a protector of the 1st gate\nThe Adventures of Parker Reef is a love letter to the life, I, my family and so many people will never get to experience. On March 14th, 2018, my girlfriend Tana and our son, Parker, died in my arms. It was supposed to be the day we welcomed our son into this world. My third child and Tana's first. \nThis book (90 + pages) is my way of having them in this world in some way. Loss is always difficult and we all experience the pain of someone leaving us. Be it too soon, or after a life well lived, it hurts the same. No more smiles, phone calls...no more anything.\nThis story is about Parker's dream to see me in this world and Tana helping him prepare for that dream. Tana always believed you should follow your dream and that is exactly what Parker Reef will be trying to do within these pages. \nAdventure? Well, you can't just choose to leave the after world and just come back. \nYou have to earn that. \nIn my story, souls are the rarest of treasures. When someone is attempting something like Parker is, ALL are watching. All bets are off and the peaceful land he had been in with Tana is no longer where Parker will be. No, the land Parker will be set in will be dangerous. Full of those souls who have been lost, those souls who did evil while in this world and creatures sent by pure evil to try and stop Parker and covet his soul.  A land full of challenges and adventure. A land Tana has been preparing him for. After all, who knows what their son would wish for more than their parent? \nRough sketch of the moment before Parker sets off on his journey.\nWhen he sets out on his journey (with the coolest of companions..more on that IN the book) his soul is then \"up for grabs\" in a sense.\nIts not just demons and monsters. The story runs deep Into thoughts on the afterlife. Where do we go? What choices do we really control while living?\nIf he fails, his soul could be lost forever. \nThe most selfless act, to choose to possibly lose your own soul in the attempt to rescue another. \nDemons, lost souls, mazes, incredible lands, sweeping landscapes and one boys journey to risk it all to see the father he never met.\nParker will encounter all sorts of creatures and obstacles during his quest to spend a day with me. With a backpack full of special items given to him by his mother, he will set out on his adventure. The catch...even if he makes it, will I know who he is? After all, we never really got to meet.\nThe story unfolds like a video game. Different levels and achievements to get to the ultimate goal; A sit down with the Guardian of Souls and entrance to the land of the living.\nWill he let Parker pass?\nWill Parker be allowed a moment in this world?\nWill he stand eye-to-eye with the other half of his heart?\nWhat I can say, is this book is everything to me. You may know me from First World or other books I have worked on. This book, I hope, can help others who have lost, but I truly need it for myself and for those who knew Tana and knew the love she made you feel. \nThanks for checking out this project.\nI am asking for $14,000 to help pay the creative team, print the 90 plus page book and to help fund the foundation for children in Tana and Parker's name.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "So what's this all about?\nI'm looking to bring out a paperback version of the first volume of LGBTQ+ superhero series The Pride to bring the comic series to even more people, at a fantastic price. \n What is The Pride?\nThe Pride is a comic series about a team of all LGBTQ+ superheroes, representing a broad range of the queer community. Both contextually and metatextually focusing on improved representation and diversity for the community in the superhero format, the comic follows the formation of the team, the individual heroes' personal trials and tribulations and their conflict with a world-threatening villain that they may be the only heroes around capable of stopping. \nJoin FabMan, Wolf, Twink, Bear, Angel, Frost, Muscle Mary, White Trash and Cub as they come together to face off against prejudice, the media and of course dastardly super-villains. And then follow them through further adventures as they tackle lucky thieves, bullying, revenge-killers and even a giant evil drag queen. \nThe Pride brings all sorts of crazy, fun, wild superhero story adventures for anyone to enjoy. \nWhat else is it about?\nIt's also an awesome superhero adventure series consisting a long form main adventure and a series of smaller adventures that build on character and the general drama in a colourful, bright and positive way. \nThe Pride by Ricardo Bessa\nThe paperback book will contain The Pride #1-6, The Pride Adventures #1-4 and behind-the-scenes sketches and designs! 280 pages, at an incredible price!\nWait, you have representation?\nYup, representation is vitally important. Feeling like you are being seen and catered for is a hugely powerful feeling, and despite so many of the LGBTQ+ community being fans of superhero comics and films, it's rare to see people just like them in the medium. \nThe Pride aims to change that, with queer heroes as text rather than subtext, and the community as the heroes instead of victims. Featuring gay, lesbian, bi, trans, queer, gender-fluid, drag queens and straight characters working together, and creating a world with the scope to continue building and include more; inclusiveness is a key factor in the series. \nSo if you've ever felt like it would be nice to see more of yourself in superhero characters and adventures, then The Pride is for you. And it's also pretty accessible to broad range of ages and demographics whether part of the LGBTQ+ community or not...The Pride is really here for everyone. \nThe Pride by Kris Anka\nDidn't The Pride get collected before?\nYes, The Pride was successfully Kickstartered and collected as a gorgeous hardcover collection in 2016. \nHowever, this hardcover is now all but sold out, and it's time to restock with a new edition. \nThis time, we're going paperback, to create something that takes up slightly less shelf-space and is available at a much cheaper price to make it accessible to even more people.\nThe Pride Volume One Paperback edition will contain The Pride #1-6, The Pride Adventures #1-4 and all the behind-the-scenes content of sketches, designs and more, so you'll be getting all that amazing content at an incredible price. \nThe Pride by Cory Smith\nSo why Kickstarter?\nThis campaign is just to raise the funds to cover the print costs for this new edition, so I can keep bringing The Pride to more people who want and need it, in a new, inexpensive and accessible format. \nNo new content to be produced, no new merchandise to produce, just a simple fund raise to cover printing costs for a new edition of the first volume of the LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series only. As such, I'll be running it much more streamlined and straight-forward than usual. \nAs you'll see there are just a handful of reward options, for a copy of the book digitally or in the new paperback edition; or with the latest issue The Pride Adventures #5 to add with your book, and even a special option to get a batch of five copies, ideal for stores or groups looking to get the series. \nThe button badges designs!\nThere's also options to get the book with bookmarks, buttons and some our fabulous enamel pins!\nBear Pin, designed by Gavin Mitchell\nAngel Pin, designed by Gavin Mitchell\nAlso, for all single copy tiers, there's free UK shipping!\nSo please consider joining us on this journey to have fun, accessible and inclusive superhero stories that everyone can enjoy. \nThe Pride by Jamal Campbell\nAbout the creator\nI'm Joe Glass, the writer and creator of The Pride. I wrote the majority of the series, with two shorts written by Mike Garley and PJ Montgomery in Volume One. I've been making The Pride for around eight years now, and have seen the series go from humble beginnings to an international and broad audience of readers the world over. \nWith a wide team of incredible creators (a full list can be found below), I put the series together as it was something I wanted to see in comics, both now and when I was a teen coming to terms with my own sexuality and finding solace in comic books. \nMuscle Mary by Kris Anka\nI've run several campaigns in the past, including the hardcover edition of the first volume, a special limited edition pin design, and recently the very first new issue of content in the series. All have been successful, and have either already been fully fulfilled or will be shortly. \nMy hope is to keep bringing inclusive, diverse comics out that everyone can enjoy, and for those under-represented by the medium to feel they can be part of it too. And all the while, have fun and be positive in my superhero stories. \nPraise for The Pride\nThe Pride #1 was one of the Top 25 Best Selling ComiXology Submit Titles of 2014. \n\"You should support The Pride because it's an important book, but you should REALLY support it because it's a great read.

Some of you may know me as the writer/creator/publisher of the award-winning graphic novel series Malika & E.X.O. However, today I'm here to talk to you about a different topic.\nA little over three years ago I quit my full-time job to start YouNeek Studios. I did so because all my life I've wanted to create stories that are inspired by African history, culture and mythology. Until this point, I have fulfilled this goal successfully by publishing graphic novels.\nMy books have been successful due to an amazing group of fans that constantly support my projects. Everything I've created and achieved up to this point has led me to this moment. I know that it is now the time to move into the realm of animation!\nMalika Teaser Animation Mood Boards by Godwin Akpan\nAnimation? Yes, you heard that right! YouNeek Studios has decided to officially move forward with production of the Malika: Warrior Queen animated pilot/episode one. It's a 3D animated episode (7-minutes long) that I will be writing and directing. The amazing guys at Anthill (who did the animated teaser for our Kickstarter video) will be handling pre-production and production, and YouNeek Studios will take care of post-production.\nOur goal is to start small by creating one 7-minute episode that can act as both a pilot and as the beginning of a series (episode one). We need to raise about $15,000 to cover the entire animation production costs. We understand that there will be some other costs (post-production, miscellaneous additional and unexpected costs etc.), but as a company, we are also going to be investing our time and money to handle those things.\nThe cool thing is that if we're able to exceed our goal, we can do even more! So in theory, just with this Kickstarter, we can produce not only episode one but two, three, four or perhaps an ENTIRE season or movie! Basically, the more money we raise the more episodes we can produce! Check out the stretch goal section below for more info on this.\n\nConcept Art by Godwin Akpan\n\nWhy Malika? I could say we chose this story because it's an award-winning graphic novel series. Or because it's the only African comic to ever be featured during Diamond Comics Free Comic Book Day (2017/18) and Halloween Comic Fest 2017, with comic book stores ordering more than 100,000 copies for those events combined. Or the fact that it features a badass African female lead character. \nBut the simple answer? It\u2019s all of the above.\nMalika Warrior Queen Poster by Godwin Akpan\nSynopsis \nSet in fifteenth-century West Africa, Malika: Warrior Queen follows the exploits of Queen and military commander, Malika, who struggles to keep the peace in her ever-expanding empire. Growing up as a prodigy, Malika inherited the crown from her father in the most unusual of circumstances, splitting the Kingdom of Azzaz in half. After years of civil war, Malika was able to unite all of Azzaz, expanding it into one of the largest empires in all of West Africa.\nMalika Poster by Mohammed Agbadi\nBut expansion would not come without its costs. Enemies begin to rise within her council, and Azzaz grabbed the attention of the most feared superpower the world has ever known: the Ming Dynasty. As Malika fights to win the clandestine civil war within the walls of her empire, she must now turn her attention to an indomitable and treacherous foe that plans to vanquish her entire people. From dragons to mythical relics, a feuding royal family and magical swords, the story of Malika: Warrior Queen stays true to the fantasy genre while adding something new by setting familiar concepts in an awe-inspiring African setting.\nWhat Make's Malika Unique?\nMalika Teaser Animation Mood Boards by Godwin Akpan\nMalika - Warrior Queen showcases the majesty and awe that is medieval West Africa. The costumes, character design, and set pieces all serve to highlight a robust diversity of culture and tradition based on real history. While Malika and her empire of Azzaz are fictional, they are surrounded by actual African states and rulers: bordered to the south by the Oyo, Nri, and Benin Kingdoms; to the west by the Songhai Empire and Timbuktu; and to the east by the Kingdom of Kongo. \nConcept Art by Godwin Akpan\nAzzaz is itself divided into five provinces, each with their local traditions and customs. This amalgamation of African cultures sets the stage for an epic adventure, all as told through the eyes of Malika. As the Empire of Azzaz and the Ming Dynasty, clash, breathtaking fantastical elements (magic, relics, and dragons) are introduced via ancient mythological artifacts and beings called The Divine Ones. Focus is placed on two such artifacts: Dragon\u2019s Destiny, a sword whose powers feed on the wielder\u2019s courage, and Dragon\u2019s Doom, whose powers feed on the wielder\u2019s rage.\nThe Characters\nQueen Malika \nMalika Character Design by Godwin Akpan\nA master duelist and battle strategist by the age of 8, Malika was a child prodigy born to rule. However, she quickly realizes just how heavy the crown is after ascending to the throne following the loss of both parents during the civil war. Determined to make a better future for Azzaz, Malika ends the civil war by uniting all the neighboring kingdoms into one empire. This attracts danger from the outside in the form of the Ming Dynasty, as well as betrayal from within the walls of her empire. These, however, turn out to be the least of Malika\u2019s problems as a cloud darkness approaches Azzaz. Malika must now look to divine power to restore hope to a fractured empire.\nGeneral Cheng \nGeneral Cheng Character Design by Godwin Akpan & Kaiju Den LLP\nGeneral Cheng, an accomplished voyager and military tactician, was sent by the Emperor of the Ming Dynasty to Atala to peacefully investigate the presence of ancient and very powerful relics called the Dragon Stones. Upon his failure to form an alliance with the Atalians, Cheng went rogue and set his eyes on the Empire of Azzaz and Malika herself after she offers aid to Atala.\nKing Bass (The WindMaker) \nWindMaker Character Design by Godwin Akpan\nEver the curious warrior, Bass Kazaar found the Wind Stone, one of four ancient dragon relics, and became The WindMaker. With his newfound powers to manipulate the wind as well as the strength of the Red Raven Army, protectors of the Kingdom of Atala, behind him, Bass goes on to drive Cheng and his forces away from his homeland. Following this victory, Bass is crowned the first-ever King of Atala. Knowing that Cheng would not stop until he gets what he wants, Bass journeys to Azzaz to seek an alliance with Queen Malika.\nAbdul \nAbdul Character Design by Godwin Akpan\nAs First Minister of Azzaz, Abdul is second in command to Malika. Having trained her since she was six, Abdul is more of an adopted father to her. Ever the over-protective guardian, he will go to any lengths to ensure Malika\u2019s safety as Queen.\nChief Dogbari \nChief Dogbari Character Design by Godwin Akpan\nChief Dogbari is a member of The Council of Five, a group of leaders selected from each of the five provinces in Azzaz to advise Queen Malika. While each member of the council is supposed to have a say in matters of the empire, Chief Dogbari, due to his political stature, speaks for the entire council. He is also the governor of the Fon Province.\nMap of Azzaz (Design by Paul Louise-Julie)\nKey locations \nAlthough Malika\u2019s Azzazian Empire and The WindMaker\u2019s Kingdom of Atala are both fictional places, the world they inhabit is very real, as can be seen from the map above. People familiar with African history will definitely recognize names such as Timbuktu, The Songhay Empire, The Oyo Empire, The Benin Empire, etc. Malika: Warrior Queen is sprinkled with MANY Easter eggs regarding African history!\nMalika Teaser Animation Mood Boards by Godwin Akpan\n Anyone who knows the slightest thing about animation knows just how expensive and difficult it can be to produce. For ten years, I've tried to go through conventional channels, putting together a pitch bible and pitching to investors, distributors, networks, and producers. And while I've been able to get close a couple of times (I've met some amazing producers/people who continue to do what they can to help), it has just never happened.\nThis is why I chose to go the crowdfunding route. After all, I've been able to fund all four of my graphic novels via Kickstarter, and I have the same faith that this will be successful, too.\nConcept Art by Godwin Akpan\nIf you want to see more representation on-screen, you are in search of new and unique stories, or you love or want to learn more about African culture, history, and mythology, then I am making this for you. \nThis is a story inspired by African history that ANYONE from ANY part of the world can relate to and enjoy.\nHowever, I can't create this animation without your help. So I hope that you choose to pledge :) Every single, pledge, tweet, share, and comment counts! \nSo what do you say? Do you wanna help me bring something \"YouNeek\" to the animation industry?\n \nMalika Teaser Animation Mood Boards by Godwin Akpan\nOur goal is to start small by creating one 7minute episode that can act as both a pilot and as the beginning of a series (episode one). We need to raise about $15,000 to cover the entire animation production costs. We understand that there will be some other costs (post-production, miscellaneous additional and unexpected costs etc.), but as a company, we are also going to be investing our time and money to handle those things.\n\nThe cool thing is that if we're able to exceed our goal, we can do even more. Basically, the more money we raise the more episodes we can produce! Check out the stretch goal section below for more info on this.\nConcept Art by Godwin Akpan\nAs with any other YouNeek project (our graphic novels, comics, etc.), everything we do is self-funded/bootstrapped, and as always, we truly believe in our fans (current and prospective). We know that as long as we continue to produce quality products and treat our fans like family, there's no project that's too big to attempt. \nI believe that this is no different.\nWhere Does The Money Go?\nMalika Teaser Animation Backgrounds by Godwin Akpan\nShould we be funded (fingers crossed), it will take about 4 months from the moment that we commence work with Anthill until we wrap up the final edit.\nPotential delays may arise as a result of:\nWorking with people in multiple time zones\nEdits\nShipping to you\nUnforeseen circumstances\nThis will be my fifth Kickstarter, so the plan is to use all my experience to make this process as glitch-free as possible.\nOther costs include:\nPost-production\nRewards production\nShipping\nMiscellany\nAll of these costs will be covered by YouNeek Studios.\n\"Malika is the sort of tale that can be appreciated by a wide audience. An engaging tale of justice, bloodshed, wrath, and love, its mythic lessons of good and evil will echo true in many people\u2019s hearts. Its serious subject manner makes it appealing to adult audiences, while its restrained use of violence and the relative absence of blood and gore make it appropriate for children as well. Book 2 took Malika to places I had never expected her to go, making me excited to see what will happen in her future and how her journey fits into the larger story of the Youneek Youniverse as a whole.\"\n- Culture Honey\nRoye Okupe | Creator/Writer/Director\nBorn in Lagos, Nigeria, Roye Okupe is an author, speaker and entrepreneur whose passion for animation led him to found YouNeek Studios in 2012, an avenue that would allow him to pursue his dream of creating a diverse library of superheroes.

But I wanted to describe to you exactly what it means with a true story.\nA friend of mine once told me a story. He said one day while grabbing my book in a comic book shop, he saw a young girl browsing the shelves. She stumbled upon my book Malika: Warrior Queen and her eyes lit up! Immediately, she started to call out to her father \"Daddy! Daddy! Come see!\" Her father hurried to see what all the fuss was about. And when he got there she said to him \"Look, daddy, she looks like me!\"\nThis stuff matters.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving run 4 successful Kickstarter (and delivering all rewards to all backers) before, I am fully confident and also very well prepared to run this Kickstarter smoothly.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Stealth has been in development for over a year with the actual Publisher of Short Fuse Media Group, Sean Mack at the helm writing the plots along with series creator William Satterwhite churning out the dialog. After a ton of work going into this project Stealth is finally ready to take center stage as the newest addition to our stellar superhero line up of titles spearheading our Red Band division of titles.\nStealth #1 Cover\nStealth follows the story of Allen White as he navigates Terminus City as a school teacher by day attempting to educate the youth on real life issues and why those real life issues should matter to them. However, by night, Allen provides an entirely different education to the underworld and evildoers of Terminus City as the vigilante hero known to the public as Stealth.\nSo why are we bringing this project to Kickstarter? The short answer...we need the funding to continue to produce and print these books! The long answer....we LOVE being a part of the RESPONSIBLE Kickstarter community that commit to delivering new and AWESOME projects to our supporters within the community. And to be quite honest, we feel that this title fills a much needed void in regards to diverse content on our roster as well as in indie comics overall, similar to how the newly released Black Panther movie from Marvel Studios is filling a similar void in movie theaters.\nStealth #0 Limited Preview Edition Cover\nWe felt this way so much so that we partnered up with multiple charitable organizations like Hero Nation (Ypsilanti) and The Mighty Jon Youth Movement to offer free issues of Stealth #0 to over 500 kids during the youth screenings of the film! \nHero Nation Announcing that we donated copies of Stealth #0!\nFans Getting Copies of Stealth #0 at Mighty Jon Youth Screening Event!\nWe feel that this project can have a greater amount of reach to fans that will appreciate new and diverse superhero stories using a direct market approach as opposed to going through costly distributors. We've proven this fact with our \"#WeAlwaysDeliver Campaign Promise\" that has allowed us to deliver our books directly to our backers immediately following the completion of our campaigns!!! Our aim and GUARANTEE is to continue  that trend with this project as well. \nAll of the funding will go towards the production of new issues including expenses for the creative team to make this project perfect! The books are complete with only some fine tuning being done to them!!! Other than  checking a last round for editorial concerns, we're ready to head off to the printer so we can get these books into your hands!!! Check out some of the pages below!\nFrom the onset Stealth is heavy on the action!!!\nStealth is heavy on character interaction....\nBut Stealth is also heavy on \"REAL HUMAN STORIES\" and world building!!!\nWe have some really cool rewards and really wanted to focus on the core of what this campaign was about so we tried to keep it pretty simple. Check out a more detailed look below at some of the rewards that we have lined up for this campaign.\nFor starters, we truly felt that this campaign wouldn't be right without going back to the early adventures of Stealth when he was first getting started in Terminus City via the Life & Times of Allen White Graphic Novel Preview. \nStealth Original Graphic Novel Preview Cover\nNext up is the Stealth #0 Special Limited Preview Edition that we released as a primer for this series. Following this campaign, we'll never be offering this title again as there were only a limited number of copies printed. \nWe also have the official 32 Page Giant Sized debut issue of Stealth #1 in all of its glory!!! This issue is a phenomenal debut that perfectly introduces you to Stealth and the inner workings of Terminus City. We are  extremely proud of this book as the production team really kicked it up a notch to produce an amazing comic. And yes, as awesome as the cover is, the interiors are from the same team (as that is a staple that we are pretty consistent with).   \nStealth #1 Cover A\nIf you just want a fix of various comics from our Red Band Division, we are offering our Red Band Bundle as a digital or physical reward  featuring ALL of the titles that are available from our Red Band line including Stealth #1! \nRed Band Bundle (Digital or Printed)\nWe do, however, enjoy seeing talented artist giving their take on our characters. And this project is no different. So we brought on Zenescope artist Sean Hill to illustrate a limited edition Variant Cover B. As you can see, Sean totally KILLED IT on this cover!!!  \nStealth #1 Variant Cover B by Sean Hill\nWe didn't stop there though as we also brought on Image Comics artist Caanan White for another very special limited print edition virgin variant cover (CVR C). What's special about this book is that it will be exclusively printed in Black and White as this is a staple that we have done with several titles within our Red Band division and these versions always look AMAZING! \nStealth #1 Virgin Variant Cover C by Caanan White\nWe also threw in a few items of apparel for you to show Stealth some love with our \"Gear Up\" Rewards. \nStealth T-Shirt\nStealth Baseball Shirt\nStealth Hooded Sweatshirt\nOf course any Kickstarter campaign from us wouldn't be complete without the option of getting custom action figures of our characters (or your own) so check out the packaging and figure for Stealth!  \nFully Packaged Custom Stealth Action Figure\nWe've also brought back the Cameo Cover Variant so if you want yourself or your character featured on the cover with Stealth this would be the perfect option for you.\nSee yourself or your character on the cover!!!\nWe're also using this campaign as the soft debut for our Indieverse Unlimited Action Figure Line where you can be the first to get an official Stealth action figure or even an action figure of your own original character, courtesy of our new division Legion XIV Productions. We've been working on transitioning away from custom figures in order to launch a full action figure line featuring our characters and this is merely the first phase as we have a already been planning the first WAVE. \nINDIEVERSE UNLIMITED STEALTH ACTION FIGURE\nYou can only add items that are in reward tiers that are lower than your primary selected reward tier. If you wish to pledge for items that are in a higher reward tier, you must select that reward tier as your primary reward tier at minimum. Duplicate items from that reward tier or lower reward tiers can be added by increasing your pledge using the pricing below.   \nComic Books - (no increase in shipping fees)\nAdd $5.00 for additional copies of Stealth #1 CVR A  \nAdd $10.00 for additional copies of Stealth #1 CVR B\nAdd $15.00 for additional copies of Stealth #1 CVR C\nAdd $5.00 for any additional comics from our online store\nApparel - \nStealth T-Shirts: Add $25.00 (includes shipping)\nStealth Baseball Shirt: Add $35.00 (includes shipping)\nStealth Hooded Sweatshirt: Add $45.00 (includes shipping)\nCustom Action Figures - \nCustom Stealth Action Figure: Add $90.00 (includes shipping)\nYour Custom Action Figure: Add $120.00 (includes shipping)\nNOTE: Indieverse Unlimited Action Figures are not available as add ons.\nOur first stretch goal will team up Stealth and Spirit's Destiny in a beautiful print from Spirit's Destiny series artist Julie Anderson!!! \nStealth / Spirit's Destiny Print by Julie Anderson\nOur second stretch goal will score everyone some additional comic swag featuring more of \"our\" heroes as physical rewards will receive this awesome \"Our Heroes\" print and EVERY backer will receive PDF copies of Hotshot #1, Pinkwing And The Prime-Controller #1, Vigilance #1 and Tezla #1 along with the digital wallpaper of \"Our Heroes\". \nOur Heroes Bundle\nOur third stretch goal will help us celebrate the one year anniversary of Stealth debuting with Short Fuse Media Group as we revisit the Heroes: Ignited Anthology where Stealth made his first appearance with us. Every backer will receive the digital PDF of the anthology as well as a digital PDF of Indy Comic Premiere Magazine that features an interview with Stealth series creator William Satterwhite talking about the series. \nHeroes: Ignited Bundle\nOur fourth stretch goal unlocks an AWESOME connected pin up featuring our entire Red Band line up starting with Stealth. Each of the following stretch goals unlock a new pin up that connects to the image. But we wanted to make our next stretch reward a bit different...so hitting funding milestones will surely unlock the entire connecting pin up. However, hitting 200 backers will unlock this entire pin up as well. Backers receiving digital rewards will only get the digital image and backers getting physical rewards will get physical prints of each unlocked pin up.  \nRed Band Connecting Pin Up", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we did on our previous two campaigns......THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BEGIN DELIVERING REWARDS THE SAME WEEK THE CAMPAIGN ENDS!!!\n\nWe've managed all of the risks associated with this project by doing the leg work before this campaign's launch.\n\nWe understand the importance of fulfilling our promises and always ensure that all of our supporters receive their rewards.

The teachings we have now are woefully out of date and never touch on ways to depict more that what lies on the surface. \nNot Just another \"How to\" Book.\nTutorial on hair\nHow to Draw Black People isn't a book where artists are provided with facial grids and examples of modelesque people, with some cool poses to try and emulate. \n\nWhile there will be step by step guides artists are accustomed to, this book will include entire sections devoted to: \nAnatomy\nFacial anatomy  \nFacial expressions\nHair\nSkin tone\nCostuming \nCulture and customs \nAnd within these sections we delve deeper into things like colorism, fatphobia, gender expression, and how all these things play into visualizing black characters. Everything cited and sourced, all the research done so artists can trust the info or hopefully use it as a starting point learn more.   \nCrowdfunded and Crowd Sourced. \nWhile I will supply the bulk of tutorials and tips provided in the book multiple talented artists will also give their take on how to approach each topic; how to apply what's being highlighted in different styles, and give their own take on what they believe is important when it comes to creating diverse characters. \n\nAlso in the book will be a wealth of photo reference for artists to take advantage. A compilation of everyday black folks across the African diaspora. Special attention will be paid to the differences between drawing someone from the west indies, Ethiopia, Brazil or South Africa. \nLearn how to depict culture instead of stereotypes \n Artists often feel like they don't know what will draw the ire of a socially conscious community, and they are right; they don't know. Artists are taught by and large to copy but rarely to intuit. Art courses require us to recreate and translate without necessarily understanding the subject. \n\nThat lack of understanding is the cause for a lot of anxiety and unintended strife between audiences and artists. \n\nThe hope is that by focusing on culture, comparing and contrasting the differences between the acceptable and the offensive, artists can better themselves. This book will help artists of all levels create more meaningful, authentic diversity and representation. \n\nBack \"How to Draw Black People\" today and make this crucial resource for artists a reality.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenges for this book are mild at best. The biggest being filling out the roster of artists who will give alternate opinions on subject matter. Another challenge will be finding models and getting the correct photo reference for the purpose of this book, a process I've already begun. The scope of this project will require that outsource the shipping responsibilities to a certain degree and thus any delays in shipping rewards will be incumbent on a third party. \n\nHowever the

It continues the epic sci fi adventure of Ursula, (described by Keith as a super model with a frat boy personality) her glowing green companion Squee, Armando, the absconded earthling, and a cast of characters that are out of this world.  Of course, attempting to thwart her cause is the villainous Azin and his dark energy!  Why is Azin stalking our galactic gal Ursula?  What is the secret reason for collecting the bounty on Armando's head?  And how could things possibly get any worse in the area of space not-so-affectionately referred to as the Suck?\nThe reviews  for issue #1 were nothing short of amazing but don't just take my word for it - check out this review from AiPT: \n http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2016/07/12/into-the-suck-1-review/  \nand this one from Bleeding Cool:\n https://www.bleedingcool.com/2016/07/04/ursula-stormholder-is-headed-into-the-suck/\nAs excited as I am to share issue #2 with all of you - it is also with a heavy heart.  My friend, Keith Thomas, the heart and soul behind Into the Suck, lost a courageous battle with cancer in October 2017.  Among his many wishes, seeing Into the Suck completed and becoming a success was a big one!  He believed wholeheartedly in what we have created!  For those of you who knew Keith - you know his incredible passion for storytelling!  For those of you who read issue 1 or may be joining the universe of The Suck for the first time with this Kickstarter - you're in for one helluva ride!\nBefore his departure, Keith had finished writing the entire 6 issue mini series and was able to see the first 4 issues entirely finished.  He got to see my layouts and some of the final pencil and ink art for the final two issues including the last two issues and the final three pages of the entire series!  \nSo this Kickstarter is about fulfilling a dream and raising enough funds to print each issue and fully complete the entire series... for all of you backers, for all of you fans of Indie comic books, for fans of creativity, for fans of Into the Suck, for friends and believers, and for Keith Thomas R.I.P.\nNow (because Keith wouldn't want this to end on a somber note) please check out our book and delve deeper Into the Suck or Ursula may just smack that smirk off your face!

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THANKS TO ALL OUR BACKERS FOR MAKING SPLIT EARTH SAGA COME ALIVE! WE'VE PREPARED FOR YOUR GRAPHIC NOVEL A BADGE STICKER LIMITED TO THIS CAMPAIGN !!\nSplit Earth Saga is a futuristic fantasy Graphic Novel. 120+ pages, fully coloured, elegantly designed. \nThe writer and artists of this project have devoted 1.5 years in the creative process. This is our first attempt to reach out to an audience with our physical books.\n  Long ago, in the year A.D. 2041, human civilisation had reached an ultimate state of harmony. No more energy crisis. No more poverty. No more wars. All aspects of life as people had known were reaching an ideal state. Humanity celebrated its finest moment. \nThat's why no one saw it coming. \nWithout warning, mountains shattered and crusts broke. Earth had split apart in two, bursting open with a planetary ring. Vast blue light emerged from the divide, mystically locking the two hemispheres in place.\nHalf of Earth rotated in an eerie manner, with only a limited part of its surface remaining habitable due to the precious rotation of night and day. \nThe other half of Earth was not so fortunate. It stopped moving altogether, like a dead weight hovering in space, gradually turning barren under the constant glare of the sun. People named it Everlight, an expanse where menacing spectral beings \u201cAlabaster\u201d roamed.\nDecades passed when the two hemispheres lost all contacts of each other. It was only 13 years ago that humans had found a way to breach through the strange effects of the dividing Blue Light, once again connecting two drastically different worlds.\nRescue missions were planned. Year after year, Warrior teams were dispatched to Everlight, tirelessly bringing surviving humans back to the Habitable Zone. With the aid of newly discovered mineral \"Dark Stone\" deep under Earth's cliffside, human warriors now stood a chance to combat Alabaster.\n A female Warrior must always travel with a male Cultivator, whose blood supply is proven compatible with her unique Dark Stone weapons. \nZerly (code name: Sprite) is a new Warrior. Unprepared and undertrained, her volatile Dark Stone Blades only function with the nourishing blood of her stepbrother Zack.\nShe is far from ready, but the fate of humanity cannot wait. Now High Command is sending Sprite and three other Warriors \u2013 along with all their Cultivators \u2013 on an unprecedented mission. \nWhen stakes grow high and team dynamics change, they are forced to seek answers beyond those of their immediate task. In doing so, they might be confronted with the ultimate question:  \nWhy has Earth become what it is? \nOur artistic style aims to be the fusion of many. To combine the Western approach to power and athleticism, and the Eastern sense of aesthetics in grace and form.\nThe artists employ techniques ranging from European oil painting to oriental brushworks. And the fundamental design gives each Warrior a unique fighting style associated with her Dark Stone weapon type, which evolves and grows as the Warrior does.\nTo counter the Blue Light Zone's corroding effect that disintegrates all inorganic matters, the Warriors must cross hemispheres in capsules filled with organic algae liquid that serves both as protection and outfit. Upon landing, the algae liquid will coagulate along pre-injected tattoo lines on their skin, forming suits.\nOnly trained female operatives may wield Dark Stone weapons. Male Cultivators on the other hand need to release blood at will, not only for feeding the weapons but also for drawing blood seals to dispel besieging enemies. So we've designed various \"Blood Release Pits\" as wearables on mail Cultivators' bodies and arms. \nFleshing out the world of Split Earth Saga - and characters that will eventually steer its fate - is such a unique experience. Our creative team loves this part of the process, and we want to share with you ideas both initiative and polished. \nThus we have included many of our design thoughts in various Rewards, primarily in the Artbook, certain that many of you will find them interesting and engaging.  \n                  Earth - now only half of it rotates against the Blue Light divide, with the other half remaining forever still. The result is the forming of new geographical zones. \nNow the surviving humans fight not only to avoid the eternal glare of the sun, but also to shun the devour of night in certain regions. A thin strap of Habitable Zone is all that\u2019s left for life to thrive on. Or is it?\nImages from the World-Setting Artbook\nOld cities in regions of forever night have seen secret guilds mining Dark Stone for unfair trading, while ancient ruins in Everlight have become bases of operation for hunters of strange relics.\nA long time has passed since civilisation is redefined, and now even architecture in the two hemispheres are vastly different, powered by distinct energy sources and driven by disparate threats.\n  Images from the World-Setting Artbook\nFurther complicating the situation is the Blue Light\u2019s mysterious effect: all inorganic matters disintegrate into dusts when travelling from the Rotating Hemisphere to the Still Hemisphere, allowing only an unidirectional escape, preventing anyone from going back to the unmoving half of Earth entirely. But scientists from the Habitable Zone have successfully built a catapult technology that is able to send trained human operatives the other way. \nNow Warriors are heading back to Everlight, to a world entirely different from their own. And through the the eyes of the young warrior Sprite, we will journey to the heart of Split Earth's mystery as fate unfolds.  \n        From the onset, we knew that simply spending time in polishing the story and artworks was not enough. We must make a compelling product worthy of your hard-earned cash. Therefore we\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of research on how best to produce a physical book that, when you finally hold it in your hands, will be VERY PROUD that you\u2019re one of Split Earth\u2019s founding backers. \nFor the same reason, we\u2019ve designed the Reward Tiers in a way that will echo with different Backers\u2019 inner creative genius. Everyone will find something here that feels right for you. \nWhen it comes down to pricing, we set a goal that touches on breakeven. We believe this is the right decision to set the right foundation stone for the project. Given the chance, we will make alive the world of Split Earth Saga.  \nThis is the book. 120+ fully coloured pages, 7\"x10\" in size. A beautifully rendered graphic novel. Every page breathes adventure!\nThe above is the main reward: Split Earth Saga Graphic Novel. We have painstakingly created the artworks, now it's time to make a great book, worth as their permanent home. Open the pages and follow Sprite in her journey to the lost and forbidden part of Earth!\nOther rewards - each unique in its own way - are listed here:\nThis elegantly designed artbook is about the world of Split Earth Saga, with the creators\u2019 development notes. It contains characters, geography, timeline, technology, monsters, and more. You\u2019ll also read about the artists' design philosophy.\n  Deluxe hardcover set. We will produce the graphic novel and world-setting artbook with their original cover images printed on solid hard covers, wrapped in gloss black dust jackets. A classy gift set for collectors.\n  Four pages of story panels (7\u201d x 10\u201d) selected from important scenes of the graphic novel. Annotations of the writer\u2019s notes reveal how our own collaborative decisions were made while the written language was transformed into the visual.\n  Six illustration prints (4\u201d x 6.7\u201d) of our signature images. At the back of each print, you will see process sketch of that very image, with the artist\u2019 notes, laying bare their thoughts in the image design process.\n   2 Kickstarter Exclusive Prints (7\u201d x 10\u201d) for Deluxe Combo and above. One is the signature team photo. The other is our protagonists in a teasing mood, veiled in soft light. Both are richly coloured by oil painting and oriental brushwork techniques.\n  FREE BONUS for certain tiers! This is the theme music you\u2019ve heard in the video. The MP3 comes in full version. Produced specifically for the mood, this music piece contains hand-played guitar tracks and energetically programmed music arrangement.\n   All Backers' names will be credited in our website (in the order of reward tiers and pledging time).\nWe will also do our best to dedicate page space to the names of as many supporters as possible (when costs and production allows such). So help us spread the word!\nThis is the last mile. Our journey began 1.5 years ago, now all is ready except the last kick. With all your help, together we will make Split Earth Saga come alive. \nARTWORKS BOOKLET - Add $15 to obtain\nWe're creating a booklet that contains at least 30 pieces of our artists' older illustrations. Some are commissioned works (with rights to release) and some are done for fun.\nROSE GOLD BOOKMARK - Add $7 to obtain\nSince we've reached the $16K Stretch Goal, ALL Backers (of physical rewards) will receive a free silver metallic bookmark. Now we're offering an Add-On for those who want an additional bookmark of a different colour - Rose Gold. It's produced with an extra process of plating.\nAnd here's the procedure to place Add-Ons\n1.

We've researched different methods and various companies, calculating local and cross-continental costs and all that. The price gives us a headache. But we ain't gonna let distance stop us from shipping the books to whoever calls for it, wherever you may be. Everest, Antarctica. So the creative team has decided to go with our gut feeling. We are pressing shipping price down to the lowest it can be without jeopardising the goods. So even though the books are gonna come from Asia, Backers from North America and Europe should find associated shipping costs reasonable (The only risks we can't take are the heavy weights, Deluxe and double sets, so we priced those higher). We hope our honoured Backers will feel their money well spent, investing mostly in the book's production instead of delivery. And as the campaign is running its course and long after (if we hit our goal), we will continue to search for the ideal method for shipping so our Backers will be receiving smashing good Graphic Novels without overpaying.

We are also open to any ideas you might have for extras we could include. Just send an email to stealingfirecomics@gmail.com.\nThis Project  \nWe are collecting the first four chapters of Dream Crasher into a single printed 130+ page Volume One. After successfully Kickstarting the print edition of Chapter 1 in March 2016, we went on to self-funded small print runs of Chapters 2 & 3. We will be digitally releasing Chapter 4 with this Kickstarter and later on comiXology. With Chapter 4, our story completes the first of three major arcs. In addition we are including the digital edition of Chapter 5 with every reward tier, which will be released this coming winter.\nDream Crasher is a story about survival and creating a new world from the ashes of the old. It was also inspired by a very real experience of grief. Beneath its dystopian exterior, Dream Crasher is about finding the last bit of light in a world that's gone dark and protecting it with every fiber of our being. Even when the powers that be are stacked against us. Even when the cause seems hopeless.\nDream Crasher Volume One [Not Final Cover]\nThe Story\nFollowing a bizarre cataclysmic event, a group of children struggle to survive in the world filled with angry ghosts, beasts made from human parts, and interdimensional parasites.\nExcerpt from #4: Dearest, the Shadows\nOur story opens with Amalie: a girl who lives alone with a strange beast she calls Creature. She doesn't know what Creature is or where he came from, but she knows that he has her Papa's eyes. The two have been working together since The Long Winter started, but everything changes one day when Creature brings home something that Amalie hasn't seen in a long time: a living human boy.\nExcerpt from #1: Creature's Keeper\nPraise for Dream Crasher:\n\"Like a nightmare dipped in a candy shell\"\n- Ben Beaury, GeeksOUT\n\u201cDream Crasher is a truly unique piece of art.\u201d\n- Comicbooked.com\n\u201cThe start of a fascinating new horror series.\u201d\n- PlayNicePlayNow (PN2)\n\u201cWhen it comes down to the action sequences\u2026 there\u2019s truly no bounds to Olsen\u2019s work.\u201d\n- For the Love of Indie\nExcerpt from #2: The Land Vomits Ghosts\nPrimary Rewards\nPrimary Reward Tiers\n*Signed Copies are price higher primarily due to the fact that Daniel and Reed live on opposite sides of the country (Brooklyn and Seattle, respectively).

It took years of careful planning and perseverance to complete the first chapter, which was published digitally in June 2015. Despite numerous personal and creative setbacks along the way, we have created something we are incredibly proud of. We have been sharing our story with the world one convention at a time. This next step will allow us to enter the graphic novel market while we continue publishing 2 chapters a year until we're finished.\nReed and Dan at Saratoga Comic Con\nIn My Own Words: Daniel\nIn the summer of 2011, Reed and I were on track for releasing Chapter 1 in early 2012. The first chapter was drawn and painted and the second chapter had been started. We still hadn\u2019t thought about lettering, logos, or print budgets - but we had momentum. Then everything came to a screeching halt when my boyfriend died.  \nThe unexpected trauma, the weight of the grief, and the subsequent depression and healing all took their toll in various ways. It was more than 6 months before I was able to return to the project again, and it would be another year before I finished the next chapter. This was in no small part because I gained a whole new perspective on what I was making happen to Amalie.   I was following Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s sixth rule to a T. I was being a sadist and making awful things happen to my main character, but I hadn\u2019t given a second thought to how it was affecting her. I hadn\u2019t thought about how she processed the world around her, or who she was because of it. Through my own grief, I understood her on a whole new level. In many ways, Amalie is a representation of how strong I wish I could be. She\u2019s a survivor, but she makes it look easier than I know it to be.\nDan working on the Chapter 1 Lettering\n While Dream Crasher is a bleak dystopian tale on it's surface, I began to think of this new world less like a graveyard and more like fertile soil. It\u2019s not a story about the world that\u2019s been destroyed. It\u2019s about the new world taking root in its place. It\u2019s about the children who have an opportunity to shape it. Beyond the horror of the present, there is hope. There is a future worth fighting for.  \nUltimately Reed and I made the decision to completely redo the artwork for Chapter 1. It set us even further back, but I can confidently say that we have a better comic because of it. Reed\u2019s patience, understanding, and empathy throughout this project has been instrumental in my sticking with it. There were plenty of opportunities to give up quietly and walk away, and yet we stuck with it. I can\u2019t thank him enough for that. We\u2019re still pushing on, and I believe now more than ever we will see it through to the end.  \nExcerpt from #4: Dearest, the Shadows\nIn My Own Words: Reed  The Dream Crasher story, and Chapter 1 in particular for me, personally represent that relentless monastic fortitude that I have continuously needed to be happy and achieve what I have so far in my life. It is about recognizing the excuses for not drawing after a long day of biking to work and packing CSA boxes with your best friend, but knowing that an excuse does not ink a page, and that I can always sleep later. I hope you enjoy what we have here, it is just the tip of one colossal nightmarish iceberg.\nReed working on the Chapter 1 Prototype\n Our Budget\nGoal: $4500\nThis will cover a full print run of 500 copies plus the production costs of making the book (lettering the fourth chapter,* book design, copyediting, and commissioning original art) and shipping rewards to our backers.\n*Lettering costs for Chapter 1-3 were covered by our first Kickstarter.\nCreature tours the New York City subway.\nStretch Goal: $7000\nThis will allow us to double our print run (1000 copies) as well as include a free Dream Crasher bookmark with every physical reward.\nWe will unveil further stretch goals upon making this one, but the possibilities include: funding the production of Volume 2, original sketch cards for backers $35 and higher, Stealing Fire t-shirts, and even a hardcover edition. We may even ask you (backers and potential backers) what you would most like to see. But in the meantime we'll try not to get too far ahead of ourselves.\nExcerpt from #3 Welcome Home\nPosters & Original Prints\nKeep in mind some available as both posters and original paintings, some are available as only one or the other.\nCreature's Keeper\n--Poster - $55 Tier\n--Original Piece - $100 Tier\nCreature's Keeper\nThe Land Vomits Ghosts\n--Poster - $55 Tier\n --Original Piece - $100 Tier\nThe Land Vomits Ghosts\nThe Dreamer's Parasite\n--Poster - $55 Tier\n--Original Piece - $100 Tier\nThe Dreamer's Parasite\nDearest the Shadows\n--Poster Only - $55 Tier\nDearest, the Shadows\nWelcome Home \n--Original Artwork Only - $100 Tier\nWelcome Home\nVolume One\n--Original Artwork Only - $100 Tier\nVolume One - Original Painting\nCreature in a Red Dress\n--Canvas Painting (by the author) - $100\nCreature in a Red Dress\nSigned Original Proofs\nChapter 2 - Original Proof Copy.\nDistinguishing characteristics: Internal pages darker than final copies, missing Keness logo on the back.\nChapter 2: The Land Vomits Ghosts\nChapter 3 - Original Proof Copy.

If you dig it, he's releasing while we are running this campaign. You check out more of his music on soundcloud.\nStealing Fire Comics\nStealing Fire Comics\nStealing Fire is a name derived from the myth of Prometheus and his act of bringing fire to humankind. It is a metaphor for taking what is needed but not given; for challenging the power dynamics of our present and envisioning new ways forward. It's about eating from the tree of knowledge even though it is forbidden; accepting that banishment from paradise is more honorable than ignorance. We're writing with pictures and drawing with words to rattle the cage of a complacent world.\nThe imprint Stealing Fire Comics was created to launch Dream Crasher in 2015. It was always intended to be a vehicle for multiple creative endeavors, and 2018 will be a year for such things. The first of these was Soulless Golem (Stealing Fire #1), which is available now in our gumroad store. \nExcerpt from Soulless Golem\nSouless Golem is the first of an annual zine series (Stealing Fire #1, if you will). The Soulless Golem drawings began after white supremacist Richard Spencer gave a speech likening non white humans to soulless golems. Drawing on Judaic mysticism and witchcraft, as means of us collectively conjuring a force (golem in this case) to fight back against oppression. The drawings are in direct respond to the Trump administration and the rise of hate as mainstream.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter. All of the artwork has been completed for the story. All that's left to be done is the book design itself, which we already have scheduled.\n\nWe are doing a print run of 500 (1000 if we hit our stretch goal). By doing a small print run we are able to work within a more reasonable budget, but run the risk of the full amount being a bit small after rewards are distributed.\n\nWe are also shipping heavier books this year. We have less rewards than last time, so the process should be a lot simpler after we send the surveys out. Getting everything packaged and weather proofed while being economical can be a challenge in itself, but we are prepared and already have most of the materials.\n\nAlthough the book is longer, the parts are almost the same as our last Kickstarter, and we were successful.

STRETCH GOAL #1 NEXT - $16,000!!\nTHE CROSSOVER EVENT!! \nStretch Goal Crossover Event by Vol 1's Walter Ostlie!\nGiven that my character Is\u2019nana and his father, Anansi the Spider, have been established with the ability to travel through different worlds, I thought it\u2019d be fun to take advantage of this and introduce people to different books and series in the indie comic world. With the stretch goal of $16,000, the Is\u2019nana team are hoping to raise enough money to add 40 extra pages of story content to allow Is\u2019nana to go through these different worlds, each illustrated by their respective creators. The goal is to raise enough money to pay all the artists/creators involved.\nSo we have Vol 1's artist Walter Ostlie's Shiver Bureau, Micheline Hess' Malice in Ovenland, Shauna J. Grant's Princess LovePon, Chuck DragonBlack Collins' Bounce!, Keef Cross' DayBlack, Mike Priebe's Barrdok the Wanderer, and N Steven Harris' and Robert Garrett's Ajala! I thought it'd be great to do a sort of cross promotion between each creator and books and given that I have a good set of readers and fanbases, I'm hoping I can not only introduce readers to more Black folklore and mythological characters, but also get more people into other indie books and franchises. If anyone is able to jump in to help, that'd be wonderful, or even spreading the word and discussing what the mission goal is! So please pledge today and spread the word!\nTHE STORY\nA horror-fantasy, coming of age story, Is'nana the Were-Spider: The Hornet's Web is the second part to an on-going series of one-shots/graphic novels.\nIs'nana the Were-Spider, Vol 2 Cover\nAccidentally breaking a barrier between our world and theirs (called THE MOTHER KINGDOM), Is'nana (the son of Anansi the Spider God of Stories) accepts the responsibility for releasing creatures of horror into our reality, villains who want nothing more but to cause chaos and mayhem to achieve their own diabolical or selfish goals. With guidance from his father, Is'nana not only strives to live up to his father's name but to also reach his own potential while he seeks to discover his individuality and place in the world.\n After defeating Osebo the Leopard, Is'nana must now face Queen Mmboro, her daughter Princess Kantite, and their family of hornets, wasps, and bees who unite and seek to inject themselves into human beings and take over our reality. \nQueen Mmboro and her Harvest\n  Attack of the Killer Were-Bees\n Unfortunatley caught amongst the mayhem is the Baptiste family, Leland, Gina, and Jenka, who fight to survive and protect each other at all cost against Queen Mmboro's evil hive...\nThe Baptiste Family\n ...while Is'nana must not only test his physically limits but also deal with rising tensions with his father who sees fit to control and protect his every move.\nTension between Father and Son\nBe sure to Like and Follow the Facebook Page. \nTHE MISSION\nLast year since the success of the Kickstarter for Vol. 1 of Is'nana the Were-Spider and following the official publication release, the book has been met with acclaim, new fans, and supporters. Fans of Anansi the Spider were welcomed with a modern take on the old mythological folklore of West Africa and the Caribbean, while new fans were introduced to rich characters from old (and sometimes forgotten) stories. Just as the last volume, I hope to continue to make sure these characters and stories are not being forgotten, as Is'nana pushes forth to continue on the legacy of Africana and Black-based folklore and mythology. Your support, donations, while sharing this project through friends, family, and social media will help to further continue this mission.\nAnansi the Spider and Papa Legba of Haitian Stories\nI am hoping to use the funds raised to print copies of not only Vol 2, but reprints of Vol 1 that is currently sold out. This Kickstarter will also allow new readers to pledge for a copy of Volume 1 and catch up with the mission. \nVol 1 (currently sold out) and Vol 2\n WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\nJust like last year, the production of the book from pencils, inks, colors, and lettering are being paid out of pocket. We are currently almost half way through the coloring stages and will begin lettering soon. Money raised will go to final production and printing physical copies of Vol 2 and reprints of Vol 1 (currently sold out) for backers, stores/retailers, libraries, and conventions. Money will also be going into merchandise, rewards, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.\nTHE TEAM\nGregory Anderson-Elysee is the writer and creator of Is'nana: The Were-Spider. On pencils and inks is Daryl Toh (Outer God), with Lee Milewski (Hunter's Lore) providing colors, Joshua Cozine (The Untamed) on letters and production, and last but not least Walt Msonza Barna on the covers!\n REWARDS\n            Daryl Toh (Vol 2 artist)\n  Chris Giarusso (G-Man, Mini Marvels)\n  Miguel Blanco (OogeeMan)\n  Line work by Levi Fari-Raqub / Colors by Leonard Anderson\n  Chris Koehler (Legend)\n              Greg Anderson-Elysee (Is'nana Writer/Creator)\n  Scott Bratek\n   +Add $50 to Original Pin Up Print Pledge for ALL 7 Pin Ups\n       - Anansi the Spider\n- Is'nana the Were-Spider \n- Is'nana the Were-Spider (Spider Form) \n- Papa Legba, Loa God of the Crossroads\n - Queen Mmboro \n- Osebo the Leopard\n- Kantite, daughter of Queen Mmboro \n    (Add $15 to original Pins pledge for all 7 Pins)\n               4 T-shirts to Choose From\n                 -  Change Pledge $70 (instead of $50) for 2 different Is'nana T-shirts, or $100 for all 4 T shirts.\n  Custom Is'nana Funko Pop Vinyl Toy\n    3 of 28 Original Pages from Is'nana Vol 1\n     Add Ons and Prices\nIf you wish to add in an extra reward to your pledge, read below for the prices of the Add On which you will put in addition to your pledge.

STRETCH GOAL!! $16,000\nIf the initial goal is exceeded into the next goal (16,000), an added 40 pages of story will be included in the book for no extra charge. The art will be drawn by Vol 1's artist Walter Ostlie (Shiver Bureau).\nThe story will follow Is'nana on a mission from Papa Legba, the Haitian Loa God of the Crossroads, to find his dog who's gone missing due to Is'nana breaking the barrier between worlds in Vol 1. Unfortunately, other trickster characters from Haitian folklore, Ti-Malice, Bouki, and Kompere Chat have other plans for Legba's dog. Also entangled with his own motive is Jeremy Tableau, a trickster guided by Legba himself, there to ensure Is'nana's quest is not an easy one...\nThe Black Sheep, Jeremy Tableau (stretch goal character)\n The story will also feature crossovers and interactions with characters from  other indie comic book properties like Shiver Bureau by Walter Ostlie, Bounce! the Comic by Chuck Collins, Malice in Ovenland by Micheline Hess, DayBlack by Keef Cross, Barrdok the Wanderer by Mike Priebe, Princess LovePon by Shauna J.

I am expecting Vol 2 book to be fully completed before the end of the year, but added time was added in case of any unexpected delay. Although Vol 2 is already currently being funded, the added pages, if we achieve the stretch goals, may add to a longer wait time for the book due to not just the pages from Ostlie, but also the pages from the guest creators and their properties.

You can also visit Bluegeekmusic.com for more info.  Thank you so much for all of your support.  Without you, none of this is possible.  I can't wait to show you what we come up with!\n--DJ Tony Drake\n   The Indies: An Animated Series is a project that I've been working on for the past 5-6 years.  I saw that there really wasn't an animation that spoke directly to the Hip-Hop community without trying to exploit the culture.  We've had Hip-Hop animations that we all love like Afro Samurai, The Boondocks, and Samurai Champloo.  But we haven't had anything on that scale and that GOOD in a very long time.  Fast forward to today and we're now trying to continue that legacy of dope Hip-Hop centered animation by filling that void with The Indies: An Animated Series.  With a dope storyline, great art, and all original Hip-Hop score I truly believe we can accomplish that.  We've been pitching the full length series and showing our work at Comic Cons which has allowed us to gain a lot of positive traction.     \nWe wanted to take advantage of that momentum, so we decided to start a Kickstarter to raise funds to create an animated short!  This action packed short will give viewers a chance to get to know all five main characters, along with hearing some of the music from our original soundtrack.\nYou want to know what the story is about?  Well check it out below:\nSet in a futuristic dystopian society, The Indies: An Animated Series follows an up and coming rapper named Slick. Born into a well-to-do family living on Earth's Moon, he longs for the opportunity to pursue his dream of becoming a famous recording artist. With a burning desire to make his dreams come true by any means necessary, Slick has a chance meeting with DJ Chops, one of Hip-Hop's biggest DJs and record executives. Chops offer Slick what seems to be an amazing recording contract, which Slick hastily signs without reading the fine print. Slick soon finds out that not only did he sign up to pursue his dream of being a famous artist, but he also signed up for something much more sinister. You see, what Slick failed to realize is that not only are record labels home to some of the universe\u2019s biggest music stars; they also serve as fronts for hitmen for hire services of nefarious crime lords. In order to free himself from his contract, Slick must now work with his new label mates to release his debut album while simultaneously executing dangerous hit jobs. Through these missions, the label mates will explore morality, loyalty, human nature, and discover who they really are at their core.\n    Peep the five main characters from The Indies.\n  We have five main characters in our story, but music is arguably the sixth. It will be an integral part of moving the action forward and setting the mood in this animated short. Since the music is so important we had to call in the best! That's why we decided to record our soundtrack at the Grammy award winning House Studios DC. The producers we've worked with are amazing and have production credits that include Pimp C, Skepta, Wale, Three Six Mafia, Kodak Black, A$AP Rocky, Fabolous, and Wiz Khalifa. Take a look below at some BTS footage of us in the studio creating the music:\n  We wanted to create the world that was futuristic, but also very familiar to people. With that in mind, Tony sat down with our concept artist, Jonathan Powell, and was able to explore what the world would look like once people started living on the moon and neglecting the Earth.  Below is a sample of what they came up with:\n  Why we need your help as told by the creator of The Indies: An Animated Series, DJ Tony Drake:\nSo far this project has been funded 100% by the money I get from my day job as an Electrical Engineer. Everything from studio time, musicians, concept art, comic con travel/setup, etc. I think I've been able to accomplish a lot, but in order for me to take The Indies: An Animated Series to the next level and get this project the attention it deserves, I need your help. We've been pitching The Indies: An Animated Series to investors and executives, and although they love the story and art, they want to know if there's an audience for this. To me, it's a no brainer. But if we can fully fund this project, not only will we get a dope short, but we can prove to the executives that all of us want to see The Indies: An Animated Series on television!\nPan 5-inch Vinyl Toy\n    Most Kickstarters ask for you to donate and then you have to wait until the campaign is over to see if you'll receive anything.  We don't want to do that.  So instead we'll be releasing a free webcomic written by DJ Tony Drake and illustrated by the super talented Icky H.  Each week we will release a couple of panels to tell a story that will conclude at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.  This is our way of saying thank you for supporting us!  You can read it here.\nThe Indies: A Webcomic\n        All the funding we receive will be going towards the animation and delivery of rewards. Everything you see here has been funded by DJ Tony Drake, but none of this money will go into his personal pockets. Outside of fees and Kickstarter reward fulfillment, the money will solely be used for artists and creatives that are contributing towards this Kickstarter. If we are able to exceed our goal, those additional funds will also go towards improving the quality of the animation.\n    Major Contributors\nThere have been many people who have contributed to this project, but I want to take the time to thank all of these people below.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THE STORY\nWelcome to the world of Scissor Sisters, a fantastical reality where the time stream is a living and well-traveled path between wheres and whens. We think you'll like it here, and we'd love for you to stay, check the place out and help us fund printing of this massive, sweeping story. \nLast Summer, with the help of 102 generous Backers, we successfully funded Scissor Sisters, a 120-page graphic novel - the story of Candi and Ash, a pair of women separated by millennia but whose love is an inevitability. They are thrown together in the least likely of times and places and hunted by The Continuum, a cross-time conspiracy of the elite and the sinister deeply frightened of the destiny of the couple they refer to as The Sisters.\nThe Original Scissor Sisters Graphic Novel - Available in a Bundle with Swan Song at the $25 Reward Tier!\nWe loved it so much \u2013 and got so much terrific feedback on it \u2013 that we decided to continue the story in the 54-page graphic novel, Scissor Sisters: Swan Song. This new volume follows the time-tripping assassin Cygnet, vanquished by the Sisters to ancient times in our first chapter, her only ally a friend of one of the Sisters. Faced with traitors to her wicked Master, Cygnet must steal a powerful mask to repair her time-traveling armor and resume her quest to fulfill her mission and destroy the Sisters.\nTHE PROJECT\nThe Star of the Show - Scissor Sisters: Swan Song!\nScissor Sisters: Swan Song is written by Kevin LaPorte (Vicious Circus, Last Ride for Horsemen, Roadkill du Jour, Scales of Time, and The Absentee) and illustrated by Marvel and DC veteran Rich Perotta (Scales of Time, The Ray, Deadpool) with colors by Vito Potenza. Scissor Sisters  was co-created by Erica J. Heflin (Zenescope's Wonderland, Cosmic Times' Flesh of White, and Antithesis). Consider it rated PG-13 for violence/gore and adult themes.\nThis is the second of several planned volumes of Scissor Sisters, all with the same committed team of creators, and our plans go far beyond crowdfunding, to include broad distribution through comic shops and other retail channels! But, first, we have to pay for the initial print run, which is the purpose of this Kickstarter campaign and where you come in!\nTHE PREVIEW\nCygnet stalks her prey...\n  ...and manipulates the very hands of time to secure her enemies...\n  ...frozen in the numbers of her clock, they fall...\n  ...her assassin's skills unveiled, she tightens her temporary alliance...\nCHARACTERS\n  THE CREATORS\nWriter - Kevin LaPorte\nFairhope, Alabama-based writer and co-creator of genre comics with a horror bent, the worlds Kevin creates range from the bayou territory of a lone motorcycle gangster seeking vengeance for his cursed appetite for street meat and the slaughter of his brothers-in-arms (Roadkill du Jour) to dark carnivals overrun by killer clowns violently avenging abused children (Vicious Circus) to dying frontier towns in the Old West beset by Steampunk versions of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Last Ride for Horsemen) to hellish dimensions replete with untapped energy mined by unsuspecting adventurers ripe for demonic possession (The Absentee)!\nArtist - Rich Perotta\nStarting as an intern for the X-Men office in 1993, Rich soon became a staff artist and then a freelance inker for Marvel with a dash of Dark Horse and Crusade Entertainment thrown in for good measure. Rich inked for Marvel for roughly ten years. In 2004, he took a break from comics and in 2010, re-entered the comic industry working for DC Comics inking titles Booster Gold and The Ray limited series. Rich is now pencilling and inking independent titles such as Mice & Man, Magma-Man for Source Point Press and the Scales of Time one-shot and Scissor Sisters series for INVERSE PRESS. Rich currently resides in New York City.\nColorist - Vito Potenza\nBorn in Mola di Bari (BA) \u2013 Italy in 1983, Vito attended and graduated at International School of Comics \u2013 Rome [2005-2008] and subsequently worked as illustrator/comics artist for The First Place and Edizioni Master [2005-2012]. He then moved on to be illustrator and storyboard artist for Video Explainers [2013-today] and has worked from July 2016 as colorist for Inverse Press.\nTHE KICKSTARTER PEDIGREE\nWe have led TWENTY-FIVE previous, successful Kickstarter campaigns for comic projects!

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "15 YEARS AGO I WENT TO BALTIMORE COMICON AND DECIDED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT COMIC CREATOR AND PUBLISHER...\nIt was October of 2002.  I had been making comic book characters and stories for fun since the late 80's.  I was 26 years of age and decided to turn pro as much as a 8 dollar an hour job would allow me to do.  So I had spent the previous 6 years compiling art for a comic book and learning how they were made.  I had a large color printer and a little know how of how to print a zine.  I hand printed about 100 copies of what was at the time: THE REPTILE AND MISTER AMAZING: THE ORIGIN and set out to Baltimore Comicon with said copies, my portfolio and a set of Sharpies, and tried to peddle myself as some fancy-shmancy comic artist and writer.  I sold about 2 dozen copies that weekend and caught the comic book bug.  It was one of the best feelings I ever had in my life and I wanted more.\nFrom there I went on to do a pro job on the Reptile comic, and created and produced several other self-published titles, such as: THE PARANORMALS (2003-2008), THE PISTOLEERS (2008-2010), ADAM AND EVE: BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE IN THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE (2011-2012) and IMPOSSIBLE SPACE TALES OF THE LAST PIT STOP (2012-2017).  Its been a thrill and a privilege to call this my profession and trade over the last 15 years.  I wanted to compile the efforts of that time into one affordable sketchbook and mini-compendium, so that longtime fans can enjoy some awesome new artwork and factoids of their favorite stories and characters of mine.  While uninitiated readers will have a primer to get themselves antiquated with the SANDSHARK UNIVERSE!  \nSO WHAT IS THIS SKETCHBOOK ALL ABOUT!\nThe SKETCHBOOK AND ILLUSTRATED HISTORY will cover all my previous creative efforts under the 21st Century Sandshark Studios banner, including:\nTHE REPTILE AND MISTER AMAZING\nTHE PARANORMALS\nTHE PISTOLEERS\nADAM AND EVE: BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE IN THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE\nIMPOSSIBLE SPACE TALES OF THE LAST PIT STOP\nEach segment will have new art along with character and story synopsis, as well as behind the scenes production notes.  Basically its a sketchbook and illustrated guide covering my 15 years of self published projects in a 28 page primer!\nOn top of all our past glories, we will be focusing on  future endeavors such as our upcoming SPACE TALES TPB, and CHICKEN: USDA REJECTED projects!  \nNot to mention this will be 21CSS's first FULL COLOR PROJECT!\nAlso included all copies will sport a BLANK SKETCH COVER for those of you who are familiar with my efforts as a sketchcover artist.  Here is your chance to get a quick sketch or full commission piece with your very own individualized art cover piece!\nSO WHAT'S IN THIS FOR ME IF I BECOME A BACKER?\nFirst off!  We will have a myriad of rewards as we always do for our Kickstarter projects.  Rewards such as:\n-SIGNED AND QUICK SKETCHED COPIES OF THE SKETCH COMIC!\n-MINI PRINT SETS!\n-FULL SIZED 11X17 PRINTS!\n-SKETCHCARDS!\n-SPECIAL SKETCHCOVER FULL COLOR PIECES ON YOUR COMIC\n-9x12 and 11x17 ORIGINAL ART PIECES!\n-PRODUCTION ART!\n- SPECIAL COMIC STORE BUNDLE DEALS\nOn top of that we will have stretch goals laid out if we get above and beyond our very modest $750 goal.

I've been a comic book fan for most of my childhood and adult life. Comics have ignited my creativity and given me the drive to create stories and characters that can inspire and touch the heart of those who never saw themselves as being the hero. My desire since launching my very first black white comic in 1992, has been to create characters of color that would represent the very best African and African Americans have to offer. And thus Purge was born. After a year of sweat and tears, Purge - A New Direction is complete. A labor of love that was forged through a collaboration with KID Comics. Now together we are ready to take the next step.\n        WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO BRING PURGE TO PRINT!\nProduction costs have already been taken care of and all that's left is printing. Now I need YOU to help get this project over the finish line. We plan to send a completed issue one (32 pages) of the book for print by the end of August. The estimated cost for 1000 copies is about $2,500.\n              FIND OUT WHAT YOUR BACKING WILL PRODUCE!\n  Purge - A New Direction Cover By Keithan Jones and Xong Bros\n  Interior Page By Larry Stroman and Mshindo Kuumba\n  Interior Page By Larry Stroman and Mshindo Kuumba\n  Interior Page 9 Illustrated By The Xong Bros\n  Interior Page 14 Illustrated By The Xong Bros\n  Interior Double Splash Illustrated By The Xong Bros\n  Interior Page 19 Illustrated By The Xong Bros\n  Interior Illustrated By The Xong Bros\n  Interior Page 16\n                                        VARIANT COVERS\nPurge - A New Direction Variant Cover A\n  Purge - A New Direction Variant Cover By Larry Stroman\n  Purge - A New Direction Variant Cover C By Charles Ben Jones\n   Purge has taken on the mantle, hero of New Salem, a state-of-the -art metropolis he himself designed. The vision of New Salem is to build a true utopia within the network of modern America. However, nefarious forces threaten to destroy that vision and exploit Purge's para-natural abilities for their purposes. Now more than ever, Purge must live up to his title as the purifier, the protector of the city and the people he vowed to lead to a better world. Can he do it?\nRichard Kincaid is haunted by a dark past. A past he can barely remember, but will never forget. Something horrific yet incredibly prolific transformed him into the man he is today. A man with the mind of a computer and the power of a god. Today he is Purge. \n If this is your first introduction to New Salem's first and most famous hero, then know that he has a long history.  Purge debut in 1993 and has been featured on Entertainment Tonight, USA Today and Newsweek. Recently he has graced these social media outlets.\n                                                                       NEW SALEM \nNew Salem Concept Art By Tan Ho Chin\nNew Salem is the first fully functional mecha city in the world, whose infrastructure operates on an undisclosed number of complex and centralized software platforms working in unison. It's believed mystical forces of African origins are at play that maintains the city's vibrant allure and citizen solidarity to build a leading and self sufficient society.\nNew Direction Designs by Keithan Jones\nPurge - A New Direction Style Guides\n  Purge - A New Direction Style Guides\n  Purge - A New Direction Style Guides\n The Creative Team\nRoosevelt Pitt, Jr. (creator, publisher, writer): I am the creator of Purge, and a thirty year plus veteran in the comic book industry.

Unfortunately, we are too far below our goal so we are canceling the project with under 24 hours to go.

Want to be flown out to NYC for a live seance? We got it! Want US to fly to YOU dressed as our characters for Halloween and scare the beejebuz out of your neighbors? We'll do it!\nCheck out the new rewards now!\nWhen Ed Wood set out to make Plan 9 from Outer Space, he never knew what a cult following he would create.\nHe set out to create a movie that featured many of the things that scared people in previous horror flicks: Aliens, Zombies, Vampires and Ghouls. Seeing humanity as the ultimate threat to life in the universe, the aliens come to exterminate us. They do so by reviving our recently dead and keeping them under their control. \nIn the end, the humans win, of course, but the aliens never come back. They run home with their tails tucked between their legs. There was no Plan 10... until now. \nSo, where do the aliens go when they've already attempted to use our own dead against us? What if they discovered they need not raise zombies from the grave to defeat us when we already possess devices that make us zombies? What if they could hack into that device and use them to make us their puppets? \nPlan 10 from Outer Space Cover 1\n That was then..this is now.\nIn this updated sequel to the Ed Wood classic we answer the question: Why raise the dead to destroy humanity when our cell phone culture is doing a fine job of it on its own.\nThis is Mike Dolce, host of Secrets of the Sire podcast and co-creator of this new Kickstarter campaign with writer James Mascia:\nPlan 10 From Outerspace.\nOur story takes place in the tiny town of Carmel-By-The-Sea, reimagining the original Plan 9 for our modern times. In this version, our heroes are no strangers to fiendish ghouls, vampires and zombies and quickly dispatch the so-called threat.\nThe aliens are left with no choice: Plan 10: enslave humanity through a mobile app called Sentient and destroy us one cell phone at a time.\nTo make our 64-page graphic novel come true we\u2019re looking for 7,500 dollars, the cost of which will be applied to our artist Osiris Junior, our cover artists Soussherpa and Tony Moy and to our various rewards.\nDo you like sketch packages and massive comic books rewards? We got em. How about being drawn into the book with a speaking line before you\u2019re unceremoniously decapitated? Yep, it\u2019s there too. And the ultimate packages include Live Radio Air time as a guest or co-host on my show.\nTruly, this Kickstarter is unlike any that has come before\u2026or before that or before that. This is Plan 10.\nIt\u2019s humans vs aliens vs technology for the fate of our world.\nPage 1\n  Page 2\n  Page 3\n  Page 4\n  Page 5\nWe have some great rewards for this campaign, including exclusive prints, comics and graphic novels. Certain rewards will even get you (or someone you choose) drawn into the comic! You can even be a guest on Mike's radio show, Secrets of the Sire. Or maybe you have your own comic project--our cover artist would be glad to design your cover for you!

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi guys! Welcome to my kickstarter. My name is Keithan Jones, the founder of KID comics and creator of, The Power Knights! The PK is a team of characters I originally created when I was eleven years old. As I grew older and pursued a successful career in graphic design, I found myself doodling the PK in my spare time. This growing feeling that I owed my eleven year old self a shot at turning the PK into a real comic, became too strong to ignore. It was time. I spent the better of the last two years, writing, drawing, and coloring issues #1 and #2 of The PK. In the process of doing that, I also founded a publishing brand called KID to release the PK under. I'm hoping you guys will be inspired to help me print, market, and distribute, The Power Knights #1 and #2 for all to enjoy. Thank you so for your support!\nThe Power Knights: Unbounded #2 cover\n  The story is focused on two brothers, Kandle and Davion Watson, and how their lives were completely upended by their encounter with six uniquely powered warriors, Metal Star, Bluzara, Dragon Blaze, Camouflage, Princess Raxi and Warseed. These extraterrestrial warriors were sent into a blackhole, to die for war crimes they committed against their will. Yet, they inexplicably survive, and crash land on Earth. To avoid detection from mankind, some assimilate into society, while others live reclusively in the shadows. Warseed however, scoffs at taking a backseat to the weaker human race. He desires to take command of his own destiny by transforming humans into a powerful hybrid army to take control of Earth. Davion Watson, mourning the loss of his father to an incurable disease, is seduced by Warseed's promise of a new world, where disease and suffering are eliminated through science. Inedibly, Warseed soon discovers, mankind is not so easily tamed, as he is ultimately betrayed by Davion.\nWhat happens next is chronicled in the pages of The Power Knights: Unbounded #1 \u2013 #2 and beyond.\nKandle and Davion Watson. Brothers torn apart.\n  Warseed and the other Knights share a dark past.\n      From Left: King Sinoj, Octa-Gun, Warseed, Bluzara, Metalstar, Princess Raxi, Dragon Blaze, Lion Storm, Camouflage, Rebellion, Detective Tripli, Lieutenant Nikubum\n The Power Knights # 1 debuted in 2015. It was the first comic released under the KID comics brand. KID is a comic book publisher dedicated to bringing back the fun and adventure of sequential art. We are about the synergy between the reader and the page! Meaning, you are a part of the creative process as you flip through the pages. You add the sound of the heroes' voice or the clanging of deadly blades as warriors fight on cosmic battlefields. That is the uniqueness of comic books, it is a subconsciously collaborative medium. If you've never read one, make a KID comic your first. Enjoy!\nThe Power Knights: Unbounded #1 cover\n  These t-shirts are like magic! Put one on and presto, your day instantly gets brighter! See Reward #5 \"Wear Your Power Proudly!\"\nWhite-T available in SM/M/LG/XLG\n  Black-T available in SM/M/LG/XLG\nEvery reward includes a copy of The Power Knights #1! Let's take a look at a few pages from that issue...\n      Now let's take a look at some pages from The Power Knights #2. The good news is, this book is already completed! However, it needs your valuable support to be printed and distributed for all to enjoy! \n      Where does the money go? The chart below breaks it all down...\n    Kandle is a teenage firebrand. Full of aggressive energy, ready to take on all comers even when it's against his better judgement. On the surface he's brash, but it's just a front to hide the pain he's feeling for his tormented older brother, Davion. While others feel Davion is too dangerous to live, Kandle has taken it upon himself to save him by any means necessary.\nWeapons: A Lightning Shield that discharges bolts of concentrated electricity. Enhanced strength, generated from his fusion kevlar jacket. Both the shield and jacket were designed and engineered by Dragon Blaze.\nDavion Watson, older brother of Kandle Watson, has gone partially mad. Barely surviving an attack by Warseed, his life is spared by Dragon Blaze's, ingenuity. An exoskeleton is grafted into his skin, to keep his body functioning through two micro-nuclear generators implanted into his shoulders. It has given him paranormal strength. Unfortunately, it also has damaged his mind and he suffers from bouts of severe paranoia.\nWeapons: The HEL canon and an assortment of fire-arms collected from fallen enemies.\nDragon Blaze is a cybernetic flesh being of unknown origin. At least unknown to him as part of his memory has been deleted. He is an AITron-Type 9, AKA an engineer. He was specifically created to design and build machinery that utilizes the natural elements of any environment or world he finds himself on. Under the control of King Sinoj, he was forced to design weapons of war.\nPowers: Plasma Fire, Flight, Organic Digital Processors (computer mind).\nOcta-gun is a US government alpha-agent. He has no super powers. He relies on his field training and weapons constructed from technology reverse engineered from the spaceship the Power Knights crashed on Earth in. He is self assured and fearless. His primary mission: Bring The Power Knights into United States custody.\nWeapons: A multi-cannon that fires 8 different elements: Fire, Ice, Electricity, Sonics, Lasers, Stun Beam, Nano nets, and a very dangerous distortion beam.\nPrincess Ozana Raxi is daughter to King Sinoj. Ozana is torn between the love and hate she has for her father. This causes conflict and mistrust from the other Knights. Her unique Oraxion fighting skills derive from her royal lineage. Her super dense skin, allows her to endure high-pressure impacts and extreme temperatures.  \nWeapons: The Oraxi Spear. The Oraxi Spear can take the form of three; a sky creature, a land creature and a sea creature. Ozana can see through the eyes of these three creatures as they aid her in battle when necessary.\nGet the infectious theme song of The Power Knights, \"It's Yours\"! Written, composed and performed by the rising star, Clifford \"Switchmatic\" Kennedy. \nCover art for the Power Knights theme song MP3.\n    Just for you guys, I will be posting a FREE short story called, PRESSURE- A POWER KNIGHTS STORY.  Take a glimpse into Davion Watson, AKA Rebellion's life as he comes across a young man who is contemplating suicide. It's a story that expresses some of the deeper themes found in the Power Knights.

In the beginning, there were hundreds of thousands of beings called scribes. They consisted of many different races and used their abilities together to create new worlds and new life. But over time, there were a few who began to want something for themselves, a life, a family. Someone to love them and something to call their own.\nThis resulted in several scribes leaving the ranks and creating worlds for themselves\u2026worlds and denizens of these worlds who began to worship these scribes as gods. This didn\u2019t sit well with the others and sparked a division in the ranks of the scribes. There were those who took upon themselves to try and forcibly remove these \u201cfallen scribes\u201d from their worlds and strip them of their power for fear that it might be used for ill.\nIn turn, this fueled the fire for a war amongst the scribes, a war that lasted for billions of years. Realizing that they could not be destroyed and the only way to stop it was to interrupt and essentially restart the process, the eldest and first among all scribes used his power to merge his brethren all together into a single entity, that which is believed to be the Touchstone and placed it at the far edges of the universe. Then the first scribe released his own spirit and abilities into four artifacts and relinquished his body to be absorbed into the Touchstone. When the four artifacts connected with the Touchstone, a cataclysmic event wave erupted from it, a \u201cbig bang\u201d if you will, destroying the old universe and creating a new one in its wake, scattering the artifacts across the universe.\nthe ARTIFACTS\nUltrakyle is intended to be a monthly all ages science fiction action adventure comic 24 pages in length with no ads. It's a finite story with a BEGINNING, a MIDDLE and an END plotted out as 12 issues a years for 3 years.\nTo give a quick overview of the story: the Stylus finds Kyle, who is the Last Scribe. Kyle begins to use the stylus to create all kinds of things including a really wicked suit of hi-tech armor for himself and his friends, Tobias and Char, and brings to life his own comic book creation, Cybear, the cybernetic warrior bear. In between all this, we also are introduced to Z\u2019itt, an evil alien emperor from the planet Draxill and learn of his quest to find and possess the Stylus for himself, with help from Alacarr, the only living being in the universe who is known to possess one of the actual artifacts (the staff of scales). Alacarr only helps Z\u2019itt for fear of harm coming to his own family, which Z\u2019itt holds captive there on the ship with them as they travel in search of the Stylus that they know to be on Earth thanks to the mystical bond all the artifacts share with one another.\n Writer/Artist Don Edwards' links: \nwww.facebook.com/donedwardsart\nwww.facebook.com/ultrakyle\nwww.facebook.com/diamonddstudios\nwww.instagram.com/donedwards1\nwww.donedwardsart.blogspot.com\nwww.twitter.com/greenduckie\nwww.twitter.com/ultra_kyle\nKyle.\nTobias (Tobes).\nChar.\nAlacarr\nCybear.\nMonMon Zunah\ndesign for emperor Z'itt's Warship\nZ'itt.\nFart Wobbah.\nR.O.B.B.O.T\nRain Godega.\ndesign for Rain Godega's shuttle\n\nThe Rewards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk is life.

Every time, I try to create something I\u2019ve never seen before; this is my starting point.  \nI enjoy working with a variety of digital and traditional media, mostly in stylized realism and surrealism. Though, frequently I force myself to work outside familiar media and techniques, so I can achieve a more diverse body of work. I focus on art and themes free of a social/political grounding and can be interpreted in different ways by viewers. To me, that is the mark of timelessness, and art that can be enjoyed by people regardless of their differences.  \nMy work has intrigued viewers, interested them, made them uncomfortable and inspired them to seek meaning where there is none. When I look at my art, I see an escape from the real, a constant challenge to improve, and a means of communication beyond spoken word.\"\n-Rob Cannon\nABOUT ROB CANNON\nRob Cannon was born in Sacramento, California in 1989.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Super Natural\nWho is Super Natural? Super Natural is a superhero character I created to be used as a supporting pivotal character in Anthony Piper\u2019s superhero parody entitled \u201cTrill League\u201c. In the world Anthony created, she sticks out like a sore thumb in comparison to the other character\u2019s personalities. This was intentional as she is designed to be a vehicle of \"pseudo normality\" that readers can anchor to when things get too crazy. Her name refers to her moral stance against portraying herself as anything but a natural black woman. This includes her appearance, her diet and her lifestyle. Super Natural is not from earth, yet she has come to make a home here after some quick transitions into city life. She is immensely powerful and nearly invulnerable to all physical damage, but not immune to the everyday stresses of living in American society.\nSuper Natural Tranquil Stretch\nSuper Natural Flying High\nWhat is TRILL LEAGUE? Created by Anthony Piper, TRILL LEAGUE is an idea that started off with him drawing well-known superheroes but adding a bit of humor and urban edge to them. Having sparked hundreds of fan art submissions, becoming a trending topic on Google, and having thousands of shares on Tumblr and Facebook. Check it out if you haven't already. \nTrill League\nWhat is the premise of the story? Super Natural is relatively new to this planet and has found herself in harsh adjustment to the ways of American culture and life. She will soon find that power breeds much more than just the ability to assert your will, but also fear and sharp critique from those that lack such power. \nShe will have to deal with the media, the local law enforcement, the military and the US government itself as she learns firsthand that being powerful has powerful consequences. The first few books will be an origin story of sorts, an introduction to who Super Natural is, where she comes from and her daily life and reasons for being on earth. \nWho are the main characters? \nDeja Popper-  \nDeja Popper\nOne of the closest and most valuable relationships that Super Natural will form very early on in her story will be with an amazing 5 year old named Deja Popper. Not only will Super Natural learn about the basics of earth and culture through this child(even though some of those basics will be flawed at times), Deja will be the very one to introduce the concept of becoming a superhero and what it means.\nLaShawndra Popper-\nLaShawndra Popper\n  LaShawndra Popper is Deja's mother, and she's not at all too happy about her daughter's \"friendship\" with Super Natural. While she is an outstanding example of a hardworking single mother, LaShawndra has lived a rough life and is swift to shut down any ideas that go against her own no matter what. She wants what's best for her daughter and has been banished from at least two elementary schools for her sharp criticism of Deja's previous teachers. Sparks will fly in her opposition to Super Natural even remotely being near her daughter.\nBradey & Sofie Balogun-\nThe Baloguns\nThe Baloguns have lived as successful farmers for over 40 years until their health began to deteriorate. Their relationship with Super Natural started off simply as a supplier of fresh produce, but quickly formed into something very personal as she volunteered to help tend the land and other physically taxing responsibilities around the farm. Very few others have a such a intimate relationship with Super Natural to the point where she considers them as family. Wisdom is the invaluable gem given by the Baloguns and will help ready Super Natural for the worse to come.\nSo what is the purpose of this KICKSTARTER? As a freelance illustrator, every business decision has to have a very planned and thought out foundation, and self producing a comic book is no exception. Everything from producing the art, securing the right printer, paying for the print run, to delivery of such a product will take careful planning and tons of energy. \nSuper Natural suit design\nKickstarter is a creator's way to determine if there are folks that actually want the product he or she is planning to create. If the campaign is successful, there's no doubt that all that planning will be justified. I would love to bring this character and story to life, and Kickstarter is one way to know if there's a people that actually agree.\n.\nWhere will the money go if this campaign is successful? The initial goal is to raise $4,500 to produce the FIRST Chapter of the comic series. This will cover time to spend working on the comic and reward items as well as printing and shipping expenses. This is the bare minimum needed. The first issue of the comic consists of 22 pages of story, a character bio section and fan art gallery section, so any additional funds above the initial $4,500 will allow me to work on more issues of the comic, as well as collaborate with other talented artists to speed up productivity (see Stretch Goals below).\nSuper Natural suit design\nWhy do I believe this story should be made? Super Natural is more than a character at this point in her creation, and embodies many wonderful positive themes that comic readers both young and old, male or female can benefit from. Her story will address dozens of tough issues that very few comic publishers have ever dared to touch and I believe such a story is needed more than ever in these times. \n BACKER REWARDS\n STRETCH GOALS", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any creative project, there is a chance of delay for presenting a final product.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the world of Dark Legacy. The planet of Titan is at war and the Kaiser, an evil battle-mage, is bringing this world to its knees. Anything is possible here and anyone can become a legend. This is where your journey begins.\n\nWill you join the Kaiser and his allies in the total domination of the planet or will you be part of the opposition? You get to decide how this story will tell itself. Make sure to choose wisely, for the fate of the planet lies within your hands.\n\n It's time to Make your choice!\nAbout this project.\n\nDark Legacy is a project that has the ability to give something to everyone. Instead of dividing the RPGers and the Card Gamers; this game has the ability to bring them both together in one game and keep them engaged with the story and possibilities of their own character's growth. Dark Legacy is a game that is easy to pick up and yet complicated enough through strategy to keep even the most experienced player entertained. It is my goal, with you help, to get this in the hands of hundreds of gamers so they can experience a different kind of gaming all together.\nWith this second set of Dark Legacy, named the Dragon Epoch, I have added a couple of things that will enhance the gameplay from the previous set, The Rising. In this set I am trying to involve the player even more in the storytelling aspect of this game. With the Dragon Epoch I am introducing Class cards. There will be 20 different classes to choose from in the Dragon Epoch. Each Class card will grant the player an innate ability that will be unique to that Class. The 20 classes for the Dragon Epoch are\nKnight\nFreerunner\nNinja\nSorcerer\nWizard\nTank\nHealer\nFighter\nPurist\nSummoner\nAlchemist\nHero\nVillain\nScholar\nGunslinger\nThief\nBlacksmith\nShifter\nRanger\nScout\nI am going to use six specific classes within the Starter Decks for this set. Here is the breakdown of the six class going to be used\n\nThere will be a Holy Order faction Knight\nThere will be a Darkness faction Shifter\nThere will be a Tech faction Gunslinger\nThere will be a Chaos faction Wizard\nThere will be a Earth faction Summoner\nThere will be a Wind faction Freerunner\nAnother new aspect of Dark Legacy is going to be Skill cards. Each Class has a three skills that are unique them them and them only. There is a level 5, 10, and 15 skill cards. These cards will give a unique advantage and suggest a type of play style of each character. \nHere are the examples of both the Class abilities and Skills from each of the six classes that were mentioned above.\nLastly there is one big addition to Dark Legacy, DRAGONS. \nThe addition of Dragons to this game bring an extra mechanic to creatures, DEGENERATION. Degeneration makes it so that the creature doesn't regenerate at the beginning of the controllers turn. Now this might sound bad but when your creature that has 150 defense points there needs to be a why to get rid of that creature. \n\nSo if a creature has degeneration on it and takes damage, its overall defensive points go down. Once it is at 0 then the creature is destroyed just like any other creature. \nThe Goal\nMy Kickstarter goal is set at $8,000 and this covers the minimum of costs to finish the art, edit, print and ship the game. The total of the funding goal is comprised of 10% Kickstarter fees and Amazon fees, 70% printing cost, 0% artist, layout, editing and development costs (since I am doing the majority of this myself), 10% promotional costs and 10% shipping costs. Should I be blessed enough to raise beyond the $8,000 target several things will happen: \nI have six pre-determined pledge amount stretch goal rewards and six pre-determined amount of people pledging stretch goal rewards to give everyone if we reach the goal. Everyone who pledges $20 or more will be included in the stretch goal rewards.\n This is the image for the first stretch goal by Milivoj Ceran.\n This is the image for the second stretch goal by Chrisyopher Rush.\nAbout the game \nDark Legacy is a unique strategy game that mixes the best elements of Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons and Chess and wraps them all up into a in-depth sci-fi/fantasy story. In Dark Legacy, players are no longer bystanders of the battle, they get to be part of it as a war general within one of six different factions. With the unique and various weapons, armor and relics, that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be. \nIn Dark Legacy, it is the players objective to destroy their opponents and their armies, by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in real battle you will have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.\nDark Legacy is a game that can be played one-on-one or in team battle, ages 10 and up, with an average play time of about 45 minutes.\nWithout Kickstarter backers, I wouldn't be able to produce this quality trading card game for the hobby market. To show my appreciation to those of you who are taking a chance on me, I promise that all games, PDFs and prints will be in the hands of backers before any copy will be available to others, whether it be through retailers, conventions or in my online store at dark-legacy.net. In addition, any items that are listed as limited editions will never be sold or distributed outside of this Kickstarter project. I would like to thank you again for your consideration and your support. Thank you very much!\nHere are the basic type of cards that can be played in Dark Legacy\nIn addition to these cards there will be Class cards and Skill cards added to these basic types.\nHere is some information about the playing mat.\nHere is a video about the mechanics of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter my first Kickstarter I realized that the main issue I really have to deal with is the quality control of the cards. This time around I already have a printer and I have worked with them for a couple of projects so I know what to expect. I have a good group of people who will help with the construction of the decks once they arrive.\n\nIf any issue to arise I will let all of the backers know immediately and will keep them in the loop for the entire process so that they know where they stand and when they should receive their rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 44, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kaiserstudio/dark-legacy-the-dragon-epoch", "project_name": "Dark Legacy: The Dragon Epoch"}}, {"backer": "Eric M.

(See pics below in the rewards section).\nSTRETCH GOAL #3\nShould we hit $12,000 we would immediately begin production of BOOK TWO! EVERYONE gets the first 10 pages of E.X.O. PART TWO!\nMore info & pictures below!\nHey guys! My name is Roye, and I am the creator and writer of E.X.O. I was born in Lagos, Nigeria, and I fell in love with superhero stories the first time I laid my eyes on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon. In 2008, after noticing there was little diversity in superhero narratives, I decided to tell a story about a hero from Nigeria/Africa. I wanted to add something unique to the genre. To do so, I started YouNeek Studios and began work on E.X.O. - The Legend of Wale Williams Part One.\nAs seen on\nRead more about E.X.O. on These Blogs\nE.X.O. - The Legend of Wale Williams Part One Cover Page\nMy mission with E.X.O. - The Legend of Wale Williams is to put Africa on the map when it comes to telling superhero stories. As you can see from the trailer above, this whole thing started out as an animated project about 3 years ago, but due to several difficulties (financing, distribution etc.)  I decided to make it a book first. We have so many people with a wealth of creative and appealing stories on the continent, but they never really get the proper commercial exposure. I myself experienced this when I approached investors and distributors. I was told it was a great idea, but there was no fan base for this sort of product. But I refuse to believe that. I believe that if it\u2019s done properly (with great script, good production values, etc.), people all over the world will be receptive. We don\u2019t necessarily love characters like Superman, Batman or Spiderman because of where they are from. We love them because they have great stories we can identify with. That's why I took my time in developing the story and characters. I hope that E.X.O. will fulfil my lifelong goal of adding something unique to the superhero genre.\nE.X.O. - The Legend of Wale Williams Part One Page 3\nE.X.O. - The Legend of Wale Williams is a superhero story about redemption, set in a futuristic 2025 Africa. The graphic novel will be broken into two parts. Part one, which is 130 pages, is already halfway completed (with fully colored pages with lettering) and is set for release August 2015. You can read the first chapter for FREE right here on my website.\nI started this Kickstarter campaign because I am on the last leg of this very long and amazing journey. Production costs have already been taken care of and all that's left is printing. Now I need YOU to help get this project over the finish line. I plan to send a completed part one (130 pages) of the book for print by the end of June. The estimated cost for 1000 copies is about $3500. \nSo, friends, family and superhero fans all over the world, I humbly ask you for your help in making my lifelong dream come true by guaranteeing that E.X.O. becomes a reality!  Thank you all for your support!\nE.X.O. - The Legend of Wale Williams Part One Page 4\nLagoon City, Nigeria 2025. Tricked into returning home to Nigeria after a five year absence, an impetuous young man named Wale (pronounced Wah-leh) Williams embarks on a journey to investigate his father\u2019s mysterious disappearance. His only clue is a cryptic Nanosuit left behind for him by his father, a suit which grants superhuman abilities. As he comes to understand the suit\u2019s powers, Wale realizes he must restore hope to the city by preventing catastrophic attacks from the sociopathic extremist, Oniku.\nFURY Concept Art\nThe support I\u2019ve gotten so far for this project has been nothing short of amazing. I\u2019m greatly humbled by the number of people that have tweeted, retweeted, shared and blogged about E.X.O.\n\u201cThe designs are very slick and futuristic, and ignore some of the design stereotypes which frequently turn up in many \"African set\" productions created by less intimate creators. At an initial glance, it has all of fast paced action and hi-tech superhero antics that you would expect of most animated action series on Cartoon Network or NickToons, only it is featuring a brand new hero for a brand new era. The world is a big place, and there's room for heroes from all lands in it. Keep an eye out for the first volume of \"EXO: the Legend of Wale Williams\" this summer!\u201d Alex Widen | The Examiner\n\u201cIn a time when the public is beginning to demand for a more diverse slate of superhero comics and movies, YouNeek Studios aims to fill that gap with a library of eclectic characters.\u201d Jamie Broadnax | Black Girl Nerds\nEXO certainly looks like a fun, well thought-out project, and something that could indeed go far towards putting Africa on the superhero fiction map.

Cooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "DINNER AT 6 is a dark look at what results from a marriage full of deceit, treachery, and secrets.  Roxy is the model wife.  For her, life is fulfilled.  She has a wonderful, successful career as a nurse; a beautiful, smart daughter; and a handsome, dedicated husband.  But every day, as she muses to herself, \"what more could I ever want from life,\" little does she know darkness has already crept into her perfect life.\n\nAfter fifteen years of marriage, Roxy's husband David comes home one day and tells her that he wants a divorce. This, of course, sends Roxy into a psychotic spin -- especially since he never even gives her a reason; he just walks right out!\n\nRoxy spends the next three months lamenting over what she could have possibly done wrong.  She finally decides to take matters into her own hands -- because her marriage isn't going to end without her learning the truth.  And it's not going to end until she says it does...\n\nA kidnapping, a cabin, and Dinner at 6.  One way, or another, Roxy will get her answers!\nThe message of this project is simply be yourself.  We live in a world where we are often told that we are not enough and that we won't be accepted if we truly live our truth.  What results from us often not living our truths when our lives are connected with other individuals is hurt and pain. There are families that are torn apart because deceit has lived with them for such a long time and the web of deceit becomes difficult to break.  This project in its own dark way is about how if we truly as a society allow others to live their truth in the best way that they can tragedies can sometimes be avoided.  \nWe're planning to put up the play and are scheduling for a two week, eight show run.  The funds we are raising from your generosity will go for the following items:  Theater rental and security deposit, advertising and promotion, materials and labor for set construction, makeup, props, costumes, and more.\nIn addition to the play, we also plan to shoot a short film version of the story for entry into film festivals.  And so, a portion of the funds raised will pay for lights, cameras, and other production equipment, as well as the location, and any fees required by the Screen Actor's Guild -- this will be a SAG endeavor.  We also need to pay for makeup for special effects -- that's gonna be a surprise -- and a number of other small and not so small items necessary for  creating a top notch production.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sherida Mulrowe\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nSherida Mulrowe is an Actress/Writer.
