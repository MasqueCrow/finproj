[{"backer": "Comic Crusaders", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome (back) to Morgan's Organs, a comedy comic book series like Pixar's Inside Out but for grown-ups. We're back to bring you the next installment in the 'sitcomic' adventures of Morgan and the crazy organauts living inside his body. Are you ready to see what might really be going on inside our insides?\nIn 2016, we introduced Kickstarter and the world to Book 1 of our quirky concept, and in 2017, we returned with Book 2. Thanks to the love and support of our incredible fans, we're able to return for Book 3 of Morgan's Organs. The great thing about this series is each story is standalone - you can read it in any order and still enjoy the heck out of it!\nIn Book 1 (click to preview), we witnessed Morgan's two \"heads\" of the body clash for control of Morgan's decision-making, all while Morgan battled the pressure to end a dry spell.\nIn Book 2 (click to preview), we cringed as Morgan dealt with the pains of swallowing something he shouldn't, and the consequences it would have for the organauts as it moved through his digestive system.\nThis time, we're bringing you a story riddled with alcohol, phallic artwork and a secret Morgan wish he never knew. And what I am most excited about is that we're using an unconventional narrative style for this book with a structure similar to that of Christopher Nolan's hit movie, Memento.\nTake a look at the Book 3 preview pages below!\n Dick drawings, black eyes and amnesia, oh my!\nMorgan's Organs is the brain spawn of me - Daniel Brodie. After a couple years of pursuing the idea as a television series, I realized that the best way to bring my idea to the world would be to make it happen myself. So I partnered with the incredibly talented artist, Robert Jennex, to create the world of Morgan's Organs. Rob brings an incredible vision and spark to the series, and none of this would be possible without my Canadian partner-in-crime.\nWe're also excited to continue to have Tyler Kelting from Oklahoma, USA, on our team as the series colourist. Tyler joined us for Book 2 to handle the full colours, and he has brought an incredible sense of discipline and creativity to build on the Morgan's Organs style.\n(From left to right): Daniel, Rob, Tyler\nThis series focuses on Morgan as he navigates everyday college life, which is made difficult by the fact that he isn't completely \"human\". Inside his body lives a variety of organ-like characters (called organauts) who control his various body systems and ultimately, are keeping him alive. The problem is these organauts don't always operate with the best interests of their host in mind.   \nThe stories take place on two levels. Outside, we follow Morgan and his group of friends as they navigate college life. Zoom in to his insides and we see how Morgan's struggles are made worse by a group of organauts who bicker, lie, cheat, argue, act selfish, and generally, don't work together as one.\nStretch Goals Unlocked!\n\nClick to learn more about this stretch goal\nClick to learn more about this stretch goal\nMake sure to read the below highlights about our rewards. \nBelow is a summary of the various reward tiers. Most rewards tiers build on their previous tier.\nAll of the below tiers include physical rewards. Shipping is incremental to the dollar amount indicated.\nI have always tried to be transparent about the budget for my Kickstarter's and what the funds will be used for. I don't see this as a business - not yet, at least. These campaigns are part of my long-term vision to have Morgan's Organs picked up by a publisher, and eventually made as a television series. All of my rewards are priced appropriately to cover exactly what I need to support this vision. That means covering artist salary, production (including printing), and packaging/shipping. \nI pay my artist team what I am able, but we have a mutual understanding this is a partnership and we're investing in a long-term vision. Between Book 1 and Book 2, I was able to increase my per-page-rate for the art team. I hope to be able to do so again for this campaign by exceeding our campaign goal.\nOur Kickstarter goal of $4,000 CAD supports the below:\n60% = artist salary\n30% = the 4P's - printing / production / packaging / parceling (shipping)\n10% = Kickstarter fees\nEverything raised above this goal will go to a combination of:\nAdditional printing (further driving down per-unit-cost and creating opportunity to invest in our stretch goal rewards)\nIncreasing artist salary\nConvention booths at future events\nFuture stories in the series!\nBook 3 is already more than 75% complete - we only have about 10 pages left to ink and 20 pages to colour. Our goal is to deliver all campaign rewards by end-July/early-August.\nRead some of the past coverage we've received on Book 1 and Book 2 of the series!\nStarburst - Book 1: 8/10 stars - \"Smutty, slapstick yet spectacularly striking in its approach and relatability, this is a battle of the heads that\u2019s an absolute riot to watch unravel.\"\nStarburst- Book 2: 8/10 stars - \"Even more charming and funny than its predecessor... a hell of a fun ride.\"\nComic Crusaders -\"Daniel lays out a wonderful story that I, no WE, need to read more of! The art is great, Robert brings to life the world of Morgan\u2019s organs with a clean, animated style.\"\nComixBrew - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs is the kind of comic that is good to show your buddies for the laughs but also contains a deceptive amount of depth.\"\nComic Unknown - \"If you ever wondered how Inside Out would have worked through the eyes of a male college student, look no more. Morgan's Organs is a gut-busting comedy that while the idea has been seen before, it is the fresh take we need and want.\"\nBleeding Cool - \"Morgan\u2019s Organs #2 hits a rhythm that the first issue only brushed up against. With this issue, each character has its place, and the situation is so ludicrous that it really lines up with the surreal premise of the comic.\"\nThe Outhousers - \"The delightfully cartoonish art and exploration of maturity help [Morgan's Organs] defy expectations. It's a satisfying read for those that love thoughtful comedy.\"\nIf you've gotten this far, might as well read the rest of it! I'm honestly humbled that Morgan's Organs is even a thing in this world. I remember six years ago, I was embarrassed to even spill my idea to friends. Now, I am on my feet at Conventions, shouting at people walking by my booth to check out a comic that features a talking penis.\nThe reception to the series on Kickstarter, online, and at events has been incredible. I am not in this industry to make comics - I'm here to make Morgan's Organs! With each book, I get closer to my goal of getting picked up by a publisher so that I am able to make books more frequently, and who knows, maybe one day I can go back to my original dream of making this into a television series.\nOnly more books and more time will tell what the future of Morgan's Organs holds... oh, and your support for the series!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks, schmisks! We've done this twice before already and know exactly how to execute a Kickstarter campaign. In our previous two campaigns, we delivered within one to two months of the original promised date, with delays simply because we wouldn't sacrifice time for quality! This campaign, we have even more of Book 3 complete than ever before to ensure we can deliver that much sooner.\n\nShort of Rob and Tyler getting enlisted to be the first humans to land on Mars, there is nothing stopping this project from happening. And even if they do end up on Mars, I'm sure there will be decent Wi-Fi connection for them to keep working between their less important, interstellar missions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Atom", "descp": "Every dollar helps!\nThe description in the below tiers indicates the feature reward available.

The printers are very experienced and regularly print all the Death Sentence comics, rewards and art prints, which has always gone very smoothly.

UKIYO/genius loci brings an entirely new twist to the 300-page, critically-acclaimed graphic novel. This 12 issue series expands upon the original material and brings depth the the world of these characters.

We've launched aggressive social media campaigns across almost every conceivable platform as well as some guerrilla tactics with the help of some unnamed friends. \n\nAfter that will be production.

Now he must decide whether it's safer to keep it a secret or if the truth will set him free.\n$45,000: UPGRADE U \nAll pledges $25 and up will now include a 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d mini-poster of Jamal\u2019s illustration of Juncture and Kareem. Pledges $50 and above will receive an additional 11\u201d x 17\u201d large-format poster of Khary\u2019s cover.\nAdditionally, all $25 rewards will include a custom BLACK branded bookmark, and $50 rewards and up will receive three bookmarks, representing each faction within the story.\n$55,000: THE BEAUTIFUL STRUGGLE \nFight scenes in comics can be brief and have a lot of dialogue that wouldn\u2019t be possible in a real fight. It\u2019s been part of Kwanza\u2019s dream to do an epic, cinematic fight scene with minimal dialogue and loads of action.\nThis goal would add 20 extra pages to the climactic battle at the end of BLACK. Expect all-out action that will give the characters more room to show off their skills and abilities.\nPLUS we\u2019ll include a hint at what\u2019s to come after the conclusion of BLACK.\n$65,000: BIRTH OF A NATION \nHow long have Blacks had superpowers and how has it been kept secret from the world at large? Kwanza Osajyefo and Tim Smith 3 will reveal insights from the lost pages of the Mann family diary dating back as far as the 15th century to present day.\nThe story will be a limited series published via LINE Webtoons and on BLACK\u2019s social media channels after the graphic novel is released.\n$100,000: TOUCH THE SKY\nFor our final stretch goal we\u2019re aiming at $100,000 to make the book physically bigger \u2013 6.6 x 0.2 x 10.2 inches to be precise. Doing so means adding to weight, printing, and shipping costs but we\u2019d love for people to read BLACK at the same size as most other graphic novels.\nCHARACTERS\nBLACK is a 120-page story that is comprised of six chapters. If we reach our funding goal, we'll begin work to release issues monthly on digital platforms starting mid-2016.\nIn advance of the printed book backers will receive issues as DRM-free PDFs in addition to the entire digital volume (with extras!).We're also offering other rewards including prints and special art; please scroll through and pick something you like.\nREWARD HIGHLIGHTS\nAfter Reward 2 most subsequent rewards include a limited edition of BLACK. This special version will only be available to Kickstarter pledges of $25 and up. \nPledges above $50 will receive extra swag with their book, and $100 will get you a copy signed by the whole creative team and your name on the thank you page in the back of the book.\nAlmost all of the funding amount will go towards illustration, production, and delivery of rewards to our supporters.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nCreator/Author\nCreator and writer of BLACK, Kwanza Osajyefo is a former digital editor at Marvel and DC Comics \u2013 best known for launching DC's Zuda imprint, which published series like the award-winning Bayou, High Moon, Night Owls, as well as Supertron, Celadore, Black Cherry Bombshells, Bottle of Awesome, and I Rule the Night.\nCo-Creator/Designer\nCo-creator and designer of BLACK, Tim Smith 3 (A.K.A TS3), has been working in the comic industry for over 15 years. He created and self-published Red After the Party, and has worked on hit titles for some of the biggest publishers in the industry!

Last year, I began working on a series for AHOY Comics called THE WRONG EARTH. That series is heavily steeped in different styles of American superhero comics, which require me to switch between my approaches to the story. That lead me to rethink how I was going to tackle WHITE. I had the opportunity to visit Japan, particularly Akihabara, Tokyo, Kyoto, Shinjuku, and do a deep dive into Manga and anime. It has seriously affected my view on how to tell the story of WHITE.\nIt also has changed how I approach working with the team. Even at this late stage in our careers, I can see how much Kwanza and Tim have grown as writer and designer over the last few years. It shows in the words and the scope of what they give me to work from. I\u2019d like to think that my evolution as an artist has continued as well.\nNow, don\u2019t get me wrong: I\u2019m the utility player here.

We are both excited to bring this story to life.\nLeft - Daniel, Right - Rob\nWith your help, we can build the next great comedy series as we discover what might really be going on within each of us.\nMorgan's Organs follows university student Morgan as he navigates growing up, while the operators of his internal organs learn to work together to help him tackle all aspects of life.\nThe comic transitions back-and-forth between Morgan's world and the world that exists within his body. On the exterior, Morgan is your average college student learning to make sense of the world. \nZoom in to his body and we see why life is so difficult for him. His body is host to a variety of characters, each with their own desires and their own flaws. One thing is guaranteed - it's no wonder Morgan is so unsure of what he wants when his body parts can barely work together.\nIn this first issue, Morgan faces conflicting pressures to break a dry spell. Meanwhile, within his body, his organ operators go head-to-head for central influence over Morgan's decision-making. \nThe story will tackle many questions. Who should we listen to? What does it mean to be a community? And, why does our body embarrass us at the worst possible moments?! I might not always have answers, but I do have plenty of ideas.\nFeaturing inappropriate dreams, elevator embarrassments, carnival erotica games, and the smartest appendix you've ever met - I believe you're in for a thrilling journey as we explore who, or what, might really be in control of us.\nLet's meet Morgan and some of the organ operators, AKA \"organauts\", living in his body...\nBran the brain is the leader of Morgan's group of organauts. He tries to balance what's best for Morgan with what his body wants, but it's tough when Morgan doesn't always listen to logic.\nPepe the penis is the talking genitalia we've been waiting to see. His impulsive nature leads him to butt heads with Bran's rational approach. You can't blame the little guy for just wanting to have some fun.\nHugo the heart has an even bigger heart himself. He is caring to the emotions of others and is an advocate for \"true love\". Sometimes he just wears his heart too much on his sleeve. \nThere's plenty more organauts ready to come to life with your help. Kidneys, appendixes, livers, butts, and more! Plus, Morgan's friends, and even a potential romantic interest. We'll learn more about the various micro-beings within Morgan's body in this first issue, and hopefully, in future editions too!\n(top to bottom, left to right) - Morgan, Meats the stomach, Lou the lungs, Pepe the penis, Bran the brain, Hugo the heart\nThe list below highlights the added reward specific to each level.

The seductive and merciless Gemma Zavala, aka Mama Z, heads the cartel. Anyone she can\u2019t bribe or intimidate ends up paying the ultimate price as a human sacrifice in her Aztec rituals. Ruthless, blood-thirsty with influence far and wide, the Zavalas appear unstoppable. \nUntil they murder the wrong girl. \nReturning home from the military, Maria Diaz was a beautiful young woman with a bright future. She wanted to be a social worker, to give back to the community she loved. \nThat dream died in a bloody instant. \nDays before Dia de los Muertos, Maria\u2019s brother betrayed the Zavalas. The cartel sought retribution and slaughtered the entire Diaz family, committing unthinkable acts of brutality in the process. \nMaria, beaten and shot, crawled from the burning ruins of her family home only to succumb to her wounds. \nBut something brought Maria back. She was too pissed off to stay dead. \nNow, under the harsh tutelage of her mentor Faustino, she hunts the Zavala Cartel without mercy. She claims the name Muerta and paints her face in the Mexican calavera style\u2014a hauntingly beautiful skull. \nHer weapons: fear, stealth, and cunning. \nHer goal: to avenge her family and send the Zavala\u2019s to hell, even at the cost of her own humanity. \nIn the tradition of Desperado and Death Wish, Muerta is a stylish, Mexi-Noir thriller with ferocious action to burn. \nTHE DETAILS\nLa Muerta #1: Descent  is a 48 page, square-bound all new graphic novel. It\u2019s a \u201cDay of The Dead\u201d version of The Crow meets Deathwish. \nThe first story arc will be told in two 48 page \"chapters\". La Muerta #1: Descent is the first chapter. \nLa Muerta #2: Last Rites will be offered in spring 2016 via Kickstarter.  If you want your revenge stories richly realized and visually spectacular, I invite you to back La Muerta!\nTONE & STYLE\nLa Muerta takes place in a very stylized, very dangerous version of present day Los Angeles. It\u2019s a city painted in long, shadowy strokes contrasted with dark, wet colors. Visually, two hit films inspire La Muerta\u2019s tone and visual style\u2014a style we call \u201cMexi-Noir\". \nDESPERADO: With its dynamic shooting style and over-the-top action sequences, it\u2019s easy to see why Desperado greatly influences La Muerta. Specifically, our film takes inspiration from Robert Rodriguez\u2019s gritty, visual pallet of warm desert hues that bake the rough mission style buildings. This is the daytime world of La Muerta\u2014a dusty, sunburnt noir.  \nTHE CROW: If Desperado helps inform La Muerta\u2019s daytime imagery, then Alex Proyas\u2019 The Crow inspires its nights. The Crow\u2019s dark, brooding vision externalizes the story\u2019s gloomy emotional tone. La Muerta will embrace the same shadowy imagery and gothic locations, yet give them a unique Latin twist. It\u2019s an urban underworld where Aztec graffiti adorns dark alleyways and where the sad laments of Mariachis serenade the dead. \nTHEMES: \"RAGE AND SACRIFICE\"\nThere\u2019s nothing like a tension-filled, exhilarating action movie. But the best of the genre often stretch beyond explosions, car crashes, and martial arts mayhem. In this spirit, La Muerta strives to explore thematic concepts and social issues without preaching to the audience, or worse\u2026 slowing down the action. \nTHEMATIC QUESTION: In La Muerta, as Maria systematically hunts down those who butchered her family, she confronts a difficult question: \u201cDo you need to sacrifice your humanity to defeat evil?\u201d The question exposes a theme explored in other revenge dramas such as Charles Bronson\u2019s Death Wish. Like Bronson\u2019s character, Maria is overwhelmed by rage, and the line between her and the violent criminals she stalks becomes dangerously thin. Maria even feels a perverse satisfaction in snuffing out the killer\u2019s deplorable lives. \nHowever, Maria never completely submits to the bloodlust as Bronson\u2019s character does. She never enjoys killing; instead, she sees the act as a necessity to achieve justice. \nTHE CREATIVE TEAM \nBRIAN PULIDO (Creator, Publisher, Art Director, Me): I created and published the Chaos! Comics universe including Lady Death, Evil Ernie, Purgatori, Chastity & dozens of other characters. I was inspired to create this story after attending the \"All Souls\" Procession in Tucson, Arizona. This event directly ties in to Day of The Dead. I found the experience beautiful and haunting at the same time.\nMIKE MACLEAN (Writer): Mike\u2019s crime fiction has bloodied the pages of numerous anthologies, magazines, and websites, including The Best American Mystery Stories, The Deadly Bride, Thuglit: Hardcore Hardboiled, and Ellery Queen\u2019s Mystery Magazine.

Kros is a dream project and Kros' story is one we have been wanting to tell for a long time.\nTHE STORY\nSet against the backdrop of the Battle of Gettysburg during the Civil War, KROS: HALLOWED GROUND is a tale of horror that follows the story of Vampire hunter, Major Kros, who fights two wars. During the day, Kros fights the battle history remembers. At night, he fights a secret battle against supernatural forces. \nKros himself is an enigmatic character. He\u2019s a dampyr \u2013 a vampire hunter \u2013 and has some of the vampire\u2019s abilities. Long lived, Kros cares nothing for the politics of ordinary mortals. The Civil War means nothing to him. Kros is on the trail of the undead. There are considerable dangers to Kros as well--and death is not the worst of them. Blood calls to Blood and there is always the danger that could be turned and become that which he hates. \nAround Kros are ordinary people, civilians and soldiers from both the North and South in the midst of a cauldron called Gettysburg. They have faced the conflict and horror of the battlefield and now must face an even greater horror. Vampires have followed the armies and come at night to feast on the fallen. A second battle is fought at Gettysburg of which the history books know nothing. That\u2019s the tale we want to tell. We\u2019ve waited a long time to tell it. With your help, it will happen.\nThe KROS: HALLOWED GROUND 128 page graphic novel will include character and production artwork by Tom Mandrake, cover/poster art, as well as a short KROS story by John Ostrander.\nKros: Hallowed Ground pg 1\nKros: Hallowed Ground pg 2 color\nKros: Hallowed Ground pg 3 color\nKros: Hallowed Ground pg 4 color\nKros: Hallowed Ground pg 5\nKros : Hallowed Ground PG 6\nKros: Hallowed Ground PG 7\nTom Mandrake Sketch Card Example\n  Black and White Vampire Portraits\nVampire Portrait examples by Tom Mandrake of Team Kros Vampires, Sian, Justin, Jack and Jan\nLimner's Wagon Portrait \nArt by Jan Duursema\nKROS: HALLOWED GROUND REGIMENTAL PATCHES AND 'SUTTLER'S TOKEN'\n    THE CREATORS:\n John Ostrander\nThe Spectre, Suicide Squad, GrimJack, Maritan Manhunter\n John Ostrander is a comic book writer whose inventive imagination has brought a myriad of stories and characters to the comic book industry.

Each team is creating an original series of stories. Each series is interesting, informative and funny in its own way. Together they weave into a common creative universe. \n2T will publish the 1st issues of our 1st 10 series in one big bang on September 16, 2015. Then, we\u2019ll publish our next 10 #1\u2019s in a bigger bang in 2016.\nABOUT DOUBLE TAKE\n16 years ago, Bill Jemas played a lead role on the team that transformed Marvel from an insolvent comic publisher and toy manufacturer into a world-class entertainment company.  \n\nTake-Two Interactive (T2) is a world-class video game publisher. Two years ago, T2 hired Bill to help start a new comic book publisher...\n\nNow the 2T team is a dozen strong! We have recruited scores of writers and artists, editors and designers.\n\nABOUT YOU\nOn September 16, 2015, you can buy at comic shops:\n\n      Any of 2T's print issue #1's for $2.50 to $3.50\n      A Super Pack of all 10 print issue #1's for $20 to $25\n\nBut right now, you can preview the 1st scenes of the digital storyboards of our issue #1's on your phone and order a Super Pack for only $10. (The print issue #1's in the Super Pack will be very different from the digital storyboards; scroll down for an inside look into the first pages of Z-Men #1: Nervous in the Service!) \n*Psst...This may not be the final design and art of the Super Pack!\n\nWe'll ship anywhere in the United States for $5 shipping cost.\n\nBut we'll cover shipping if you order the \"Hundy\" display case of 10 Super Packs (10 Super Packs x 10) or the \"Kilo\" (10 Hundies x 10). \n\nThe Hundy (*Psst... This may not be the final design and art!)\n\nABOUT 2T's FIRST 10 STORIES\nOur first 10 stories start in the world established by the 1968 cult classic Night of the Living Dead, then we let our imaginations...and our zombies...run wild. \nMostly, our creators are telling new stories starring new characters. But if you love the classic film, you won't be disappointed; you can follow your favorite characters from the film, from their first appearances through their dying breaths, to their first baby zombie steps...\n\nTAKE A SNEAK PEEK AT OUR DIGITAL STORYBOARDS  BY CLICKING ON THE COVERS BELOW!\nComing soon!\nClick here to view our digital storyboard\nClick here to view our digital storyboard\n  Click here to view our digital storyboard\nClick here to view our digital storyboard\nClick here to view our digital storyboard\nComing soon!\nComing soon!\nComing soon!\nClick here to view our digital storyboard\nKICKSTARTER INSIDE LOOK INTO OUR FIRST STORIES!\nAs promised, to thank the first wave of backers, here is a special inside look into the first pages of Z-Men #1...\n\nInside Look 5/8/2015 into Z-Men #1: Nervous in the Service (credit page is not final!)\n\nWANT MORE?

All of us here at Double Take admire and respect the creators, cast and crew but no one affiliated with the Night of the Living Dead film is in any way involved in the creation of our stories. \nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\nQ: So why Night of the Living Dead?\nA: The film is the best thing in the public domain--we're all fans of the cult classic. Night of the Living Dead is also a great property for our Ultimate-approach to storytelling. \nQ: What makes the Ultimate Night of the Living Dead series different from heavyweights like The Walking Dead?\nA: Our Ultimate-style stories are told by The Moth Grand Slam winners and talented comic creators who really love the 1968 classic.\nQ: Who are the creative teams for these series?\nA: We have three star writers doing two books each: Jeff McComsey (best know for his Zombie collections, Fubar, Mother Russia) is on Z-Men and Rise. Brian Finkelstein and Peter Aguero our Moth Grand Slam champs are also doing two each. Brian's on Slab and Medic, Peter's on Home and Honor. Double Take is fortunate to have three wonderfully talented creators working in the office, Michael Coast, our Story Editor, along with Julian Rowe and Kurt Tiede \u2013 our graphic artists.\nQ: Why are you using Kickstarter?\nA: Kickstarter is a great way to reach out to readers directly, to learn about what you like and don't like. \nQ: What's the difference between the digital storyboards and the issue #1's in the Super Pack?\nA: Our digital storyboards are single-panel graphic storyboards that you can read and experience on the world's first native-mobile comic player. The digital storyboards are more art, but we abridged the dialogue. The Super Pack issues feature our best art in traditional comic page layouts, with more dialogue.\nQ: Are these going to be mini-series or ongoing titles?  \nA: These series will be ongoing until they go zombie. \nGOT MORE QUESTIONS?

But it's a story that I feel has facets that have not been explored fully. \"An innocent bystander with a difficult life is suddenly granted power beyond anything that they could have imagined!\" It's been done a million times. You've heard it, read it, and watched it on TV. Of course, Animal's \"innocent bystander\" is a dog.\nAnd he might not be the only one.\nMy goal when writing animal was to take a realistic approach to this scenario. Several of the major publishers have tried empowered animals, but I wanted to take it from a different angle. What happens when something that humanity has defined for years as an \"inferior\" creature to ourselves begins to grow beyond the box that has been defined for it?\nSpecifically, this Kickstarter will cover the first thirty strips of the comic, the first arc or volume. This will be the introduction and will serve as the basis for the continuing story. With this arc, you will meet all the major characters and get a feel for their motivations.\n\nWhat will it look like?\n\nAnimal will be illustrated as a comic strip by Artiom Zhukoff. It will be drawn entirely in black and white (With the exception of a color cover included with the hard copy) with Artiom's detail-heavy style. The realism and the heavy shadows of the art will, with any luck, add to the serious tone of the work. Lettering will be done by myself by hand.\nInked Cover\nPencils for Strip 1\n\nInks for Strip 1\n\nWhen will this happen?\nThe timeline for Animal is simple. If completely funded, the website that will host the comic, as well as the first strip and the \"thank you\" page, will be up within one month. Following that, new comic strips will be posted weekly for no less than thirty weeks. This is the duration of the webcomic that the crowdfunding will cover. With any luck, we will be self-sufficient by then, and will experience no hiccup before the posting of the thirty-first strip.\nAt that time, when that initial run is finished, backer rewards will go out, as the majority of them require the story to be complete! Get a better idea of what kind of rewards are available by checking them out on the side of the page, and see what might interest you. Additionally, below you can see a preview of the two shirts we're offering! When you select your size, you will select which style you prefer; hero or villain! Now, these are just mockups, so very minor changes might occur between now and when they are shipped, but nothing major will change on them.\n\nWho's to blame for this fiasco?\nAnimal was written by myself as my first foray into scripting comics. I've since worked on several more scripts, but this one holds a special place in my heart. I've never published a comic before. I've never published any of my writing (I've never even had the nerve to try). This will be a first for me on many levels... Be gentle.\nI am an Engineer from Mississippi by day, but I'm also a major comic book fan and have been reviewing titles for Comic Crusaders (Check out their website!) for several months now. My interest in writing comics came from the realization that not all of my stories could be told in prose. On any given weeknight (when I should be sleeping) I can be found scribbling ideas down into my notebook.\nMy page as an author can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/SullyWrites?ref=aymt_homepage_panel\nAnd my Twitter account can be found here: https://twitter.com/Sully_Writes\nThe art for Animal will be coming to you all the way from Russia. A man by the name of Artiom \"Artey\" Zhukoff will be lending his considerable talents to the project in order to bring my clumsy words to life on the page. Below, you can find the bio he prepared for this project.\n\"Im drawing for 5 years. I was learning drawing skills in the private studio of famous sculptor Micheal Mlokhotskiy, The Strogonov Academy, in private studio of Andrew Fedorovitch, Moscow Architect Institute where we draw nude model. Now I live in Smolensk and have my personal studio where I teach students drawing skills. In 2013 we found Moscow Art Studio, where I did video tutorials about comics and drawing materials and found pro digital artists from game design industry to give us lectures and master classes. My goal is bringing the art in peoples live, to help them decide what they want in their live, become the mentor for my students and help them found happiness as being artists. My goal in comics is to become as skilled as in pencils and inks as in digital way, make more connections with American writers and help them realize their dreams. My dream is visit Comicon.\"\nArtey's artist page can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/ZhukoffArtey?fref=ts\nAnd his Twitter account can be found here: https://twitter.com/Redde67\nMoscow Art Studio's Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/MoskovskaaStudiaRisunka\n\nHow will my contribution help?\nYour donations will be critical in helping ANIMAL to become a reality! At the moment, ANIMAL is a well formed idea, but it is still only that. The script is finalized. The concept art exists. But it needs the generous donations of you, the backer, to take shape and be enjoyed by anyone interested. The contributions will ensure that:\nThe first thirty strips of the webcomic can be illustrated by Artiom, The cover for the hardcopy can be professionally colored, The website to host the comic can be created and maintained, And the costs of the backer rewards can be covered!\nThe price that has been set, $2,750 dollars is designed to cover these things. Any over-funding will be put into having more print copies of ANIMAL produced for sale through the website or at conventions, hosting the website for a longer period of time, or future comic projects. I will not be taking any of the money raised for a \u201cwriter\u2019s fee\u201d or anything crazy like that. I am being rewarded enough just by being able to tell my story. A more comprehensive cost breakdown can be seen here, explaining how much of the funding goes into each category, roughly, by my estimates. The most variable of the categories is obviously the backer rewards. While the cost of each individual item has been taken into consideration and I have received quotes for all of them, the profit margin does vary slightly from reward to reward. In order to avoid potential pitfalls, this project\u2019s budget was formulated considering the least cost effective reward. The values seen below are rounded off (because nice, round numbers make me happy), but give a good idea of the portions of the project and their budget requirements.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nConsidering that the portion of the story that is being funded and promised for delivery is fully written and the illustration will be carried out by a full-time artist, risks for failure are minimal. Delays may be caused by a number of reasons, but for each potential pitfall I have been able to foresee, I have tried to come up with a contingency plan. \n\nWebsite: The most likely reason for delay could come from the creation of the website. I'm going to be honest and tell you I have little experience in this area, so it could cause problems when setting things up in the first month. However, I have contacts who have created and managed websites in the past so solutions should only be a phone-call or a Skype message away. \n\nArt: In the extremely unlikely event that that the project finds itself without an artist for whatever extenuating reason, a replacement will be found ASAP. \n\nRewards: Physical rewards could experience a delay in delivery due to production times, shipping complications, or potentially due to myself traveling with my primary job.

And as far as printing goes, we are in contact with our printer and are ready to send off the print files as soon as we are backed.\n\nAs for the second RISK, we believe the ONLY CHALLENGE that stands before us is marketing and promotion of the Kickstarter for SOUL MEN #1.

Lore hunting has become a near extinct profession known only by pirates and immortals. Together, they seek the silver scroll, known to contain the secrets to glitch magic and said to be coveted by Qigong Master Zee.\nIt was said that Xven would learn of glitch mastery with the appeaence of the astral spider, as it weaved the web delicately through the Towers of Ouoranth...\nXven falling after searing a planet with glitch arts\n  TRETA-YUGA, YUGAVERSE, and all content \u00a9 2014 Benton Rooks\nXven close up concept art\nBut Master Zee's faithful adepts may only learn to know of the infamous document through the transmission of the Shadow Tiger stance, a rare Qigong form which allows a proper gateway into Innerspace itself.\nTRETA-YUGA is an innovative, action packed, science-fantasy graphic novel that utilizes digital lighting techniques to achieve a cinematic, photo-realistic aesthetic. It is inspired by Eastern mythology, the Wuxia genre, JRPG's, anime, and game/film concept art.\n\nInterviews/Press/Links\n\nA video interview I did with legendary UK author Graham Hancock received quite a lot of attention.\nCheck out an in depth interview on inspiration and background for the YUGAVERSE here.\n\nTake a listen to a podcast I did with indie Kickstarter Comic masters The Wombmates here.\n\nMy article Japanese Media, Psychedelic Yokai, and Graphic Novels traces some of the Eastern lore that has inspired TRETA-YUGA.\n\nRead the Sequart review of the previous Kickstarter success KALI-YUGA by David Whittaker here.\nReaders should also know that due to some truly awesome friends and fans, some of my previous articles at Reality Sandwich have received over 8,000+ shares.\n\nThis project will be tweeted to over 8,000 followers on my own Twitter accounts @bentonrooks, @KaliYugaComic and on Facebook.\n\nYour support will be shared to a global fan base and will be appreciated widely!\nDetails\n\nThe \"rules\" of this graphic novel are: no speech bubbles, no sound effect text, and each image will conform (with a few exceptions) to the widescreen cinematic format. I love traditional 2D comic art, but I thought it'd be fun and challenging to try a \"film on paper\" approach.\nDimensions of the final product in printed form will be horizontal in format rather than the standard vertical comic, similar to the concept art book for Dune (as seen in Jodorowsky's Dune documentary.)\nCritical acclaim for the YUGAVERSE:\n\n\"With the creation of the YUGAVERSE, Benton Rooks has created something that is gorgeous to behold on the visual level, while also being distinctly forward thinking in experimental aesthetics. This epic story is a must read for fans of fantasy and sci-fi alike. \u2014Graham Hancock, bestselling author of Fingerprints of the Gods, and the War God trilogy \n\"This is exactly what needs to happen. Really smart authors and artists with visions need to engage the technical scholarship on the gnostic, esoteric, and mystical in order to help create a new emergent mythology, a new world, a new planetary future. It comes as no surprise that Benton Rooks is engaging in this magic ritual of the YUGAVERSE in the only public space where it is now allowed: in the secret gnosis of popular culture.\" \u2014Jeffrey J. Kripal, author of Mutants and Mystics: Science Fiction, Superhero Comics, and the Paranormal\n\n\"Benton's fresh anti-Gandalf take on the wizard archetype merges sci-fi and fantasy themes for an action packed, psychedelic romp through dark, interdimensional reptile lairs.

The story art gorgeously illustrated  by FABRIZIO FIORENTINO, whom we collaborated with on ALL STAR WESTERN and this is complimented by the lush digital painting of  ALESSIA NOCERA. Also featured is a dynamic and beautiful cover by award winning illustrator TIM BRADSTREET , with special reward catagories featuring a special limited edition mystery cover by multiple Eisner and Shuster Award winner DARWYN COOKE and another special cover by award winning and fan favorite artist  AMANDA CONNER. We are happy to also announce our new partnership with  the awesome crew at ADAPTIVE  STUDIOS . \nThis entire square bound SOFTCOVER book will be a total of 72 pages plus material printed on the best paper stock available and printed in the USA. We need to raise the amount featured to cover production handling and distribution costs involved in producing an original graphic novel this big and beautiful. \nThe inspiration for this project comes from our love of mature westerns, murder mysteries and the horror genre as well as the original unpublished screenplay it is based on. This was a project we fell in love with immediately. \n\nTHE STORY:\n\n\u201cIn the distance the silhouette of a sprawling boomtown rises ominously from the earth like a gravestone risen from Hell.\u201d\n  Set in the late 1880\u2019s American West, Abbadon is a city steeped in sin, where anything is possible if you have the money, influence and power to obtain it. Poised to become the next boomtown, Abbadon is plagued by a series of murders heralding the arrival of U.S. Marshall Wes Garrett. A legendary lawman, Garrett\u2019s claim to fame is that he killed a notorious murderer, who cut a bloody swath across the country and left scores of mutilated men, women and children in his wake. Garrett\u2019s arrival exposes the secret that Abbadon\u2019s sheriff Colt Dixon has desperately been trying to conceal \u2013 the victims have all been mutilated the same way they were by the killer Garret stopped \u2013 a man some called a monster, but the papers called him Bloody Bill. Garrett and Dixon join forces to uncover the killer\u2019s identity in a town so full of corruption that everyone is a suspect.

Enticing them with compensation helps, like food or gas money, but they are volunteering time which as we all know is invaluable because it is limited. We HOPE to get this thing in the can by the end of summer 2014 but life does happen. Regardless, it WILL get done, as we have proved that we can finish what we start, even if we have to rewrite or recast. Check out Dirigible Days or any one of our other masterpieces at day304.com. We also have to get through this Kickstarter, which is anxiety overload! Will we make it?!\n\nThe risk is that no one will like our series. So far, we put hours upon hours of time and our own hard-earned monies, our love and OTHER people's time and monies into something--for it to get bad reviews and attract trolls and it will never go anywhere, or amount to anything. It's scary for any artist, but that is the risk we take when we put our souls out for the world to see.

All of this is brought to you by the PAPERFILMS team that has delivered QUEEN CRAB, FORAGER, WEAPON OF GOD, RETROVIRUS, and SEX AND VIOLENCE. \nWe are very proud of our track record with past Kickstarters, and we know you will be happy with this one as well. With this project we added a really cool feature: a soundtrack! Read on\u2026\nWrap around cover by Pier Brito\nPREMISE: After a rogue meteor impacts our moon, forcing it off its regular orbit, the oceans rise dramatically, consuming most of the planet\u2019s surface. The United States is under water, with the exception of its last major metropolis: Denver, Colorado. This is not the horrible post-apocalypse world we are used to. It is a showcase of mankind\u2019s greatest achievements and ability to survive, but as always, there needs to be control and regulation in a city that can only house and feed a specific number of citizens. There are those outside this great city who would do just about anything to get in. That is where our main character MAX FLYNN comes in.\nMax is one of many armed Coast Border Guards [CBG] who protects and processes everything coming into and leaving DENVER. He lives with his new wife, Betty, and his teenage daughter from a previous marriage, Trinity. On the job, Max has command of his two partners, Jimmy DePaul and Jane Nelson. Their job is to route everything and everyone that enters the city from the waterways, inclusive of new citizens seeking refuge in DENVER. In this futuristic world, masses of people are wandering the earth\u2019s waterways in hopes of gaining admission to some of the few cities left, and DENVER is no different. They keep a constant population count by monitoring every time a citizen of DENVER dies; an open space is available for either a birth or granting an outsider citizenship in DENVER. This person would have to be sponsored by an active resident.\nUnfortunately there are those who would do just about anything to gain entry into DENVER. The burden of stopping this falls upon Max and the CBG. Our story is about a group that goes to such extremes, and Max is forced to go against everything he has ever learned and been trained for.\nDENVER is a story about extortion, betrayal, and the lengths a person will go to, to protect the ones they love. DENVER was born out of a love for adult sci-fi stories, drawing its inspiration from films like BLADE RUNNER, SOYLENT GREEN, and ROAD WARRIOR, and a lifetime of reading HEAVY METAL MAGAZINE\u2014as well as being brought up having hope in mankind.\n             THE SOUNDTRACK : \nThe soundtrack. Yes, we have added an actual soundtrack to complete the experience of the graphic novel, written and composed by Hans Karl. A sample runs with the video above and this soundtrack was written based on the Denver graphic novel.\nTo listen to a track from the Denver soundtrack, go to: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdEpiQGfd7w\n Hans Karl is a film and multimedia composer.

You can find out more about Hans at his website:  http://www.hanskarlmusic.com\n Also featured on the soundtrack is the ending credit song: \u201c You Do\u201d, written and performed by Carrie Johnson.

As the days pass, Ellie alarmingly slips in and out of a catatonic state for short periods of time, each time explaining that the angels are getting closer. Are the angels real? Is Ellie suffering a mental breakdown or are we about to make first contact with an alien intelligence? \nThe inspiration for FORAGER was born out of frustration with mainstream science fiction movies where nearly all alien life in the universe wants to conquer or eat us. There is very little optimism, hope or joy. So FORAGER draws its inspiration films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET and Starman.

Thank you for making this happen!\nThe LAST STRETCH GOAL of 35k is will provide the OVER-SIZED HARD COVER previously at the 40k level.

So let's see if we can stretch one last time!\nEXTREME LEVEL - Stretch Goal #3 - $35,000 level - Exclusive DELUXE BRIGADE OVER-SIZED HARDCOVER! I love hardcovers and I want this one to be over-sized, bigger than the standard issue hard covers. If you have pledged for the hardcover edition, it will AUTOMATICALLY be Super-sized AT NO EXTRA COST. But in order to make that a reality, we have to super-size our goal and reach this stretch initiative!\nFinal Week Upgrades Galore! Everyone at the $25 , $30, $50 and $100 levels! Signed Marvel comics at the $25 level, Signed Deadpool comics at $30 and multiple Marvel and Deadpool comics at $50 and above.\nEveryone at the $25 reward level receives an additional Extreme comic signed by Rob Liefeld.

Let's Stretch this out and create more GREAT REWARDS!!\nBRIGADE adds BESTSELLING AUTHOR to the mix!\nI'm pleased to announce that Bestselling sci-fi and TV scribe Mat Nastos is joining BRIGADE! Mat brings his unique voice and considerable talent to BRIGADE as co-writer and scripter!\nVeteran writer and Amazon Bestselling author, Mat Nastos has been a film/tv artist, director and writer since the early 1990\u2032s. His work has been published by Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Warp Graphics, Playboy and Highlights for Kids, and has been seen everywhere from the SyFy Channel to Cinemax, Starz and the Disney Channel.

Look for big, dramatic conflict and action as we combine our efforts on BRIGADE!\n\nBRIGADE FOR FREE! Stretch Goals!\nWe have reached the Stretch Goals Phase of FREE BRIGADE! \nWhere does the money go?\n100% of the funding is going to PRINTING the comic and the hardcover. My personal goal is to produce at least 100,000 copies of BRIGADE #1 or 50,000 each of issues #1 and #2. That is the purpose of this Kickstarter. I draw every day wether I'm paid or not, it's what I do, but printing comics and giving them away for FREE must be budgeted and accounted for.\nSTRETCH GOALS!\nThank you to everyone who has supported and pledged to get us funded. What does this mean? It means I can provide 50,000 FREE BRIGADE copies to fans and retailers! I would like to increase that number and expand the amount of FREE BRIGADE comic books! With that in mind I've created fun, creative Stretch Goals incentives to reach the next stage! \nTHE PROJECT\nBRIGADE and its creator Rob Liefeld ( Deadpool, Cable, X-Force ) are returning to comics and we want everyone to get a FREE copy of the re-imagined Brigade! Brigade launched in the summer of 1992 and was one of the most popular books at Image Comics. The book featured a colorful cast of characters, Battlestone, Coldsnap, Lethal, Seahawk, Thermal, Stasis and Roman united against the forces of evil. The cast and concept of Brigade have been radically updated and re-imagined and I'd like everyone to get a copy for free! I can only do this with your support and commitments on Kickstarter. Last year, Top Cow productions successfully re-launched Cyber Force with this Free Initiative, inspiring this\nBy funding this Free Initiative you are helping provide Free copies of Brigade to comic stores in the U.S. and Canada as well as Free digital downloads of Brigade. The more money raised, the more FREE copies and issues we can produce. A FREE comic breaks through all barriers and crosses all ages, a free comic provides a risk-free experience that can create a doorway into a new world of imagination and wonder. Brigade with its fresh, bold direction and characters will provide a dynamic comic book experience for readers old and new.\nWHAT'S IT ABOUT?\nThe premise behind the new Brigade is that all time and space is under constant attack by a multitude of threats each attempting to alter the course of human history. A Brigade of heroes is assembled by John Stone aka Battlestone who commands a diverse unit of heroes uniquely qualified to defend humanity and preserve the fragile order of things. By definition, \"A Brigade is a major tactical military formation that is typically composed of up to three to six battalions\". The first of many TIME-BOMB'S has been detonated and the fabric of many realities has begun to crater and change.\nBattlestone has gone to great lengths to recruit a dynamic new team to facilitate the variety of threats that his units will encounter in defense of humanity. A powerful nemesis known as IMPERATOR has emerged as a force of cataclysmic terror and devastation, although his true identity, while suspect is not confirmed.\nKNIGHTMARE! CYBRID! LETHAL! FREE AGENT! SOLDIER! KABOOM! SHOGUN! are but a few of the vast and diverse cast that assembles to combat a myriad of threats against the fabric of our reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe amount of available FREE Brigade issues will be based on the results of this kickstarter campaign. The current pledge amount assures that the first two Brigade issues will be available free. Additional issues will be added as funds are appropriated. \n\nFulfillment will be finalized once all available products are received from the printer.
