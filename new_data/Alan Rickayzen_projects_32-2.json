[{"backer": "Alan Rickayzen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Tens of thousands already use Luna Display for Mac and now we\u2019re bringing that same magic to Windows. Whether you\u2019re working remotely, looking to maximize your workspace, or seeking more creative flexibility - Luna has you covered. As the only hardware solution on the market, you can...\nTurn any iPad into a wireless second display for your PC or Mac\nConnect via WiFi or USB \nExperience lag-free lightning-fast speeds\nUse any Windows or Mac app\nUtilize full touch support and external keyboard support \nChoose from two unit options for PC: USB-C or HDMI\n\nMore people than ever are working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We're a fully-remote company ourselves \u2014 and have been since we started 7 years ago \u2014 so we truly understand the struggles of working remotely. That\u2019s why we built Luna Display!\nLife is better when your workflow works\u2014 \nNot enough screen space to work efficiently? Luna acts as a second display, so you can extend your workspace from your desktop to iPad.\nTraditional monitors leave you tethered to your desk. But Luna works wirelessly over your existing WiFi network \u2014 so you can move your workspace around your house, to the office, and everywhere in between. \nMobile second screen setups are often complex to set up and require lots of wires and tools. With Luna, you can pair a Windows or Mac computer to an iPad with just some apps and your Luna. No need to buy new screens - make the most out of what you have.\n\n\n\n\nLuna works with any Mac or Windows desktop application \u2014  \n\nLuna gives you the flexibility to work wherever you want, however you want. Whether it\u2019s stepping away from the confines of your desk to working from anywhere within your home, you can create the ultimate wireless setup with minimal effort. \nLuna will connect as long as both devices are on the same WiFi network. You can even take your workflow outdoors with a strong WiFi connection.\n\nWe've spent years building Luna\u2019s custom video compression technology we call LIQUID. Every line of LIQUID code was originally written to meet the demands of pro artists, and the result is stunning image quality and responsiveness. That means Luna can keep up with any heavy-duty workflow.\n\nUnlike our competitors, Luna\u2019s custom-engineering guarantees consistent performance across all of your favorite PC programs. Enjoy the same reliability of a traditional monitor but the flexibility of your iPad. \n\n\nTake your mobile workspace on the go without worrying about a bunch of cords or heavy clip-on screens. Just pack your laptop, iPad, and Luna and you\u2019re ready to go! \nLuna\u2019s hardware dongle is discreet, compact, and beautifully designed. Unlike other bulky tech accessories that take up space, Luna fits neatly in the compact box that it\u2019s sent in.\nEach box contains a Luna dongle, sculpted foam packing to safely hold it in place, and a simple card with instructions to help you get set up in seconds.\n\n\nLuna Display for Windows is available in two port types \u2014 USB-C or HDMI. \nIf you\u2019re a Mac user, Luna is available in USB-C or Mini DisplayPort (available for immediate purchase at lunadisplay.com). The USB-C version is compatible with both PC and Mac. \nYour purchase includes the Luna Display hardware unit along with access to the free Luna Display desktop and iPad apps.  \nNOTE: Luna for Mac is available in both mDP and USB-C. However, Luna USB-C for Mac will only contain Windows support after the Kickstarter. If you choose to purchase Luna USB-C through our Kickstarter, you'll receive special Kickstarter discounts and support our Windows effort.  \n\n\nTens of thousands of happy Mac users have already transformed their workflows with Luna Display. Here\u2019s what they have to say \u2014\n\u201cReally enjoying my new set up, thanks to Luna Display! Such a great tool to expand workflows. \ud83d\ude4c\u201d  \u2014Travis V.\n\u201cGenuinely blown away by how well it works. Never thought I\u2019d ever be able to use a desktop computer whilst laying on the sofa. Thanks Luna Display!\u201d \u2014Alastair M.\n\"This little device from Luna Display is incredible! It allows me to use an iPad as a second screen wirelessly with retina resolution. 2 min out of the box and up and running. \ud83d\udc4d\u201d  \u2014Shane D.\n\u201cMuch needed second screen for my 13\u201dMBP when not at my desk. Big workflow gain. Works great over WiFi or tethered USB.\u201d \u2014David T.\n\u201cI just got my Luna Display in the mail, and it's incredible. Truly feels like the iPad Pro is just another monitor.\u201d \u2014Zack K.\n\u201cReally happy with my LunaDisplay. I use it constantly when I travel. Such a beautifully engineered solution, a real \u201cIt just works\u201d piece of kit.\u201d \u2014Harrison T. \n\u201cThis device is such a game changer for me. For somebody that works offsite and needs more screen real estate in apps like After Effects, Luna Display knocks it out of the park. And there\u2019s little to no lag because it works off a solid WiFi connection. Highly recommend!!\u201d \u2014Miles F.\n\u201cI can take my iPad and the mouse to another part of a room and control the Mac - perfect for home recording / microphone chamber. Luna Display is great!\u201d \u2014Hannes O.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried almost all of the \u2018use your iPad as a second display\u2019 options and the ONLY one that legitimately delivered on the promise is Luna Display \u2013 thank you for making this!\u201d \u2014Stephen S.\n\u201cStill can\u2019t believe how solid Luna has been day to day. Literally feels like I\u2019m using a retina touch screen Mac when it\u2019s open.\u201d \u2014Daniel P.\n\u201cJust set up my Luna Display! I don't remember the last time I've ever been so excited about a piece of tech. My two screens and I thank you.\u201d  \u2014Lauren B.\n\u201cThe speed and resolution are head and shoulders over software-only solutions!\u201d \u2014Martin L. \n\nSimply plug in Luna, launch the apps, and your devices will automatically connect! Luna for Windows is available for USB-C or HDMI.\n\nPlug Luna into your Windows computer. (You do not need to plug in a Luna into your iPad!)\nLaunch the respective Luna Display apps on your Windows computer and your iPad. \nNow you're up and running! \n\n\nWith full support for external keyboards, Apple Pencil, and touch interactions, Luna allows you to harness the power of your PC while extending your display to the iPad.

We\u2019re launching Astropad for Windows next year.\n\nAstropad offers complete workflow customization, featuring a packed suite full of creatives tools like unlimited workflow shortcuts, Magic Gestures, and custom pressure curves. Pairing Luna with Astropad gives professional creatives the freedom and flexibility that their workflow deserves.\nCount on your fingers to give you a hand! You don\u2019t have to go to Hogwarts to use Magic Gestures. Save room in the sidebar by assigning frequently-used shortcuts to finger-touch and tap interactions.\nPut the pressure on, or take the pressure off! Whichever way you lean, we\u2019ve got you covered. If the automatic pressure sensitivity of the Apple Pencil doesn\u2019t work for you, no sweat! Customize the pressure curve to your individual drawing preferences.\nThe curve settings in Studio helps you preview your adjustments, so you can better understand the changes you\u2019re making. Test the curve\u2019s pressure sensitivities at any time by pressing anywhere on your screen outside of the sidebar while the Pressure Curve settings are open.\nWho said taking shortcuts has to be a bad thing? No matter what your workload might look like, we\u2019ll keep up with you. Set up your perfect workflow and tool alignment just once, so you can come back to your perfectly-organized, on-screen desk every time. Free up your time and self to creativity!\nShortcuts automatically adjust when you switch apps, too. Even if you haven\u2019t already established shortcuts for an app, the Studio shortcut sidebar comes equipped with the most common tools in each app to get you started!\n\n\nWe\u2019re a small but mighty team of problem-solvers, creatives, engineers, and dreamers. \nAstropad was founded in 2013 by two former Apple engineers, Matt Ronge and Giovanni Donelli. Today, we\u2019re a nimble crew of 16 people. Within our tiny powerhouse, we have a Windows-focused engineering team; a Luna hardware and firmware team; and a dedicated team of technical support experts. \nWe\u2019ve always been a fully-remote company, with team members located around the world. Because of this, we\u2019ve made it our mission to build products that make life easier for other creative people that work remote. \nWe\u2019re a 100% bootstrapped company. We\u2019ve never taken outside investment, which is why we rely on communities like Kickstarter to help bring our products to life. \nPLAY\n\n A look at our prototypes:\nHere's a demo of the prototype hardware we used to shoot our main video:\nPLAY\n\n\n\nWe are looking for your support through Kickstarter to help us pay for our next large-scale manufacturing round. Here\u2019s what Luna\u2019s development timeline looks like:\nWe originally launched Luna Display for Mac on Kickstarter in 2017. Our campaign was wildly successful, raising over $645K \u2014 2,100% more than our original funding goal!\nNow we\u2019re back and ready to bring Luna Display to Windows. And this time around, we\u2019ve streamlined every aspect of Luna\u2019s production, so we can ship to you as soon as possible:\n\u2014 Strengthened relationship with our manufacturing partner \nOver the past few years, we\u2019ve cultivated a loyal and transparent relationship with our manufacturing partner in China. Before the pandemic, our cofounder Giovanni was taking quarterly trips to our factory to assess assembly processes and product quality. Over these many trips, we\u2019ve built a strong partnership with our Chinese team, and they are excited to come on this journey with us to launch Luna to the Windows market! \n\u2014 Scaled up distribution to accommodate more volume and countries\nOur distribution center in Atlanta, Georgia has scaled up to accommodate increased volume with our new Windows market. And since our last Kickstarter, we\u2019ve expanded our shipping capabilities to over 55 countries around the world. Our shipping timelines have been on-time and on-track, with few impacts since the pandemic hit. \n\u2014 Tripled the size of our Technical Support Team\nIn preparation for the Windows community, we\u2019ve tripled the size of our Technical Support Team. Timely and thorough responses are our top priority, as well as fully understanding our exciting new customer base. Our Support Team also works hand-in-hand with our Engineering Team for troubleshooting and providing immediate product feedback.  \n\u2014 Hired a team of dedicated Windows engineers\nTo build the best product experience possible, we hired a team of talented software engineers that are dedicated to Windows compatibility. As we launch Luna for Windows, our engineering team is standing by to fix bugs and launch new product features!\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u2014 Developing cross-platform technology \nWe knew that building Luna Display for Windows would be an uphill battle. Like all of our products, we started from scratch. This meant learning an entirely new coding language and rebuilding our core Liquid technology to be faster, more durable, and work smoothly on Windows. We also hired a new team of Windows developers to help us ramp up development.\n\n\u2014 Getting to know the Windows community \nIn our cross-platform journey, we\u2019ve had to admit that we\u2019re in new territory, which means understanding a new audience. As we make strides in delivering on our Windows promise, we\u2019re dedicated to making our products better than ever. To better understand our new Windows audience, we\u2019ll be conducting ongoing market research about how our users like to be productive with Luna Display. \n\n\u2014 Production during a global pandemic \nNow that we\u2019re approaching the finish line, we\u2019re cognizant of the risks of production during the COVID-19 pandemic. It\u2019s our goal to ship Luna Display for Windows on-time, but the health and safety of the employees producing our USB-C and HDMI units is critical.

Using its new and improved sensors, Arsenal 2 fine tunes your camera's settings by analyzing 22 different environmental factors. The result is great settings for any shot.  \nArsenal 2\u2019s Deep Color uses a neural network to intelligently develop each photo. Deep Color is not a look or a filter. Instead, it produces a set of adjustments custom to each photo. The results are balanced yet powerful, rendering bold images that flatter every photo without being over the top. See the difference below compared to a camera's built-in colors. \nSee our \u201cHow it works\u201d section below for more details.\nArsenal 2 controls your camera over USB and automates some of the most powerful photography techniques. The onboard GPU automatically stacks photos and sends them to your phone\u2014or saves them to Arsenal 2\u2019s micro SD card slot (See FAQ for details). \nNight photography is notoriously difficult. Arsenal 2\u2019s Night Assist makes it easy. It can focus on the stars with a tap*, then calculate the perfect settings to get sharp, detailed night photos.\n*Night focus times vary by camera and lens. Night focus normally requires between 30 seconds and 2 minutes to get stars in perfect focus. See the FAQ for lens compatibility.\nPanoramas make for powerful photos, but there\u2019s too much guessing involved. With Arsenal 2\u2019s live panorama, you can be sure you didn\u2019t miss anything. The Arsenal Phone Mount accessory (sold separately) holds Arsenal 2 and your phone, so you can watch the panorama build as you shoot. When you\u2019re done, crop the final output and it's ready to share.\nIn some locations, there will always be someone in your photo. By combining multiple shots, Arsenal 2\u2019s new Crowd Control feature can automatically remove people and other moving objects from your photos.\nArsenal 2 ships in Standard and Pro versions. Both have the same software features (and support the same cameras), but Arsenal 2 Pro brings even more performance improvements, added weather resistance, and USB-C connectivity. \n*Micro SD card sold separately, see the \"Accessories\" section below\n\nArsenal 2 automates advanced photo stacking techniques to help you capture scenes with High Dynamic Range (HDR). In seconds, Arsenal 2 takes multiple exposures and blends them into a single shot capturing details in both bright and dark areas of the scene.\nWith Arsenal 2, you can create long exposures that capture rich color and dramatic motion blurs...without buying expensive neutral density filters.\nWith focus stacking, you can get your entire scene in sharp focus. Arsenal 2 calculates the ideal aperture, takes shots at different focus positions, and merges them into one crystal clear image.\nWe love timelapses, so we spent five years designing the ultimate timelapse tool. Start your timelapse with a tap...or set custom parameters. Arsenal 2 will intelligently manage the exposure to create a smooth day-to-night transition. You can even preview your timelapse while it\u2019s being recorded. You (and your phone) can leave. Come back any time to change settings or check progress. Arsenal 2 takes care of the rest. \nArsenal 2's powerful new processors allow for faster intervals, smoother transitions, and higher quality previews.\nCheck out some of our timelapses shot with Arsenal 2.\n\nArsenal 2 lets you control your camera from up to 100 feet away. Tap to focus, set shutter speed, aperture, and ISO; see a live preview; and take the shot\u2014all from your phone.\nSharing photos from your DSLR or mirrorless camera shouldn\u2019t be hard. Use Arsenal 2 to automatically sync full-resolution photos to your phone, or send individual photos to your favorite apps with a tap.\nCheck out our Deep Color gallery for more examples.\nArsenal 2 supports over 100 popular DSLR and mirrorless camera models, 23 of which are new for Arsenal 2. \nClick here to view all supported cameras\nArsenal 2 controls your camera via a USB cable (included), and you control Arsenal 2 wirelessly from your phone. Arsenal 2\u2019s free mobile app is compatible with modern iOS and Android devices. \n Arsenal 2 Pro works with all of the same cameras as Arsenal 2 Standard. \nHi, my name is Ryan. I\u2019m a software developer, photographer, and the creator of Arsenal. I love learning. Photography let me learn something new and experience more of the beauty we have here in Montana. Arsenal started as a way to improve my own photography.\nWhen I launched the original Arsenal campaign on Kickstarter, there was more demand that I ever expected. During the campaign, I was fortunate to be able to hire some of the smartest and most talented people I know. Three years on, we're still a small team.

After our first campaign we delivered over 100,000 Arsenals to our backers across the globe. And along the way we built up tools, relationships, and expertise that will help us to deliver Arsenal 2. \n\nFrom a technology standpoint, much of the work that went into Arsenal 1 can be reused as a foundation for Arsenal 2 (both Standard and Pro). A lot of the work required to get Arsenal 1 out the door wasn\u2019t feature specific, but involved things like camera integration, mobile app communication and deployment, firmware management, user interface design, bug tracking, etc. Having that foundation means we can spend more time optimizing performance and testing features. \n\nFor Arsenal 2, we\u2019ve completed all of the hardware development, and our manufacturing partners are already established and ready to go to production once parts are in. We\u2019ve also expanded our Support team, hired a Logistics Manager, and upgraded our fulfillment partners so that shipping is quick and easy. \n\nEven with all of the planning we\u2019ve done, issues always come up.

When possessions or our dear pets go missing, the usual solutions just aren't good enough. \nThat's why we created The AirBolt\u00ae GPS, a tracker perfect for every situation.\n\nWe're human; we misplace things; we have no idea how the keys got left in the fridge or where the cat has been all night. So, after a stressful night of searching for the cat and catching the bus the next morning because we couldn't find our keys, we knew something had to change.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we came up with is The AirBolt\u00ae GPS. This tracker is perfect. It's small, only 37mm x 34mm x 11mm (1.45\" x 1.34\" x 0.43\") and VERY lightweight (approx. 21 grams, 0.75oz). This means it can be hung from a collar or slipped discreetly in a pocket or bag. Since we knew Bluetooth wouldn't cut it, we decided we needed to use GPS.  \nWe took our tracking to the next level, however, by implementing location over LTE-M / NB-IoT, which are next-generation low-powered cellular networks. This way we would have the perfect balance of indoor, outdoor and nearby tracking. We then decided on an ever-growing network so we could track belongings globally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Gen 3 Onward\n\n\nWe are so proud of what The AirBolt\u00ae GPS can do. There are so many uses for every lifestyle that owning one just won't do!\nThe AirBolt\u00ae uses LTE-M/NB-IoT & GPS with the capability to provide quick and accurate location updates on demand.  Our tracking range is global and the list of covered countries is growing rapidly! Nearby tracking is also possible without subscription access, so you are never locked into subscriptions if you don\u2019t want one!\n\n\nLosing a pet is terrifying, so we designed the AirBolt\u00ae GPS to make lost pets a thing of the past. Track them anywhere, keep them safe and put your mind at ease. Set up Geo-Fencing and Separation Alerts, so you will immediately know if they have left the vicinity. The alert button can send you a message if someone else finds your pet.\n\nUse AirBolt\u00ae GPS on a child's backpack. Perfect for when they start walking to school themselves, keeping track of sports bags, or locating school items that are missing or forgotten. Check the tracker at school pickup and see if they've left their library bag behind. \n\n\n\nNot a morning person? Don't worry about leaving your bag on the train, track your items and set a proximity alarm to alert you if you move away from your belongings.\n\nYou can even share access with your family, friends, colleagues or employees. Everyone can keep track of their own belongings.  This is also a great safety feature when travelling alone - share your location with friends and family so they know you\u2019re safe!\n\nTrack your equipment, gear or even drones with our small, and VERY lightweight device. The AirBolt\u00aeGPS is designed to be versatile and fit all your hobbies.\n\nNature lover? The AirBolt\u00ae GPS is waterproof up to 1m (for 30minutes) with a built-in alert to let you know when it has been submerged.  Give access to your AirBolt\u00ae GPS and allow friends and family to know where you are surfing, skiing, hiking or camping.\n\nWorried about your vehicles, tools or work equipment? The discrete size means you can place The AirBolt\u00ae GPS in your heavy vehicle, boat, trailer or toolbox without worry. \nMonitor when your equipment is being used or borrowed and where it's going. Put one in your glovebox to remember where you parked. Place it inside expensive equipment cases. You can even set up a proximity alarm and geo-fence to alert you if something leaves your worksite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have made the conscious decision to calculate and charge shipping closer to the time of shipping the units themselves. Given the current environment and lack of global flights, the pricing is significantly higher than what it should be down the track. Hence, delaying shipping charges can result in cost savings to our backers.\nBelow are our estimates for shipping costs:\n\nIn order to create great design, you have to have a great team. Meet the team at AirBolt, we\u2019ve got some of the sharpest entrepreneurial minds in Australia and abroad. We work hard to bring you cutting edge products using world-class materials. Our Good Design Award Winning Team is proud to be designing and creating in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\nFrom start to finish, we aim to create a strong, durable and beautifully-designed product. Every step of the way, we create, design, and refine to release a truly smart accessory. We don\u2019t stop after release either, our team is constantly updating, and upgrading our software and interfaces so you always get the best service and latest functionality.\nOur timeline from start to finish can be viewed below. We estimate shipping to our backers by December 2020. With the current international timeline, this estimate can change but we will keep updating if there are any changes to our supply chain.\nGiven we have unlocked our stretch goal. You will now be able to control, manage, share and view location (and location history) of the AirBolt GPS via a Web Platform too .\n Along with this, you can locate your devices via Watch OS now too!\n\nAirBolt\u00ae GPS is a very small, very secure, very energy efficient and a powerful device. Our GPS is on a rapidly expanding global network so you really can accurately track whatever you need to keep an eye on.\nWe don\u2019t impose travel time limits like some others.  The AirBolt GPS, can be used for as long as you like across any part of our coverage network (see FAQ for current coverage details).\nTo access this global network, we are offering our backers a significantly reduced  subscription rate @ 50% off!\nThese rates will apply per device to each unit that you purchase through this campaign only. Oh and if you gift it to someone, don't worry we will even extend the discount to them for that device!\nWe made our subscription extremely affordable. Kickstarter Special Price @ $4.99 USD p/mth per device with international coverage (normal retail estimate is $10 USD p/month). That's just the price of a large coffee a month! \nA subscription isn't mandatory.  Our tracker is equipped with Bluetooth for nearby tracking and for using proximity alerts. It does not require a subscription for this.\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nThis project's PR is handled by SlicedBrand, a leading global PR firm that has led many crowdfunding campaigns to success", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks:\nWhen it comes to managing risks, we know the game. Unlike a lot of crowdfunding campaigns, not only are we well advanced with product development, this isn\u2019t our first rodeo.\n\nWe understand the time and commitment required to develop the perfect product. Our aim is to be known for being best in class, and that is what we work day and night to deliver. We have been in the game for over five years now, have the relationships and teams in place to ensure that we can deliver to you, our wonderful backers, in time. \n\nWe do understand that we are now living in a COVID climate. With our previous experience with Kickstarter campaigns, we know that manufacturing and logistical timelines can rapidly change. We are taking great care in our manufacturing timeline and are allowing a more extended time-frame from manufacturing to backer fulfillment. \n\nWe are incredibly confident that we can meet our delivery and quality promise, and we pledge for complete transparency in this campaign, so our backers are confident in us and our products.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWhen designing The AirBolt\u00ae GPS, we have chosen to use best in class components. We evaluated a large range of internal components and ensured that the ones we selected to build The AirBolt\u00ae GPS, can stand the test of time. We know what it takes to make lasting products; for example, our 1st Generation Travel Locks are still widely used five years on. We also continue to provide FREE Over-the-Air (OTA) software updates to our customers ensuring that our products provide the latest and greatest at all times. Our drive to ensure that we can deliver the best does increase our manufacturing costs, but we genuinely believe in the customer experience (which makes it worth it).\n\nFurthermore, The AirBolt\u00ae GPS \n- Is waterproof up to 1m, making it the perfect tracker for all weather and all location tracking\n- Is a discrete size\n- Has a rugged body meaning our GPS has a higher tolerance for normal wear and tear and will last longer than competing products.\nSustainable materials\nWe aim to have The AirBolt\u00ae GPS become a must-have item for everyone. Therefore, our device needs to work globally. The more versatile the product, the less the need to create unnecessary variations and the less wastage too; hence, we spared no expense partnering with the best-in-class to provide coverage which is second to none.\n\nWe have also meticulously chosen components which are designed to last. The battery for example is rechargeable and typically has a life-cycle of 500 charges, meaning it will last for years. We have even ensured we have over-charge protection with auto-resetting fuses. Every bit towards ensuring longevity is a part of our culture.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe have spent years building sustainable fulfilment partnerships and have multiple global fulfilment options available to us at all times.\n\nWe have made a conscious decision to calculate and charge shipping closer to the time of shipping the units themselves.

For the last 3 and a half years, the Mooltipass Team has been working on what we're convinced is the best balance between ease-of-use and security \u2013 while keeping you in full control of your personal data.\nThe Mooltipass Mini BLE connects to any USB or Bluetooth Low Energy-capable device (phone, tablet, computer, etc). To use it, just insert your personal smartcard, unlock it with your PIN, and you're good to go. You'll be able to log in anywhere with a quick tap on the desk or a few tweaks of the scroll wheel!\n\nBut What Can It Do, Exactly?\nOver Bluetooth Low Energy or USB, your Mooltipass Mini BLE can:\nAutomatically log you into websites using our Chrome, Firefox or Opera extensions\nLet you use the secure WebAuthn authentication technology\n Behave like a keyboard to type credentials or text on any device\nDisplay text and credentials on its OLED screen\nAutomatically log you in to your computer\nStore and recall small files or notes\nBecause our device is completely open-source, the Mooltipass team \u2013 together with contributors from all over the globe \u2013 is continuously adding new features. Even after your device reaches your doorstep, you'll be able to update it securely to get new functionality.\n\n Why Should You Use a Dedicated Device? \nMany people use software tools to store and organize their passwords. That's a great first step, but consider what happens if a piece of particularly nasty malware compromises your computer. It can steal your password database, and the next time you use your software tool to log in to a website, the malware can steal your master password. This isn't just hypothetical: something similar happened to a well-known password vault. Since we decouple the decryption key from your computer, it becomes much harder for a malicious program to make off with all of your account information.\nDo You Use the Same Password (or a Set of Similar Passwords) in Multiple Places? \nWell, you've certainly solved the problem of remembering your passwords, but have you considered what happens if one of those services is compromised and your password is stolen? The attacker now knows the email address you used to register for the service and your reused password. He can now use them to access a lot of information about you. For example:\nE-bill reminders\nBank information\nAccounts for online merchants\nAnd all the other services you use...\nHopefully you haven't used the same password for any of those services... but don't forget many services will email you a password reset link. With all of this information at their fingertips, a malicious person can easily take control of your online life! \nOK, So You Used a Different Password for Your Email Address... But What About the Password Reset Questions?\nMany people's accounts are compromised because they did nothing more than choose security questions to which the answers are easily guessed or can be found online. Your high school, or mother's maiden name? Perhaps those can be found on your Facebook account or LinkedIn profile. The Mini can help here, too. You can have it remember obscure answers to security questions for you!\nAs You Can See, the Strength of Your Security is Only as Strong as the Weakest Part.\nAs clich\u00e9d as it sounds, the only way to ensure your accounts stay secure is to use unique and complex passwords for each one. That's why we created the Mooltipass devices \u2013 to make it easy to start (and continue) good security practices for all of your online accounts. The Mooltipass can even help you out by generating long, complex, random passwords whenever you create a new account or change an existing password.\n\nThe Unique Mooltipass Mini BLE Architecture\nFor maximum device security, the Mooltipass team decided to split our device 'brain' in two. One processor is in charge of the complex protocols for communicating with the outside world, while the other handles all security-related features. While this substantially increased our development effort, it also dramatically increases security.\n\nCustomize Your Security Level\nWhen it comes to security, we all have our preferences. Some prefer letting the device do what it needs to, while others prefer to approve each operation that needs to be performed. That's why the Mooltipass Mini BLE includes both an \"easy\" and an \"advanced\" mode. The latter allows you to customize your security preferences and enables other advanced features such as credential categories. Want to know more? Have a look at our user manual.\n\nThe Mooltipass Ecosystem Security Model\nThe Mooltipass Mini BLE has the same security model as its brothers and sisters \u2013 namely:\n A Smartcard \u2013 To store the AES-256 encryption key for your protected information securely. This disconnects the encryption key from your secured data, meaning that even if your computer is compromised, the encryption key cannot be accessed by malicious software on the machine.\n PIN-based Authentication \u2013 4 wrong PIN entries and the card will self-destruct, putting a significant damper on the viability of brute-force attacks with a stolen card. Don't worry, it's easy to duplicate your access card securely, so you'll have a backup if something happens to the original!\n Tamper Detection \u2013 To ensure nobody has tinkered with your Mooltipass Mini BLE, its aluminum case includes a mechanism that prevents opening without deforming the case.You'll know instantly if it's been altered.\n Fully Encrypted Backups \u2013 You can rest assured knowing that the backup files are encrypted using the same key stored on your smartcard. Even if someone compromises your computer (or cloud storage account) and obtains the exported data, they will not be able to decrypt your passwords.\n Secure Firmware Updates \u2013 The Mooltipass Mini BLE includes a way to update the firmware safely, using digital signatures. This allows you to take advantage of new features on your device as we develop them!\n\nMultiple Users, Multiple Cards... I'm Lost! \nWe realize that all the possibilities that the Mooltipass ecosystem offers can be confusing at first. Here's what you should know about Mooltipass devices:\n One Mini BLE can be shared by multiple people, each with their own card\n One person can use multiple Mooltipass Minis, the same card for all of them\n Smartcards can be cloned safely without compromising security\n Credentials are encrypted safely inside the Mooltipass Mini BLE \n Credentials can be exported safely\u2013 backups are encrypted!\n You only need to remember one card PIN to access all your credentials \n\nWebAuthn Passwordless Authentication\nYou may have heard about WebAuthn. To simplify a bit, it makes passwords obsolete by authenticating you securely with signed cryptographic challenges. You simply need to approve a prompt on the device and \u2013 ta-da! \u2013 you're logged in. Yes, the Mooltipass Mini BLE supports it!\n\nThe Mooltipass Mini BLE Software Companion\nMoolticute was created 5 years ago by one of our contributors and, soon after, became the official open-source software companion for Mooltipass devices. Among others, Moolticute allows you to:\nUse native browser integration on Chrome, Firefox and Opera\nImport, export and synchronize your credentials\nFully customize your Mooltipass device behavior\nSave and recall files stored on the device\nAdd, delete and modify your credentials\nMass import unencrypted credentials\nUpdate your device securely\n\nOur Commitment to Open Source\nOur team believes that great security can only be achieved through complete transparency. That's why we have been publishing everything that goes into making the Mooltipass on our GitHub repository from the project's start.\nJust like Linux-based operating systems, open source allows our product to benefit from many engineers' expertise. This results in better code quality, more trust from our final users and verified security implementation.\nWe publish everything we do to provide you with the best possible security device.\n\nDo You Want to Contribute?\nDo you also share our passion for open source security and want to contribute? Send us a message to join our development team. With the development board you see above, we are making it easy to test code on the Mooltipass Mini BLE.\n\nHardware Specifications\nThe Mooltipass Mini BLE is designed with you in mind. It is made of scratch-resistant aluminum and is small enough to be carried in your pocket. Compared to our previous device, the mini BLE includes a new ruggedized scroll wheel for an easy scrolling experience through your credentials.\n Device Size: 89 x 35.5 x 12.5mm\n Working Voltage: 4.75V to 5.25V\n Battery Type: NiMH 300mAh\n Connector: USB-C 2.0 (full speed)\n Internal Memory: 8Mb\n Smart Card Support: AT88SC102\n True Random Number Generation \n Interface Type: clickable scroll wheel\n Case Material: Brushed Anodized Aluminum\n Display: 256x64 4bits per pixel 2.08\" blue OLED screen\n\nDevice Languages, Unicode Support\nLanguages are regularly being added to our device. At the time of writing, the Mooltipass Mini BLE supports English, German, Spanish, French, Slovenian, Portuguese, Croatian, and Finnish. If you'd like to help us add others, please get in touch with us! We're also planning to add support for Asian and Arabic fonts.\n\nPost-Kickstarter Campaign Timeline\nAs with our two previous crowdfunding campaigns, we will provide regular progress updates until your unit(s) arrive at your door. While 40 beta testers have been using our devices during the last 6 months, there are still a few nice-to-haves and mass-production related features we need to implement before the Mooltipass Mini BLE code is completely ready. \nOur crowdfunding campaign will finish at the end of August, so we are planning to use the months of September, October and possibly November to implement the aforementioned features, in addition to:\ndesigning and producing the device packaging\ndesigning our custom mass programming rig \npassing CE/FCC & Bluetooth certifications\nsetting up our fulfillment center\nbriefing our device assembler\nselecting USB-C cables\nWe are not expecting any unpleasant surprises,  as we'll mostly be repeating what we've already done with the Mooltipass Mini! However, the current pandemic situation will likely force us to conduct more of these production tasks remotely.\nIf all goes well, we anticipate device assembly will take place in November or December so you could see your device by Christmas or in January!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mooltipass project has been ongoing since 2014, and the Mini BLE has been under development during the last three years and a half. The core team from the Mooltipass product is still at the helm, bringing all of their experience and knowledge from before, in addition to the things we learned from our two previous devices.\n\nThe main risk for our project is one the world is very familiar with : the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn January 2020, our flight to go to Hong Kong to meet again our device assembler was cancelled. We have worked with him remotely since then but we however still need to go there to bring RF testing equipment and to pass CE, FCC and Bluetooth certifications.\nUnless the travel ban stays for many months, we prefer continuing the partnership we have built with these companies over the last 7 years.\n\nAs much as we'd like to guarantee a smooth production run without hiccups, there will always be unpredictable events that may arise when producing large quantities of an item.

My name is Kindra and I live in Seattle, Washington.  I am the founder of PursePal\u2122 - The Anti Theft Purse/Bag Lock for Women and Men. \nI have been manufacturing a variety of women's purse accessories since 2012 and have mainly been selling my products on Etsy or similar websites.  My other purse related products have all been smaller scale, with me producing them by hand in my spare time.\nThis is my first crowd funding project ;-)\n 2019 marked the highest ever reported incidents of purse and bag snatching nationwide. \nThieves are growing bolder with lifting purses/bags out of shopping carts, park benches, parked vehicles, dining tables and more while you are focused else ware.  It is not just a local rising concern here in Seattle, but nationwide!\nDue to Covid-19 and it's global effects, 2020 theft rates are already on the rise. Up 25% in some parts of the United States. \n PursePal\u2122 aims to prevent theft by securing your bag while not in hand, so you can focus on your day.  Whether it be picking up groceries at the local market or pushing your child on a swing at a neighborhood park,  PursePal\u2122 has your back!\nWe lock our houses, we lock our cars, isn't it about time we lock our bags and purses?\nWith your support, we can help in reducing these growing statistics.  As well as bring comfort and security back to men and women when they are out and about during their day.\nPursePal\u2122 will be my first larger scale product that I feel every man or women can greatly benefit from.  Originally, it was my niece Emma that sparked the idea of a purse/bag lock.  One day while grocery shopping, I asked her to watch my purse while I grabbed something down the aisle.  She then asked me why don't I have a lock for my purse.  It was at this moment, I realized nothing like this existed and the idea of PursePal\u2122 began.  I then took the idea to a close friend of mine who is an amazing innovator and engineer.  Within three weeks, we had a prototype.  Then after another three months of testing and further prototypes, we had our final production design.\n High Break Strength\nSecure your bag with peace of mind.  Features a 100lb elastic cord and a 60lb locking mechanism.\nEven the strongest of strong cannot go up against it!\nQuick lock and unlock \nWith the proper knowledge, add or remove easily using two hands.  No key or combination to hassle with in slowing down your day.  Don't be fooled though, you have to be familiar and practiced on how to unlock it properly.   Thieves lift bags within a second or two and are looking for the fastest getaway.  PursePal has your back!\nLightweight & easily stowed\nFeather light at only 18 grams and with an overall length of two inches, it easily stows in your purse or bag while not in use.  Drop it in or secure it to one of your straps for even easier access for next use.\nCut Resistant\nOur elastic cord is not only strong, but resilient to withstand attempted cutting.  Specially designed elastic cord creates a loud popping sound if compromised to notify bag owner.\nLet the color pop!\nChoose from a variety of loud or soft cord and lock colors.  Make a statement to all with your personalized color combination.\nProtection in your car!\nProtection while dining!\nProtection at the playground!\nProtection at your outdoor event!\nProtection at da club!\nColor Choices!\nWhat We Need & What You Get\nBecause of our limited budget, we are seeking to raise funds to initiate production and allow PursePal into the hands of thousands of people.   The locks we use are custom made and machined.  We can produce a limited quantity using our in house lathe and drill press etc.  However, to produce higher quantities, we sought out help by a local machine shop here in Seattle.  This machine shop has a minimum start up cost of $5,000 to build a custom jig for our project.  After this initial setup, they can produce these locks for us on an as needed basis and with a low minimum order quantity of 50 units.\nThis is how we arrived to our campaign goal amount.  \nAfter three prototypes and lots of testing, we are ready for production!   That being said, we estimate shipping to take place soon after this campaign ends.  Est June 2020.  Although delays can occur, we do not foresee many.   We will keep everyone current with updates throughout the campaign as well as in post.\n We have a fairly large amount of material ready to go.  We can also quickly obtain more of our raw components when required. \nPERKS!\nSupporter - Don't wish to order a PursePal\u2122 but still want to show your support?

There is no MOQ (minimum order quantity) for raw materials but we do get price breaks after a certain amount which is why we hope to exceed our campaign goal. ;)\n\nAs stated in our story, the local machine shop here in Seattle that we are going to use to machine our locks have a minimum start up cost of $5,000. This machine shop has been around for over 10 years and we do not see them going anywhere or changing their quoted price. However, we have already sourced two alternative machine shops we can use as back ups in case this shop for whatever reason cannot be used when required.\n\nThe remaining materials we use for PursePal can be obtained from multiple sources if needed as well.\n\nOther than the custom made locks, we will be hand assembling each and every PursePal. Our small team can produce approximately 35 units per hour. However, we can always obtain more help if we greatly exceed our campaign goal.\n\nIf our campaign surpasses $50k (approx 2500 units) reward fulfillment will need to be pushed back to approximately October 2020. This will allow us time to get more help, gather more materials, machine the locks, get them assembled and shipped.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe materials used in each PursePal are designed to be long lasting.

How did it go? It's usually a pain, one way or the other, isn\u2019t it? Here's how we can change things for the better:\nThe FLUXBAG is a revolutionary new kind of air pump that inflates items like pool toys, air mattresses or sleeping pads effortlessly and in an instant. It is practically a \"self-inflating air pump\": You simply connect it to your inflatable, breath into it JUST ONCE, and then push 100/140L of air effortlessly into your inflatable item. \nThe FLUXBAG, in a nutshell, is an air pump without the effort, much faster, smaller and more lightweight than other air pumps, and doubles as a huge XXL dry bag or a comfy beach pillow. \n\nWe successfully launched the FLUXBAG here on Kickstarter back in 2016. Now we are returning with an extensively tried and tested, much more sophisticated and matured product. All connector, adapter, and nozzle parts have been redesigned to make the FLUXBAG compatible with virtually all valves that you'll find with inflatables in the leisure segment. You will also be able to 3D-print your own custom nozzle.  \n(1) EFFORTLESS: Inflate items with just ONE breath\nYou simply blow into the FLUXBAG just once or twice - no wind or running necessary\nFor many inflatables just ONE breath and the force of gravity is all that it takes to fully inflate them. How on earth can this work? How would you inflate a 100/140L bag with only the 3 liters of air that your lungs can hold? It's smartly applied physics called the Bernoulli Principle: \nBlow into the FLUXBAG once or twice to fill it in just a few seconds ..\nThe \"breathing jet\" you create by exhaling into the FLUXBAG somewhat counterintuitively creates a lower air pressure in the bag. The surrounding air is then sucked into the FLUXBAG - you close it quickly and have 100/140 liters available to push into most any inflatable of your liking. It's the same physical effect that makes aircrafts fly.\n.. then push 100/140L of air effortlessly into your inflatable\nThus the FLUXBAG does not need any wind, nor do you need to run around with it or hopelessly wave it through the air, unlike those \u2013 often highly dysfunctional \u2013 inflatable beach sofa loungers.\n(2) FASTER: Continuous airflow through optimized nozzles\nUnlike conventional manual air pumps, the FLUXBAG creates a powerful continuous airflow that you achieve just by using gravity and your body's weight instead of your muscles or lungs. What's more, our nozzle geometries are optimised for maximum airflow\nCompared to a run-of-the-mill battery-powered electric air pump, the FLUXBAG not only performs faster but is also much more portable and uses far fewer resources to manufacture. Someone made a quick one-minute YouTube video running both devices side by side. (Text inserts are in German, but you'll surely get the idea..)  \nAnother advantage of the FLUXBAG \u2013 compared to standard 15-to 20-dollar electric pumps: You can exert a higher air pressure with it and thus FULLY inflate your e.g. pool toy or air bed which then won\u2019t be as \"floppy\" as if they have been inflated with an electric pump.\nA few examples, tested with the new FLUXBAG PRO\n\n(3) SMALLER & LIGHTER: More bang for the gram\nThe FLUXBAG is literally pocket-sized and weighs less than 150 grams. We achieve this by using very lightweight but highly durable fabrics that you find with other professional outdoor gear. That 150g is only 1/5 the weight of other air pumps.\nThe FLUXBAG is much lighter - but also a lot smaller than other air pumps\n(4) MULTIPLE USES: Doubles as an XXL dry bag or a beach pillow\nAlso a very large and very lightweight dry bag\nIt's 3-in-1: Many love the FLUXBAG's double use as a huge dry bag. When backpacking with only a small tent, the FLUXBAG is perfect to store stuff outside. Or use it as a backpack liner for extra water protection, or perhaps as a sturdy, reusable laundry bag. Since it comes with an air-tight lid, just form a triple knot with the roll-up closure's ends to turn it into a pillow, and you can quite comfortably rest your head or back against the FLUXBAG when you want to relax on the beach or on a trekking tour.\nNeed a pillow on the beach or on a trekking tour? FLUXBAG has you covered.\n A few quick demo videos..\n\nFLUXBAG 3rd Generation: All new features and fittings \nThis is the product we always wanted to make. We completely redesigned all the nozzles and connector parts and even added new ones. We optimised geometries, surface coarseness, and the material's elasticity. The silicone coating on the conical nozzles is a world's first. All this allows for significantly higher air pressures. It is like the \"Porsche of air pump nozzle sets\".\nThe FLUXBAG now reliably connects with all common valves\nYou will also be able to 3D-print your own custom nozzle if you like. Scroll down for details.\nAny kind or brand of outdoor sleeping pads will fit any FLUXBAG now\nThe new FLUXBAG 3.0 now perfectly connects with ALL outdoor sleeping pads, regardless of the manufacturer. With a direct flat-valve connection (2 sizes) and our trusted silicone tube adapters (4 flexible tubes) for screw-top valves in all sizes, like e.g. Therm-a-rest, we now have the most versatile and practical solution. \nThe new blow-back-protected connector now allows the FLUXBAG to inflate even the largest balloons\nWe also added a built-in non-return valve into the new FLUXBAGs that prevents the air from flowing back when you apply multiple \"fluxes\" to inflate larger items such as older air beds or even the largest pool floats. The FLUXBAG is the world's first and only pump sack with that feature.\nThe new extension trunk makes it a lot easier to connect the FLUXBAG with larger inflatables\nWe made an extension trunk as a new add-on that improves the FLUXBAG's functionality with hard-to-reach valves that are typically found on large aquatic toys or inflatable boats. While this accessory will sell separately for 10 USD/EUR later, we are tossing it in for FREE with every FLUXBAG pre-ordered here on Kickstarter. \nThe new FLUXBAGs come with an illustrated user guide\nFinally, there will be a new extensively-illustrated manual that will help you to make the most of your new FLUXBAG. Although the product is very easy to use, it takes a bit of practice to get a hang of it. The new manual will help you to achieve that within minutes.\nPlease note that the FLUXBAG is only suitable for low to medium air pressure items. The physics unfortunately do not allow for use with high-pressure items such as bicycle tires, SUPs, surf kites or heavy-duty rafts - unless you weigh a metric ton. As a rule of thumb: If you could inflate it with your mouth and lungs or a standard electric pump, you can also do it with a FLUXBAG.\nProject timeline and use of funds\nWe will use the funds we raise from you guys here on Kickstarter to make the rather expensive steel molds for the new plastic parts and weld the new extension trunks. \nAll the textile FLUXBAG bodies (the actual \"bag\" part) have been manufactured already \u2013 and they're just great!  \nAll the textile parts have been manufactured already and are of outstanding quality\nPick your FLUXBAG! What's in the pack?\nTop: FLUXBAG PRO (140L, Nylon) Bottom: FLUXBAG FUN (100L, Polyester)\nFLUXBAG 3.0 comes in two sizes, and both variations are fitted with the same sets of accessories. When it comes to choosing your FLUXBAG, the major differences are capacity and \u2013 to a certain extent \u2013 handling:\nFLUXBAG PRO specs\nThe FLUXBAG PRO's 140-liters capacity allows you to quickly inflate even the largest items. Its 60cm-wide opening makes filling it slightly more challenging than with the only 50cm-wide FUN version since the Bernoulli principle will not play quite as easily with the wider opening. That being said, the difference in usability may be no more than 15 minutes of practice. It's made of high quality rip-stop Nylon (PA).\nFLUXBAG FUN specs\nOur FLUXBAG FUN provides you with 100 liters of air in one go (approx. 30% less than the PRO). You may have to re-flux more to fill the same inflatable. On the other hand, the FUN is easier to handle compared with the PRO since it is only 50cm wide and faster to fill with just one breath. It's made of high quality polyester fabric in the same specifications as the PRO's nylon.\nFor the Balloons United Edition we added 5 click-on adapter disks to a fully-fledged FLUXBAG PRO\nSince the new generation FLUXBAGs come with built-in blow-back-protection, you can use them to inflate balloons of any size now. With our friends at Balloons United \u2013 perhaps the world's best and biggest online store for anything balloons \u2013 we made a special edition for all the looners among us.\nNeed any custom parts? \nWe have covered all common kinds and sizes of valves in the leisure and outdoor segment. Yet there surely is that special-sized valve where none of the nozzles will fit (well). Also, you may come up with your own idea of what to do and connect with your FLUXBAG \u2013something no one has ever thought of before.. \nTo make the FLUXBAG useful even for these special cases, we will provide a 3D file download of the nozzle base as well as the connector thread from our website after the Kickstarter campaign is finished, so you can design and print yourself whatever nozzle, connector \u2013 or anything else \u2013 you may need.\nA thankful note to the backers of our first Kickstarter campaign in 2016\nWithout you, there would be no FLUXBAG! We so much appreciate your support and trust at a time when we were admittedly quite clueless about what we were getting ourselves into. We had sent you a final backer update a few days ago where we shared some of our experiences from the last two years.\nThe final screen of our 2016 Kickstarter campaign that made all this possible\nIn this new campaign we created special rewards that we thought would fit your needs without having to rob the bank: You can just pledge for the new kit. Also, there are attractive limited packages of a new FLUXBAG with an additional kit that will upgrade your old 2016 Kickstarter Edition as well. If you got a multi-pack back then, you will be able to add more new kits for only a little more money when you check out your new reward in Backerkit. We hope that works for everybody!\nLooking back: A round trip via German \"Shark Tank\" \u2013 and even Amazon\nThis all started in early summer 2016 when we came up with the idea and made the first prototypes from polyethylene (PE) tube foil. \nJune 2016: Demoing the first prototypes. For some reasons we wanted to lie on the thing back then, LOL\nOnly a few weeks later, we successfully introduced the FLUXBAG on Kickstarter. We went to China, had the first batch made, and properly shipped these pre-orders in Winter 2017. \nDecember 2016: Lucas at our first manufacturer in Dongguan\nShortly after that, we found ourselves on the official German version of \"Shark Tank\" (\"Die H\u00f6hle der L\u00f6wen\", literally \"The Lions' Den\" on German VOX) where we cut a deal with Ralf D\u00fcmmel. In the end we decided not to give away any company shares and just licensed the product to our \"shark's\" company in order to pocket some money from the TV show. Ralf's company made and sold tens of thousands of their licensed FLUXBAGs that used a cheaper and much heavier fabric than we did. To our knowledge, it is therefore already the world's best-selling pump sack.  \nMarch 2017: Filming DHDL/German \"Shark Tank\" with products from our first Kickstarter campaign\nLast summer our own original FLUXBAGs that we had manufactured a year earlier became a bestseller on German Amazon. The product consistently ranked among the top 5 manual air pumps in Amazon.de's \"Sports & Outdoor\" department.\nBut frankly, 3.7 stars from reviews on Amazon is below what we set out to achieve. All design and manufacturing happened extremely fast and within a period of just a few months - our 1st and 2nd generation products were very similar and definitely had a few kinks. This revolutionary idea deserves better - and we will deliver!\nWe listened very carefully to the customer feedback we got, and went back to the drawing board. Now we have completely redesigned and greatly improved everything molded & plastic that came with the Generation 1.0 and 2.0 products and added new nozzles, adapters and an accessory. It may not sound like much, but it makes the FLUXBAG something that is REALLY helpful, practical, and honest.\nWe are HILFE Industries\nLeft: Jens \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 Right: Lucas (takes time off)\nWe founded HILFE Industries in 2016 as a product generator startup in Leipzig, Germany and Hong Kong. For the new generation FLUXBAGs we are working with Henning Seide, a Leipzig-based product designer specialising in 3D for plastic moulding.\nFulfillment & Shipping\nWe are using Backerkit again to streamline the process for everyone. Backerkit helps keep track of your shipping address even if you are moving. It will also let you add more items to your Kickstarter pledge. \nYour rewards will be shipped with a tracking ID directly from Hong Kong at very favourable international rates.\nThe FLUXBAG is \"customs friendly\" - we have not heard from anyone in our first Kickstarter whose shipment was held by customs in order to charge additional fees or taxes. We will pull some strings again to make sure you receive your reward as smoothly.\nPhoto Credits: Team FLUXBAG at the DHDL TV studio: VOX / Bernd-Michael Maurer /// Team FLUXBAG portrait at the beach: Anne Schwerin /// Some in-situ photo: Jessica Zaydan /// Product studio shots: Sophia Kesting, Franziska Krepp", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou may consider this a low-risk Kickstarter project for various reasons:\n\n(1) This is a 3rd generation product, we have been doing this for a good two years already. Thousands of customers have used earlier versions, we got a lot of feedback and have worked out kinks in earlier versions.\n\n(2) The textile \"bag parts\" have been already manufactured and are of outstanding quality. Our QA rejection rate there is significantly below 0.5%.\n\n(3) For the new components, we continue working with our established network of suppliers in China. We know them all, have visited the factories and built mutual trust. Still, we have contracts of course and will employ third-party quality assurance services as we did before. We will be in China when your rewards are assembled and packaged to ensure professional quality standards.\n\n(4) We are a real company established in 2016, not just a couple of guys with a cool idea. To us, Kickstarter is an extremely important platform to introduce future products - so we won't ruin our standing here. Expect something literally bright later this year from HILFE Industries here on KS.\n\nEven so, there are residual risks: If Jens as the project's leader dies in a plane crash, the project is in serious trouble. If our plastic molder's factory in Guangzhou or our fulfillment center in Hong Kong burns down, there will be delays. But frankly, we suggest you trust this.

WHY MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS & WEGA ARE GAME CHANGERS\nCyclists can't escape darkness: It returns every evening and sometimes even at daytime when passing tunnels. Battery lights seem comfortable with quick & easy installation but there will be moments when the batteries are empty while you need them most.\nWith Magnic Microlights you don't have to fear these moments because you have neverending light :\n\nBenefits of Magnic Microlights:\nNon Contact : You don't feel or hear them\nNo batteries - Neverending power\nStrong enough to enlight the road ahead\nEasy To Install \nCool \"invisible\" design: Compact size without adapters\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nWorks with all bicycle models - WEGA for disc brakes\nDon't fear the dark! The best time to cycle is whenever you want.\nMagnic Microlights are the world\u2019s smallest non-contact dynamos, that are integrated together with electronics and lighting system in the brake shoes. In 2012 we presented our invention Magnic Light here on Kickstarter. Many \"experts\" did not believe this principle can work and believed our lights would be a fake but the MAGIC is clever usage of well known eddy current technology. With more than 17.000 Magnic lights on the road via our successful Magnic Light IC campaign 2014 and our webshop we have proved that this sustainable, environment-friendly technology has the power to replace battery lights for bicycles. \nThe last 18 months we worked hard on the development of the Micro-Technology. With Magnic Microlights you can add non-contact dynamo light to your bicycle without need of extra adapters. If your bicycle has disc brakes choose Wega which has flexibility in four directions and fits to nearly all other bikes (except Vbrake/Canti systems), too.  \n3D Printed material, Fully functional contactless generator & PCB Board electronic.\nMAGNIC MICROLIGHT compared to WEGA- THE MICROLIGHT for disc brakes. We named it WEGA because of the similarity with the stellar constellation Lyra and it's brightest star Wega\nWEGA might be the most universal bike light on planet earth\nHOW CAN THESE TINY LIGHTS BE STRONG?\nBeneath generator technology one important aspect is the optimal choice of LED + lens which gives a big advantage compared to normal LED bicycle lights. For the Magnic Microlights we have chosen the newest extreme density - Cree LED (available since summer 2018): The most efficient high power LED with minimum size (1.6 mm x 1.6mm compared to 3.45mm x 3.45mm as used in many LED biycle lights).\n\nWhat does this mean for Magnic Microlights?\n\nImagine you have a good bicycle light with 3,45mm x 3,45 mm LED, Lens of size 34,5 mm and 100 Lumen/Watt (These are quite excellent values for biycle lights).  \nMagnic Microlights don't have the strongest generators (because cyclists should not feel anything!) but they have the best light efficiency on the market: 200 Lumen/Watt !\nWith same current and tiny lenses MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS & WEGA have twice the power of large high quality LED/lens applications.\n2. WHICH REWARD FITS YOUR BIKE?\nSee the specification here and preorder on the top right of this page.\nMAGNIC LIGHT TEAM CLOTHING\nSee pictures in the gallery\n3. LET ANIMATIONS EXPLAIN FUNCTIONS \nWe have tested the current brakeshoe design from May to October on roadbikes & mountainbikes with more than 3000 test kilometers. Although the stability of the prototype material (3d printed PLA) did not match that of the final product, there was no  difference in braking performance compared to standard brakes that we otherwise use in training and everyday cycling.\nSee more details in the gallery...\nTECHNICAL DATA\n\nOur prototypes are less efficient than the final version because of lower generator power. We have to estimate the power of the final product based on the prototypes and our experience from the current Magnic Light version.\n\nBRAKE LIGHT\nMagnic Microlights have an effective brake light function. When you pull the brakes the distance between rim and generator decreases resulting in higher generator power and higher light output. The brake light works precisely and is a clear signal for subsequent traffic.\nAll Magnic Microlights have an integrated \"Brake Light\"-function shown here: When you pull the brakes the lights brighten up which warns the driver behind you.\nBEAM ADJUSTMENT\nThe design of front-& rearlight allows to adjust the light beam regardless of the fork angle. Even for extreme bicycle frame geometry you can adjust the light beam towards the road.\nBRAKE RUBBER REPLACEMENT\nWorn brake pads can be exchanged easily as you would expect from standard brakes. \nSHIFT MECHANISM\nAfter longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. The generator performance stongly depends on the rim distance so we have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant small. An exchangeable shift-element moves the generator away from the rim and prevents grinding of the generator part.\nAfter longer usage your brakepads will loose up to 5mm material before you have to exchange them. We have integrated an automatic shift mechanism to keep the distance between generator and rim constant which is important for performance of the system.\nWEGA VISIBILITY\n\nWega is visible from both sides\nSee more details in the gallery...\n                                                                                                                         4. HOW CAN YOUR BIKE GLOW AT NIGHT?\nWhen we tried to assemble the \"perfect\" bicycle for this technology we were fascinated by the combination with phosphorescent wheels and decided to offer the Magnic Night Bike as reward, too.\nHere you see the \"Glow ion the dark\" effect of the Magnic Night Bike wheels.\n These are custom made wheels. In addition to the phosphorescent painting these are high quality welded aluminium rims which you only find on upper class roadbikes (like Shimano or Mavic). Even if \"normal\" rims work good with all Magnic Lights these rims are welded and don't have a magnetic rim joint. \n \n\nPREMIUM\nThe Magnic Night Bike is unique! You won't find something like this in any bike shop! Click on the image to reach the gallery.\n   See more details in the gallery...\nFour Magnic Microlights enlight the welded \u201cGlow in the dark\" rims. To keep your trousers clean when cycling we have replaced the standard chain by a Carbon belt drive from the leading company for bicycle belt drives : Gates. Magnic Microlights need no cables so this bike follows the no-cables concept (except brake cables) but allows to shift between low and high speed gear with the automatic Sturmey Archer hub.\nCLASSIC\nThe CLASSIC version comes with a standard chain. You can turn the rear while and either us as free-wheel single speed bike or as FIXE with rigid hub.\nSee more details in the gallery...\n6. FASCINATING TECHNOLOGY & PHYSICS\nThe main technology of our lights is based on eddy current induction.\n  PLAY\n\nThe core part is the world\u2019s smallest contact- and frictionless bicycle dynamo, that is integrated together with the electronic and the lighting system in the brake shoe of a calliper brake. The world-wide patented technic developed by the German company Magnic Innovations is based on  eddy current induction: a magnetic wheel in a generator separated from the bicycle rim by a narrow air gap induces temporary magnetic fields even in non-magnetic aluminium bicycle rims when the bicycle rim is moving. This leads to the magnetic wheel rotating contactlessly as if by magic.\nNeither batteries nor external cables, further fittings or spoke-magnets are necessary. Only the brake shoes have to be exchanged for microlight - brake shoes, so that the maintenance only involves the exchange of worn brake pads after thousands of kilometres. The included brake pads are compatible with other standard brake pads of other manufacturers as available in every cycle shop.\nEddy current\nEddy currents (I, red) induced in a conductive metal plate (C) as it moves to right under a magnet (N)\nThe key is so-called eddy current technology : Energy is drawn from the rotating bicycle wheels without any physical contact, and thus without friction. Instead, eddy currents, created by strong magnets, generate electricity to power the lights: When the wheel spins, magnets inside the generator induce eddy currents with corresponding magnetic fields in the wheel, which in turn interact with the magnets in the generator. The resulting electricity will power your lights indefinitely without any environmentally harmful batteries or cumbersome cables.\nWhile the previous larger Magnic Lights were equipped with two LEDs (one for stand light) Magnic Microlights have just one LED which is fed by ultra-high efficient Mosfet rectifiers.\n7. HOW THE FUTURE CAN BE SMART\nThe SMART VERSION presented here can only be realized within the rangeof this project if we reach a very high stretch goal of 500.000 \u20ac. We don't expect to reach this goal but present what is possible if we do. (In case this amount is reached the reward for the SMART VERSION will be available in the rewards section and you can switch if you like).   \nReason for the high stretch goal: High cost for final development of bluetooth control software & electronics. At the moment we have implemented the main features with prototypes based on the electronic boards and microprocessors of the larger MAGNIC LIGHT IC version.\nTurn Signals  \nThe Smart version comes with a cool novelty : A blink system for turn signals without any additional switches and even without a smartphone. How does it work? If you tap the brake lever the distance between Microlights and rim changes which can be detected in the lights (even without braking). A double-tap is our signal for the blinker: If you double-tap the right brake lever the rear lights detect the signal and via bluetooth to the front lights- so that lights on the right side are blinking. Correspondingly this works on the left side.  \nNavigation  \nNavigation is similar to the turn signals - but here you are guided and need our Smartphone App for navigation: Lights are controlled by the navigation app and start to blink on the left or right side when you have to turn left/right. Put your smartphone in your bag and let the lights guide your way.  \nSpeed Data Transmission  \nThe smart Magnic Microlights are equipped with a Bluetooth LE microcontroller which easily detects the rotation speed of your wheel from the incoming current. Via smartphone or Bluetooth LE compatible speedometer you can receive speed data for display or further processing. This feature replaces Bluetooth LE speed sensors which have the same function but need extra mounting and extra batteries.  \nCrash detection with emergency call  \nThis feature requires some future development and is still theory. In case of a crash generators will stop abruptly. We need some test data but we are confident to be able to detect a crash situation reliably which can be sent to the smartphone in order to make an emergency call.  \nConfiguraton for Stand light and more  \nWe will offer different stand light patterns which can be set via Smartphone App. Additionally it will be possible to switch the internal orientation of the lights (for example for correct turn signals if your left and right brake levers deviate from standard installations).\n8. HOW WE DO POLITICS: GERMAN STVZO   \nNov. 5th 2018, UPDATE\nConcering German STVZO approval for our new lighting technology some frustrating years are behind us. But we did not give up and we achieved that the highest responsable committees were invloved in new rules for STVZO approval concerning our technology. Today we were informed that our main ideas could influence the new legislation which shall pass the Verkehrsauschuss (Committee of Transport) of the German Bundestag next month. We believe that the German rules are too complex and old fashioned and hopefully our efforts help to go in the right direction. For our systems (Magnic Light IC, and Magnic Microlights) this is good news because we finally can adjust our lights concerning to these rules.\nFor our technology here are the three most important new rules concerning Magnic Light:  \nFor lighting systems consisting of two separate lights (left & right) the total amount of light needs to exceed the minimum of 10 lux (and not each single light). (Otherwise our lights should have been twice as bright as the required minimum value at 15km/h while they easily do at >25 km/h) \nFor lens systems the \"brightest area\" can replace brightest point of the light distribution (which is the measurement point for the light distribution with respect to \"anti-blinding\" characteristics). The highest point within such an the \"brightest area\" can be taken as measurement point now which previously gave room for ambiguity. - \nThe German bicycle light lobby wanted to have a new rule that prohibits dynamos with less than 50% efficiency. Sounds reasonable but measurements for \"Micro\"-system are very complex (and expensive) because the result can be distorted by air resistance, wheel material, bearings, .. much more than these parameters influence large systems (hub dynamos). We could not stop this new rule but at least we could achieve that is is not necessary to prove efficiency charateristics for micro-dynamos below 1,3 Watts. (Background: The rule shall prevent cyclists from exerting too much effort for their dynamo lights- Consequently we should forbid non-aerodynamic clothin for cyclists in future because this costs much more energy ;.) I want to address this to the German Minister for Environment, Svenja Schulze at the Awards Ceromony for the Bundespreis Ecodesign on Nov. 26th in Berlin.\nFor a \"detailed analysis\" of the effort you have to pay for Magnic Microlights see the this video below:\n9.

OUR BACKGROUND\nCycling is an important part of our live- not just as a business. Below you see images from \"The Making of\" video & photo material for this project. Whenever we are cycling Magnic Lights & Magnic Microlights are with us (Cycling to Calais, in Berlin, on straw bales ...)\nSee details in the gallery ...\nOUR MISSION\nWe all just have this one live- why take the risk and cycle without light?\nWithout lighting, cyclists risk their lives in the dark - but those on the road with battery lights will soon be left in the dark when the journey takes too long or the batteries are no longer full. For those who do not want to mount heavy dynamos, use batteries or lay cables, we've launched two Kickstarter projects with our non-contact Magnic Lights, which feel like battery lighting without having to exchange or change batteries. Magnic Microlights can't be turned off at daylight and we are convinced this makes sense from a safety point of view: With lights on your visibilty increases significantly which means a great deal of safety.\nBattery Lights are not the option:\nFamily team\nDirk Strothmann (Management, CAD & Software Design,...)\nJ\u00f6rn Strothmann (Hardware Tests & Design)\n Antje Strothmann (Photo and video recordings, Shipments)\nLisa Strothmann (Aerial photo and video recordings)\nSarah Strothmann (photo presentation & test driver)\nHave a look how and where I am working:\nOur partners\nDevelopment and production of Magnic Lights strongly depends on our partners. Here you see our most important partners and coworkers:  \nVTS Elektronik Gmbh, F\u00fcrstenau /GER (Electronic Circuit Design, PCB Board Design & Automated/ Roboter PCB Board Assembly), Coil Winding & Assembly \nHAICHENG MOLD, Shenzhen /CHN Tooing & Injection mold processing\nShenzhen Hill optical technology ,CHN , Lens development & production\n12. ILLEGAL COPIES & PLAGIARISM\nOn the web you can find several illegal copies of our patented technology. \nPatent infringing Magnic Light plagiarism\n\nThe sellers don't care for patents and they also fool the customers because their produtcs don't work as promised (and will fail completely after ~30 hours usage because the internal batteries will be empty).\nOur original Magnic Lights with real functionality.

Finanzierungsbeitr\u00e4ge werden erst bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung nach Ablauf einer Zwei-Wochen Frist abgebucht.\nBesteht ein Risiko, wenn das Projektziel nicht erreicht wird?: Nein- Nach Projektende wird der Betrag nur dann eingezogen, wenn das Projektziel erreicht wurde.\n14. FAQ\nDo Magnic Microlights fit to my bike?\nYes- if you have \"Standard\" rim brakes (Caliper, Vbrake, Cantilver brakes). Even for disc brake systems we have a clamp adapter solution- but this is just for light and does not provide brake light.\nDo Magnic Microlights work with Carbon rims?\nNo- we need a metal rim. Aluminum is best. Magnesium works, too. \nI want to add mutiple rewards to my pledge. Is this possible?\nYes- This is ok for all available rewards except limited rewards (otherwise the limitation fails)  and complete bicycles (high shipping cost). Just add the amount for additional rewards to your pledge (without additional shipping cost). After project termination you will receive a survey where you can specify your desired combination. \nDo I have to exchange brake pads often?\nNo- \"Normal\" cyclists exchange their bicycles more frequently than the brake pads because these usually last for more than 5000 kilometers. Hardcore bikers have to exchange the brake pads from time to time.  \n\n15.

In the meantime we have received several awards worldwide patent grants for the Magnic Light technology. The last months we worked hard to make the Magnic Microlights ready for production and tested them thoroughly. \n\nThe Smart version will only be available, if we pass the high stretch goal. In contrast to the other rewards the smart version is not ready for production and needs some more development. For this reason delivery of the Smart version will take nearly one year (only in case the stretch goal will be reached).\n\nWe have analyzed production steps and risks carefully and don't want to promise more than we can deliver. This means that the majority of the rewards can't be shipped before May 2019.\n\nIn the project plan we have taken into account delays due to initial mistakes but it is clear that this is an estimation based on our previous experiences.

With IP65 rated waterproof, 360\u00b0 fingerprint recognition, ultra-long standby time and storage for 40 fingerprints, you need only one finger to keep your belongings safe.\nProblems Solved\uff1a\nNo more worry about forgetting your password. \nNo need to carry keys or a mobile phone with you. \nNo need for multiple steps just to open the lock. \nOne touch is all you need to open your secure lock. \nSay goodbye to your old bulky lock and step into the future. Chicso is so small that you can easily keep it in your pocket until you\u2019re ready to keep your stuff protected. Chicso is superior to the simple match-and-unlock mechanism on ordinary locks, as access is only allowed through your unique fingerprint.

A smart lock that loyally defends and protects your valuables on all of your journeys. \nChicso features a 3ft (1m) long retractable wire made from cut-resistant 304 stainless steel, which has a load-bearing capacity of 120kg. The shackle is flexible and incredibly strong which makes it the ideal lock for any situation. As an accessory, widely used for luggage, furniture, wardrobes, bike and anything else.\nChicso, unlike many other intelligent locks on the market, can prevent copycat fingerprints from thieves. This A.I. fingerprint identification solution reads prints in high resolution (508 dpi) and from 360 degrees. \nChicso knows the difference between a live fingerprint and a picture of a fingerprint and will reject anything that isn\u2019t 100% authentic. Chicso relies on independent A.I. technology to keep user biometric data safe and secure.  \nChicso allows for two administrator fingerprints which enables multi-user management. Up to 40 fingerprints can be registered on the lock so you can share it with friends and family.  \nWith 100% construction made of aviation grade aluminum alloy, Chicso is ready to handle daily bumps and bruises and can stand up to any tampering by force. \nChicso\u2019s design is super resistant to prying, slamming, cutting, or anything else that could break weaker locks. Chicso uses an integrated stamping method to create an aluminum alloy, making it ultra-strong and capable of standing up to potential breaking attempts. \nMultispectral recognition systems can read your fingerprint even if it\u2019s wet, oily, dry, or dirty. \nWith IP65 dust and water resistance, Chicso can stand up to the elements, meaning that it is excellent for both indoor and outdoor use. \n Chicso is also resistant to varying temperatures from -20\u00b0C-45\u00b0C\uff08-4\u00b0F-113\u00b0F\uff09. Take your Chicso wherever you go without worrying about environmental factors.  \nSmart locks need to be reliable, meaning that the battery should work for long periods. Chicso uses a 130mAh built-in battery, and the system is incredibly energy efficient, using only (0.5\u03bcm), allowing for one year of regular use (with more than 3,500 unlock/lock actions) or one year of standby on a single charge. Even if the battery dies, Chicso features quick charging technology to get powered up sooner rather than later. \nTEST VEDIO\nPLAY\n\n MEASUREMENT\nAbout Us \nWhenever we used to go out for exercise, fitness, swimming, etc., we would have to bring our traditional keys\u2014this caused a lot of inconvenience.

We want people to do whatever they choose without having to worry about their earphones falling out or becoming uncomfortable.\nDecibullz has a track record of creating some of the best sounding earphones available. Our earphones have been recognized by some of the industry's toughest critics earning two CES Innovation Awards as well as Reviewed.com's Best Earphone of 2015.

Decibullz makes some of the best hearing protection so it's no surprise that our earphones do an amazing job of blocking out external noise.\nBLUETOOTH 5.0\nThe Black Diamond earphones use the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology designed specifically for true wireless audio and data.

Decibullz has quickly become the leader in affordable custom earpieces making the best custom-fit earphones, earplugs, and acoustic filters on the market. Put simply, if it goes in your ear we make it better. \nDecibullz is located in Fort Collins Colorado. Our team is dedicated to the pursuit of bringing custom molded earpieces to the masses. \nTRUE WIRELESS DEVELOPMENT\nWe have been working on a custom molded true wireless earphone for years and Black Diamond has turned into a true passion project for the Decibullz team. We were tired of seeing me-too companies make the same true wireless products without adding any real value. We know that combining our custom molded earpieces with the latest Bluetooth technology would create truly amazing earphones. \n We have created and tested hundreds of prototypes in our pursuit to create the perfect earphones. \nWe scrutinized every aspect of the design, refusing to compromise or rest until everything was perfect.\n                ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done our best to keep the risks and challenges minimal for this project.

Unless hackers come to your office or home in person, there is no way for them to access the audio and video of your HELLO 2 when you\u2019ve deactivated them with the privacy buttons.

Therefore software cannot control them.\n\n\nNear Field Communication (NFC)\nNFC will allow you to easily jump into a whiteboarding session or video conferencing room, and share content or files of your choice through the HELLO 2 by simply bringing your phone close to the device.  \n\nWhen you join any office meeting room that uses HELLO 2, you can be set up and ready to go with a personalized experience in a matter of seconds!\n\nDual Screen Support \nThe new dual-screen feature allows you to connect HELLO 2 with two TVs at the same time so that you can use two different features on two separate TVs. If you need to use Whiteboarding and Video calling, Screen Sharing and Video Calling, and so on at the same time, you can use the dual-screen support to fully use whiteboarding on one TV, and fully see the video call feed on the other.\n\nProduct Timeline\nStay Tuned with US\nThank you so much for your continuous support!

Now, your ideas can live forever, even after they are erased!\nOrganize your quick notes and tasks \nShare brainstorms and updates with your team \nCapture your next million dollar idea\n                                                  The Think Board X works with Rocketbook's cloud organization system. Using the Rocketbook app, you assign 7 shortcut \u201csymbols\u201d to a destination of your choice. \nSave: Store files and documents to any folder in Dropbox, Google Drive, OneNote, OneDrive, Box, or Evernote. \nExecute: Send files straight to Trello, Slack, or email.\nAfter you have completed scanning, simply select the destination symbol(s) you would like to send your notes. The Rocketbook app instantly files your notes in the right place. Your notes, ideas and to-do lists will be more organized than ever before!\n             *After the campaign ends you will receive a Backerkit survey where you will have an opportunity to make additions to your order and confirm your shipping address.\n           The Think Board X naturally works best on walls and desks, but also works great on other fun surfaces such as: windows, refrigerators, tables, laptops, binders, notebooks, mirrors, chalkboards, whiteboards, old whiteboards, or whiteboard paint.\n            Unlike traditional whiteboards, the Think Board X erases clean every time because it is built with a proprietary polyester composite that is made to last. Our favorite markers are Expo Low Odor, but feel free to use any other dry erase markers found online or in-stores.\n            Whether you put your Think Board X on painted drywall, a wooden desk, or a stainless steel refrigerator, our micro-bead adhesive is specifically designed to not damage your surface or leave any residue behind.\n            The magic of the Rocketbook System starts after you write on your Think Board X. Fire up the app and use the patent-pending image scan-and-enhance technology to accurately and quickly capture all of your notes and brainstorms. Then, beam them all to you favorite cloud services! \n            With optical character recognition (OCR) you can name your scans by adding double hashtags on each side of your title on the Think Board X. Then scan the page to transcribe the text between the double hashtags. (ex: ## Team Meeting ## will automatically label your scan to \"Team Meeting\")\n           Whether analyzing trends in your personal habits, tracking company goals, or creating alternative methods for student assessments, the Think Board X will allow you to review incremental change and stay on track!\n            In an instant, the Rocketbook app crops and enhances each page so your digital notes are more crisp and vibrant than the real thing.\n           Step 1: Find smooth surface and wipe it clean of any dust \n(For super smooth surfaces like glass, mist the surface with water prior to installing to ensure a bubble-free install)\nStep 2: Peel Think Board X off of the liner with the help of a friend\nStep 3: Stick to surface and smooth into place with a microfiber cloth (included)\n           \"It all started in my Babson College dorm room. I needed a space to write down business ideas and stay organized from week to week. However, I couldn't drill holes into the wall to set up a massive whiteboard or paint my walls with whiteboard paint. That's when Think Board was born - a dry erase film that was easy to install and remove, looked beautiful, and worked like a charm. I stuck the first version of our product to my dorm room wall to write down OTHER business ideas. After about 50 or more bad ideas, enough friends had come into my room saying \"Hanson, your other ideas aren't that great... but THIS thing... this is cool. Where can I get one?\n.... we launched our first Kickstarter in 2014 and Think Board was born!\" - Hanson Grant\n    Once shipped, you should receive a tracking number (please allow at least 24 hours for the tracking number to update).

But let\u2019s be honest \u2013 there are no good water guns around anymore. Squirting pathetic water streams after minutes of pumping? That's not what water guns should be like in 2018.  \nWe think that the water gun has the potential to become so much more. This is why two years ago, we set out on a mission: to completely reinvent the water gun \u2013 and take water fights to the next level.  \nThe water gun revolution is already on the way\n You would like to write or post about Spyra One too? Find our press and media kit here!\nSimply pull the trigger and feel the powerful shots. Each water bullet is exactly 30 ml \u2013 about the size of a shot glass. There's no need for paint or target vests to find out who hit whom: the water bullets leave clear water marks on your friends' shirts. Let them fade after a few minutes in the sun and get ready for a rematch! \nCombining range with precision for the first time. If you're older than five, water fighting is as much about pure range as driving is about just getting there. So Spyra One not only matches the range of the top water guns on the market. Its patent-pending valve-nozzle technology also achieves a previously unknown precision: Instead of soaking, Spyra One's water bullets clearly hit their targets at up to 7.5 meters \u2013 that's as far as the laws of physics allow! \nNo protection needed \u2013 it's just water. Because of our specifically engineered valve-nozzle technology, Spyra One requires only low pressure levels to achieve maximum precision and range. You don't need any protective gear to start a fight wherever there's water around.  \nRefilling becomes part of the game. With the push of a button, Spyra One refills the entire tank with water \u2013 25 shots in 14 seconds. Gone are the times where the break to run into the house and refill your tank was the killer of every water battle. With Spyra One, counting your water bullets and refilling strategically becomes part of the fight. \nRefill anywhere, from any water source. Spyra One's pumping system is protected by a water filter, so you don't have to worry about small parts damaging the internals. Just hold the front end of Spyra One into any clean water source \u2013 a lake, a bucket, or your swimming pool \u2013 and push the button to let Spyra One refill the tank.  \nFull control down to the last water bullet. Stop guessing how much water you have left to launch that final attack. With Spyra One's digital display, you just know \u2013 down to the exact number of water bullets left in your tank. When you shoot, it counts down, and when you refill, it counts up again. This way, you never risk running dry in the worst moment.\nAlways know Spyra One's battery status. Spyra One's digital display also tells you when it's time to take a break from water fighting and recharge its integrated batteries. Don't worry: You will probably tire from water battles earlier than Spyra One does. The battery easily lasts for a full day of water fights with at least 45 refill cycles and 1125 shots.  \nFull pressure whenever you need it. Spyra One's integrated pump repressurizes the water automatically during refilling. The tank system then holds the pressure constant from the first to the last shot. Whether you have 25 shots left or just one, you always have full range and precision. All without any extra supplies like CO2 cartridges. And the best thing: There is no need for pumping anymore! \nNo more pumping. Ever. Did we mention this already? It's like magic. While your water fight opponents are still busy working out their biceps to build up pressure, you are 100% back in the game whenever you choose to. You can even interrupt the auto-refill process at any time, ward off attackers, and continue refilling.  \nPLAY\n\nHero Pack: Be the water gun revolutionary this world needs. This is your chance: Choose your own Spyra One and make water fights great again! \nBattle Packs: Pick your favorite friend (or opponent) and get the fight on. Prove your bravery in the eye of cold water with a Fighter Pack of Spyra Ones in your team colors!\nEscalation Packs: Planning a mutiny at that other department at work or a 'different' surprise for your best friends\u2019 wedding? We can\u2019t think of better use cases for these packs. Gather your two football teams and get ready for total escalation!\nColors and shipping\nColors (red/blue): We send out a survey for the colors after the campaign ends - you can pick any combination of colors you like. Example: For an Epic Battle Pack (8x Spyra One), you can choose 6 red Spyra Ones and 2 blue Spyra Ones in the survey.\nShipping: To find out the shipping cost for your country, choose your reward and select your country. Larger packs are more efficient \u2013 so it really pays to find a friend to back Spyra One with you! Through a special service provider deal, we managed to get local rates for both US and central Europe! Yay!\nYou, the community, already pushed this campaign farther than we ever thought possible. We have asked ourselves: maybe we can do even more together? And yes, we think we can! We asked you what your wished were, and carefully deliberated what is possible.  \nWith your help, we decided. If we reach those funding levels together, we commit to deliver the following:\nPOWER SHOT [UNLOCKED!]: The option to release an extra-powerful water bullet after holding down the trigger for a few seconds.\nEXCLUSIVE COLOR: Your Spyra One becomes available in Kickstarter Green. Exclusive for backers, and never available again!\nLOCKED: Stretch goal reached at: \u20ac666,666 (about $775,000)\nSHOULDER STRAP: A modified design that allows to attach a shoulder strap for more comfort in extended water fights and transporting Spyra One.\nLOCKED: Stretch goal reached at: \u20ac888,888 (about $1,025,000)\n\nWhatever happens on the way \u2013 we will keep you informed. Building a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. As we have done in the past on our Facebook page and our email list, you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated on our status and potential delays at least one update per month on Kickstarter.  \nSebastian Walter, Founder of Spyra\nHaving grown up with the 1990s' iconic water guns, Sebastian was shocked to not find any decent models anymore when he was preparing for a rubber boat party in 2015. Disappointed about the state of the industry, he started working on his own vision of a great water gun on nights and weekends.  \nWhen the first prototype was built a few months later, Sebastian decided to put everything on one card. He quit his job as a product designer at a German car manufacturer and set out to build the best water gun in the world. \nIn total, it took more than two years and six generations of prototypes to arrive at a pre-series, feature-complete design prototype of Spyra One. The next step is clear: series production of the Spyra One \u2013 with your help. \nThe modern water gun was invented by NASA engineer Lonnie Johnson in 1990. After two years of developing the Spyra One, we know why: Making water bullets fly through air is, literally, rocket science. Small amounts of accelerated water shot through air are subject to water turbulence and air resistance. The result: spraying.  \nTo achieve Spyra One's range and precision, it was necessary to optimize the valve-nozzle system for laminar flow. This was Dominik's job: the Air and Space Engineer tested countless nozzle shapes, over and over again, in our own 9-meter-long test channel.\nRocket Scientist Dominik implementing a new test setup\nTurning of differently shaped water gun nozzles\nSetup of the nozzle at the test channel\nTesting a nozzle in Spyra's shooting channel\nMeasuring range and spread of the water bullet after 8 meters\nBuilding a water gun in 2018, we can make use of electronics that would have cost a fortune back in the 1990s. The possibilities opened up by modern electronics and software engineering enabled us to implement central features like the integrated pump, the digital display counting your water bullets and a highly efficient electronic trigger-valve system. All of those drastically improve performance and take up less space than their mechanical equivalents. \nArduino-controlled first garage-built prototype\nSoldering the circuit board for a 2018 prototype\nTo maximize the fun you can have with a water fight, range was important but not by far our only focus. We asked around and found that the biggest pain points in previous water guns were #1, cumbersome screwing and refilling and #2, endless, biceps-wracking pumping to build up pressure.\nAn integrated, electronic pump that auto-refills and auto-pressurizes was therefore a must-have for the Spyra One. We tested for pumping speed, sound emissions, and battery efficiency, and ended up with a great pumping system. Watch how Sebastian demonstrates the convenience achieved by Spyra One's pump-tank system in our final prototype: Auto-refill and constant pressure, with no pumping at all. \nPLAY\n\nSince Spyra One is electronically controlled anyways, it was only logical to use that to your advantage with a status display. Now your water gun always tells you exactly how many shots are left in the tank. It's great for strategic gameplay \u2013 and honestly, it's just pretty cool.\nAn early prototype of the digital display\nTesting the display in the final prototype during refill\nWe did not test in the lab alone. You \u2013 the community \u2013 were with us from the start: as roommates who indulged our endless messing with water in the apartment ...\nPLAY\n\n ... Or as testers who subjected the prototypes of our patent-pending technology during trial water fights in our own arena. Watch this fun video we shot for our social media channels where Spyra One competes against two regular water guns in the test arena outside our headquarters:\nPLAY\n\n10 people for building a water gun? When we started building the Spyra One in 2015, we would have never guessed that three years later, the project would evolve into a company that would occupy 10 team members in engineering, marketing and business.  \nWe are here for you!

If all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production in schedule and ship Spyra One to you next summer. \nWe have done our part \u2013 now we need you! Kicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As an independent startup company, we can only get it done with your help. That is why you are so important to us: Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering a Spyra One, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship the Spyra One.

Stick the mount onto any flat surface and eufyCam\u2019s ready to go\u2014in less than a second; or just stick it directly onto most metallic surfaces.\nPlace eufyCam anywhere you want surveillance.\n In developing eufyCam, we made it our priority to offer the longest battery life in the industry to ensure a convenient and top-notch wire-free experience. So it only made sense that we partnered up with Anker\u2014the leader in charging technology\u2014to maximize the efficiency and charging speed of the battery.\nThis collaboration resulted in eufyCam having the power to run for 365 days (or 3 years in Standby Mode) per charge when actively monitoring areas such as your front door or driveway, not idling by in your attic.\nBirds, dogs, and falling leaves can trigger other security cameras into sending you false alarms. We understand that a security camera that sends you excessive false alarms will just be ignored, or even worse, unplugged.\neufyCam reduces false alarms by up to 95% by applying a 3-step scanning and filtering process. First, register your friends and family as trusted faces, then, once someone approaches the vicinity of your house, eufyCam can determine if that person is someone you trust to further reduce the alerts you get.\nAfter this triple-filtering process, eufyCam will send you a notification according to your security level preference, whether it\u2019s alerting you of all movements detected or only when a stranger\u2019s face shows up.\nAll this data processing happens in a flash, so you will be notified in seconds when a stranger is at your door.\n The 140\u00b0 wide-angle lens provides a panoramic view, spanning from your driveway to the front door\u2014with no spots missed\u2014making it ideal for catching people walking past or towards your home.\nTop-of-the-line Sony Exmor sensor combine with large f2.2 aperture to offer around-the-clock Full HD surveillance, recording sharp and bright video during the day, plus crisp and clear Night Vision footage in the evening.\nBased on 2-camera set and 30 days history review package for a year.\nDesigned to protect your home as well as your wallet, eufyCam is a one-time purchase that combines security with convenience. Paying for cloud storage should be an option, not a voluntary-but-mandatory cost to claim your security footage.\nBecause eufyCam records video to local storage, you\u2019ll have easy access to your footage from your smartphone. For Free. Just insert the included microSD card* and you\u2019re all set. Alternatively, by subscribing to our cloud storage plan, you can expand your security options to include simultaneous recording to the cloud.\n*Included 16GB microSD card, which you can expand anytime you want, records approximately 1 year of video on one camera, with 10 videos per day, 30 seconds each. \n*Cloud Storage optional for $2.99/month per camera.\nYour data is for your eyes only. That's why it's secured with AES 128-bit encryption. Access to your footage requires the microSD card to be inserted into the Base Station it\u2019s registered to, and you are logged on to the account tied to the Base Station. So that means you and only you can access the data. Not a thief, not your neighbor, nor anyone from the eufy Security team.  \nConstructed from cutting-edge ASA composite material, which offers unrivaled strength and protection against the elements, eufyCam works perfectly indoors and outdoors. Whether it\u2019s raining, a freezing -4\u00b0F (-20\u00b0C) winter or scorching 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) summer, eufyCam will keep watch over your home. \nThe built-in microphone and speaker provides you with direct communication\u2014via your smartphone\u2014to the door. Whether you\u2019re at home or out, speak directly to whoever walks up to your home.\nOpen the eufy Security app and your smartphone becomes a window for high-resolution streaming of what eufyCam sees in real-time.\nMore Capacity - by packing in more battery capacity into the camera \nBetter Power Management - by using advanced battery technology from Anker \nLess Consumption - by utilizing HybridWave technology for 70% less energy consumption  \nThe DNN (deep neural network) algorithms that eufyCam uses are inspired by the human brain, which are designed to see patterns. By recognizing patterns, the DNN algorithms categorize the sensory data eufyCam receives to filter out irrelevant patterns, so only pertinent information is analyzed. \nOnce the patterns are analyzed and determined to be human, the facial-recognition engine kicks in to scan the faces to compare to the database to determine if you need to be alerted or not.    \nThe eufyCam will ship to backers in the U.S., Canada, and 28 European Union countries including the U.K. We will continue to review shipping options for our other backers and keep you posted of any updates. \neufyCam is built with the future in mind, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll continually develop peripheral products to work with the eufyCam system, starting first with our entry sensor. The eufy Entry Sensor can help prevent break-ins by sounding an alarm and sending you alerts when a door or window is ajar while you\u2019re sleeping, or out and about. Easily installed and monitored with the eufy Security app, the sensor can operate for 2 years with the included CR123 battery.\n To find out how to order add-ons, please read the April 19th entry on the Updates page.\n*Only reward backers can order add-ons. Add-on cameras and sensors can't work independently, need to work with eufyCam HomeBase. \n*One eufy Security HomeBase can support up to 16 eufyCams and up to 34 sensors. Every eufyCam add-on package comes with one magnetic mount and one screw mount.\nWe\u2019re planning to add support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT in the near future, via software updates. We\u2019re making eufyCam fully Alexa-enabled, so you can control it with your voice. By just saying \u201cAlexa, show me the front door.\u201d, Amazon\u2019s Echo Show, Echo Spot and Fire TV will instantly stream footage for you to see\u2014all hands-free.\nSupport for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT. \nSupport for geofencing. \nExtending the maximum recording time from 120 seconds to 300 seconds.\nSupport for RTSP streaming, so users can save footage to NAS. \nSupport for offline access on the mobile app so users can livestream from cameras and access/download past recordings from local storage when the system is offline. \nSupport for offline access on desktop computers (Windows and MacOS) so users can access/download past recordings even when they lose Internet access or our server goes under.\nPower adapter will be offered in 3 configurations according to your postal address: U.S./Canada plug, U.K. plug and E.U. standard plug.\nWe are a team of engineers and designers motivated by making life more convenient. We believe that hassle-free, effective monitoring of your home shouldn\u2019t be a luxury and, more importantly, should be a service you trust. That\u2019s why eufyCam was incubated with Anker Innovations to offer unrivaled battery life, topped with other key features from existing security cameras and cutting-edge functions that enhance the usage experience.

After the Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant and the Galerie des Machines in 2007, the Carrousel des Mondes Marins in 2012, the Herons' Tree is the third phase of Les Machines de l'\u00eele. Coming out of the minds of Fran\u00e7ois Delaroziere and Pierre Orefice, it will be located along the banks of the Loire river, a few meters away from the house Jules Verne spent his teenage years in and where Jean-Jacques Audubon grew up and drew his first herons.\n                                                  https://www.lesmachines-nantes.fr/  \nC\u2019est dans l'atelier de la compagnie La Machine que l'Arbre aux H\u00e9rons est con\u00e7u et construit par une \u00e9quipe d'inventeurs d'exception.

Together, their vision and skills help create these incredible machines-true architectures in movement.\nPLAY\n\nLa compagnie La Machine c'est aussi des spectacles hors norme \u00e0 travers le monde : Les Araign\u00e9es G\u00e9antes \u00e0 Liverpool, Reims, Calais, Nantes et Yokohama, Long Ma-le Cheval Dragon \u00e0 P\u00e9kin et Ottawa devant plus d'un million de spectateurs.\nLa Machine company  also create larger than life shows around the world that delight millions of spectators: The giant Spiders in the cities of Liverpool, Reims, Calais, Nantes and Yokohama: or Long Ma - The Horse-Dragon in Beijing and Ottawa.\n                                                           http://www.lamachine.fr/\nL\u2019Arbre est en acier, mesure 50m de diam\u00e8tre et culmine \u00e0 35m. Il est surmont\u00e9 de 2 H\u00e9rons g\u00e9ants qui embarquent \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le une vingtaine de passagers pour un vol circulaire.\nLes 22 branches de l\u2019Arbre ont une longueur d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e de plus d\u2019un kilom\u00e8tre, dont 500 m\u00e8tres sont accessibles au public. Le v\u00e9g\u00e9tal s\u2019enracine dans l\u2019acier et le public a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 d\u2019incroyables jardins qu\u2019il d\u00e9couvre de branche en branche comme dans une succession de terrasses suspendues reli\u00e9es entre elles.\nCette Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel abrite \u00e9galement tout un bestiaire d\u2019animaux...\nThe Tree is made of steel, and measures 50m (165 ft.) in diameter and 35m (114 ft.) high. It is topped by two giant Herons that can, in turn, carry twenty passengers on a circular flight.\nThe 22 branches of the Tree are more than a kilometer (0.6 miles) long, half of which is accessible by foot. The vegetation takes root in the steel and the public has access to incredible gardens which they can discover branch by branch, like a succession of hanging terraces connected to each other.\nThis City in the Sky harbors a bestiary of mechanical animals.\nL\u2019Arbre sera implant\u00e9 dans une carri\u00e8re, un \u00e9crin de granit face \u00e0 la Loire. Son orientation plein sud lui conf\u00e9re un v\u00e9ritable microclimat. Que vous arriviez \u00e0 pied, en navette par le fleuve ou par le haut de la carri\u00e8re, l\u2019image de l\u2019Arbre s\u2019impose, unie avec les falaises du sillon de Bretagne dont la v\u00e9g\u00e9talisation naturelle magnifiera les jardins suspendus.\nL\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons fera de cette carri\u00e8re un des plus beaux \u00ab jardins urbains du monde \u00bb.\nBien s\u00fbr il y aura des interactions entre l\u2019Arbre, les falaises et le jardin. Le projet continue d\u2019\u00e9voluer !\nThe Tree will be planted in a quarry, a garden sheltered by granite cliffs, along the banks of the river Loire, where its south-facing orientation will give it a true microclimate. Whether you arrive on foot, by boat or from the top of the quarry, the Tree\u2019s image will impose itself, and the cliffs and their vegetation will magnify the Tree\u2019s hanging gardens.\nThe Herons' Tree will turn the Chantenay quarry into one of the most beautiful \u201curban gardens\u201d in the world.\nOf course there will be interactions between the Tree, the cliffs and the garden. The project continues to evolve !\nImaginez un enfant de 9 ans install\u00e9 sur le dos du H\u00e9ron. Devant lui, la t\u00eate du H\u00e9ron se d\u00e9coupe dans le ciel, ses yeux bougent, le bec et le cou sont mobiles. \u00c0 droite et \u00e0 gauche, il peut voir les 2 grandes ailes de l\u2019oiseau battre lentement pour contr\u00f4ler son vol. L\u2019enfant vole, il sent dans la machine chaque battement d\u2019ailes et fait partie de l\u2019animal...\nLes visiteurs de la Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel assistent \u00e0 toutes les phases du vol qui magnifient l\u2019animal et la machine. Ce voyage est encore plus fou que l\u2019embarquement dans le Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant !  \nPicture a nine years old child on the back of the Heron. The Heron\u2019s head stands out against the sky in front of him, its eyes move, its beak opens, and its neck moves. On each side he can see the bird\u2019s two great wings gently flapping in the air to control its flight. The child flies : he feels each wing beat; he is one with the bird.\nThe visitors of the City in the Sky witness every phase of the flight which glorifies both the animal and the machine. This trip is even wilder than riding aboard the Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant !\nDepuis l\u2019ouverture des Machines de l\u2019\u00eele en 2007, nous \u00e9tudions un \u00e9cosyst\u00e8me propre \u00e0 l'Arbre par le biais de la branche prototype, d\u00e9j\u00e0 foul\u00e9e par plus de 4 millions de visiteurs. Cette branche pr\u00e9figure l'une des 22 branches qui constitueront l'Arbre aux H\u00e9rons. Cela nous a notamment permis de tester la solidit\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la v\u00e9g\u00e9talisation de ces jardins suspendus. Les contenants qui accueillent les plantes permettent de planter des arbres au sein m\u00eame de l\u2019Arbre. Actuellement, nous exp\u00e9rimentons l\u2019implantation de micros paysages dans les fourches des branches.\nSince the opening of Les Machines de l\u2019\u00eele in 2007, we have been developing an ecosystem unique to the Tree using the prototype branch, which has been walked on by more than 4 million visitors so far. This branch prefigures one of the 22 branches of the future Herons' Tree. This has enabled us to test its solidity, the safety of its access, and the growth process for the hanging gardens. The planters we installed enable us to grow actual trees in the Tree. At the moment, we are working towards the creation of micro-landscapes amidst the forks of branches.\nDans l'Arbre aux H\u00e9rons, l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux jardins suspendus se fait gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 un escalier \u00e0 double r\u00e9volution situ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du tronc : l\u2019un sert \u00e0 la mont\u00e9e, l\u2019autre \u00e0 la descente. Le public emprunte les branches v\u00e9g\u00e9talis\u00e9es et les passerelles pour passer d\u2019une branche \u00e0 l\u2019autre et parvenir au sommet de l\u2019Arbre. Depuis les belv\u00e9d\u00e8res, \u00e0 30 m du sol, il d\u00e9couvre alors les H\u00e9rons, la Loire et Nantes. Le parcours dans les jardins suspendus se termine sur un bar-terrasse implant\u00e9 sur une branche basse. La capacit\u00e9 des jardins est de 300 personnes.\nL\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons est une machine de ville accessible \u00e0 tous. Comme pour le Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant sur sa piste, le public viendra librement le d\u00e9couvrir et observer cette Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel !\nIn the Herons' Tree, the hanging gardens are accessible via a double helix staircase located inside the trunk : one to go up, the other to go down. The visitors walk along lush branches and footbridges to go from branch to branch before reaching the top of the Tree. From the different galleries 30m (100ft) above the ground, they will discover the Herons, the river Loire, and Nantes. The walking circuit through the hanging gardens ends at a patio bar built into a lower branch. The hanging gardens can accommodate 300 visitors.\nThe Herons' Tree is an urban machine, accessible to everyone. Just like the Grand \u00c9l\u00e9phant, visitors will be free to discover and observe this City in the sky !\nTous les animaux qui peupleront l\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons sont construits dans l\u2019Atelier de la compagnie La Machine. Ils seront \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le en exp\u00e9rimentation dans la Galerie des Machines et test\u00e9s par le public jusqu\u2019en 2021. Nous continuons un travail de recherche et de construction pour enrichir ce bestiaire m\u00e9canique.\nDepuis le 10 f\u00e9vrier de cette ann\u00e9e, une grande maquette au 1/5e de l\u2019assemblage tronc, branches, \u00e9tais et racines est pr\u00e9sente dans la Galerie et les premiers \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la voli\u00e8re m\u00e9canique sont \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir : un colibri g\u00e9ant butinant une fleur ainsi qu\u2019un vol d\u2019oies sauvages.\nEn 2022, les visiteurs d\u00e9couvriront tout au long de leur balade dans les jardins suspendus, d'\u00e9tranges animaux m\u00e9caniques qui vivent et s'animent dans l'Arbre : fourmis et araign\u00e9e g\u00e9antes, chenilles arpenteuses, insectes, mammif\u00e8res ou encore rongeurs et bien s\u00fbr des oiseaux m\u00e9caniques. Pendant ces 4 ann\u00e9es de la construction de l'Arbre, nous vous ferons d\u00e9couvrir la trentaine d'animaux qui peupleront la Cit\u00e9 dans le ciel !\nAll the animals which will inhabit the Herons' Tree are built in the workshop of La Machine company. One after the other and until 2021, they will be showcased in the Galerie des Machines and tested by the visitors. We are moving forward with our studies and constructions to enrich this mechanical bestiary.\nSince February 10th of this year, a big 1/5 scale model of the assembly of the trunk, branches, support beams and roots is being showcased in the Galerie des Machines, as well as the first elements of the mechanical aviary: giant hummingbird harvesting a flower, and a flight of wild geese.\nIn 2022, visitors will discover, as they walk in the Hanging Gardens, strange mechanical animal living in the Tree : ants, a giant spider, inchworms, insects, mammals, rodents and mechanical birds. During the 4 years of construction of the Tree, we will show you the 30 animals which will inhabit the City in the sky ! \n                                    L'araign\u00e9e dans la Galerie des Machines ( par Morvan Frangeul)                                                      Spider in the Galerie des Machines ( by Morvan Frangeul)\nPLAY\n\nA partir de 10\u20ac, vous recevrez le titre de copartage num\u00e9rique de l\u2019Arbre aux H\u00e9rons en HD.

Showcasing 7 brand new designs by cutting edge artists worldwide, the Micro Wallet is our slimmest, strongest design yet. Not only that, a portion of every pledge will go to support the artists collaborating with us. Join us in our mission to put beautiful art in every pocket.\n \nMicro Wallet is as small as a card when closed, yet fits up to 8 of them easily. A simple yet intuitive clam-style opening allows you to store and access your cards on-the-go with a flick of the wrist.\nWe know you carry around some bills as well, so we designed an all-new cash compartment. And yes, it fits all kinds of bills.\nMicro Wallet starts out at just 0.3mm thicker than a standard credit card. We challenge you to find a slimmer wallet.\nMicro wallet is made from one continuous piece of Tyvek\u00ae smart material with RFID seamlessly integrated into the fold which makes it virtually unrippable and highly resistant to wear & tear all while keeping your private electronic information safe from theft. Apart from being super-durable, the Tyvek\u00ae we use for Micro-Wallet is also water-resistant, so rain or shine, you know you\u2019re protected\nDon\u2019t worry about loading up your Micro Wallet with cash, cards, receipts, notes, or whatever else you fancy. It\u2019s paper thin, but still expands over time while remaining beautiful and never compromising durability.\nWhen closed, Micro Wallet keeps your private data safe from electronic theft. The 360-degree RFID protection is built in so you won\u2019t even notice it. Where did we fit it all in? Well, that\u2019s our secret.\n        Choose Any Designs. Exclusive Packaging. 30% Off Retail. Share the love with some people you love.\n \n   Paperwallet was born out a of desire to fuse function with design and comfort in our everyday carry accessories. In 2015 we launched our first Kickstarter campaign for the Slim Wallet followed by the Magic Coin Pouch. Thanks to our amazing backers and supporters, over 100,000 people worldwide are enjoying our products everyday.\nWe\u2019ve listened closely to what our customers were missing and what they wanted - and designed the Magic Coin Pouch to be the ultimate minimalist solution for coin and cash. Here is what our customers are saying about the Magic Coin Pouch and Slim Wallet.\n   We are extremely grateful for the support we\u2019ve received from our crowdfunding community.

Unexpected issues may arise and if they do we always deal with them with our customers\u2019 satisfaction at the top of our priorities list.\n \nIn short, we know what we\u2019re doing and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will.

We promise to put our energies and focus to ensuring customers satisfaction, product quality, and meeting deadlines.\n\nLogistics:\nOne challenge we have considered is blasting past our funding goal and coping with a large direct-to-customer delivery.

Mark II is a hands-free smart speaker to get answers, play music, and handle all the little details in life, all by voice.\nWhat sets Mark II apart? It\u2019s open source. This means your personal data stays private, you can customize your experience, and Mycroft is a neutral player in the voice game, allowing you to be confident in your personal preference of apps and skills. More than this, the Mycroft platform is created by a community of innovators, keeping the technology honest and well-rounded.\nConversations captured by voice assistants in 2017\nAn Open Voice Assistant For Everyone  \nAI and voice technology are too important to our collective future to remain the property of the Silicon Valley giants. The Mark II by Mycroft is the device challenging them. Driven by community development, it\u2019s the only voice assistant that respects your privacy, is entirely transparent in how your data is processed, and is customizable. It\u2019s the voice assistant for the people by the people, doing all the things you\u2019ve come to expect from a voice assistant, but in a transparent and open way.\nOur open software gives you certainty that your private spaces stay private. Unlike voice assistants from Big Tech, Mycroft doesn't mine your data, sell you products, or try to own your online life.\nThe Mark II Smart Speaker\nThe Mycroft Mark II is the next generation open smart speaker. It sounds better, hears better, and incorporates all of the lessons learned from the Mark I.\nThe Mark I was very much a device for makers and open source developers. The Mark II is a consumer-ready speaker designed for you and your family, whatever your level of technical expertise. But at the same time, it is open hardware and software for you developers, makers and hackers.\nIt has state of the art features like array microphones, beamforming, active noise cancellation, and a bright screen to display important information. It also sounds great, filling your room with vivid highs and deep lows.\nWith a new design, high quality screen, multi-microphone array, and high quality stereo speakers, the Mark II enhances any space. Expect an FCC and CE certified Mark II, a multi-country power adapter, and a quick start guide when the Mark II arrives.\nSecond fabric color chosen by a community vote.\nNew Design\nMark II features a sleek, friendly design that can be placed anywhere in your home. Showcase it or let it blend into its environment, it\u2019s your choice. Mark II was built from all the feedback and community contributions since the launch of Mark I. With an increasingly smart stack behind it, the hardware got a massive overhaul.\nThe Screen\nSometimes seeing is better than hearing. Wouldn\u2019t you rather see the weekend forecast instead of listening to a string of 3 numbers in a row? The Mark II\u2019s screen is designed to enhance the voice interaction with a simple and clean user interface. This is helpful for skills like timers, calendars, and weekly forecasts.\nImproved Hearing!\nThe Mark II will be able to hear you even when you\u2019re across the room, or your music is turned all the way up. When you need perfection, you partner with the best; based in Silicon Valley, Aaware, is a leader in designing microphone arrays that eliminate interfering noise and preserve speech with little to no distortion.\nThe microphone system consists of an array of 6 individual microphones that when combined with Acoustic Echo Cancellation, Noise Reduction and Beamforming are able to isolate the speaker even in a noisy environment.\nBeamforming takes the input from the 6 microphones and locates the direction from which the user is speaking, giving it superior listening ability.\nRoom-Filling Sound\nThe upgraded speaker makes your music, podcasts, and everything in between sound great. Mark II users can expect crisp, encompassing sound. To achieve this, we are using a 10-watt speaker design with dual two-inch full-range drivers. To improve the performance of the drivers, we are using a ported and dampened sound chamber.\nSkills\nThe Mycroft community has built more than 140 skills with no end in sight. Skills include everything from creating shopping lists, to playing music, to telling jokes. Mark II users can discover skills by asking \u201cwhat\u2019s new today\u201d, or through our weekly updates to the community, or website. \nA key differentiator for Mycroft is that the skill list is infinitely growing, thanks to our robust developer community. They\u2019re building skills that serve everyone\u2019s needs; not just for the corporation behind them. In addition to standard skills like weather updates, timers, and music, you\u2019ll find ones like:\nCommunity-contributed skills are a key part of the Mycroft stack and we\u2019re proud to have hundreds of developers working to submit new skills and updates virtually every day.\nFor Developers and Makers\nWe didn\u2019t leave our developers and makers behind. The Mark II has special features that make hacking and customizing easy, not to mention thorough documentation and a community to lean on when building. Support for our community is central to the Mycroft mission.\nThe Mark II will have:\nFull sized USB port allows transfer of files and I/O \nAccessible SD Card slot allows for easy update of software\nSpecifications\nXilinx quad-core processor\nFar-field 6-microphone array \nHardware AEC, beamforming and noise reduction \nStereo sound with dual 2\" drivers (10W) \n4\" IPS LCD touchscreen \nUSB Type A \nMicroSD card slot \nBluetooth in \nWifi \n3.5mm audio out \n18W power supply with international adapters\nWhat You Get\nMark II, Power Supply, Quick Start Guide\nFCC and CE certification: The Mark II will be FCC and CE certified; meaning it\u2019s safe for consumers and won\u2019t run into issues in customs.\nPower adapter country compatibility: Using Mark II outside the US? The power adapter is international, working for the US, EU, UK, as well as AU.\nLanguages: What language does Mycroft speak? Right now it\u2019s English. But our community has been steadily working on Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, and German.\nShipping Details: Shipping price is calculated when you select the reward. We\u2019ve contracted with EasyPost to ensure that shipping is streamlined. From accurate calculations, door to door tracking across the globe, and their customs pre-approval process, your Mark II will arrive without a hitch. Just a reminder, some foreign countries require duties and taxes that can't be pre-paid.\nDesign is a product of research and non-stop iteration. We\u2019ve gathered feedback from our current users, interviewed voice assistant owners, and created hundreds of concepts. With the assistance of the community, we\u2019re building an open device for everyone. Thank you to all our members contributing their time, recommendations, and their testing to make this happen!\nWe realized one of the most critical pieces of a hardware project is to partner with the right teams and the right expertise. We are excited to have great partners to help us bring Mark II to life. We\u2019re working with a premier engineering group, Aaware, to bring their specialized knowledge in microphone and audio technology expertise to the engineering of Mark II.\nDuring the development of Mark I, we built relationships with manufacturers across the globe. This experience taught us the difference between good and great manufacturers, and how to spot the difference early on. For the Mark II, we are utilizing the top tier component supplier Avnet, to ensure our components are the best fit for our design, and leveraging their partnerships to qualify the EMS before production begins. \nOne of the biggest challenges in any product launch is the shipping and logistics, and trust us, we learned a tremendous amount through our first campaign. We are excited to announce EasyPost as the official partner of Mycroft AI on our Kickstarter campaign. Not only do they provide door-to-door tracking on all shipments, including international, they are actually saving the backers almost 20% on typical shipping costs. We are passing that directly to you!\nThe Mycroft community is using machine and deep learning to build an assistant that improves over time and learns how to better serve you. We're incorporating ML into every step of the user interaction from wake word processing to speech synthesis. And it\u2019s all being open sourced.\nThe data being used is generated by Mycroft users who have explicitly opted in to share their data to our open data set. Unless users explicitly opt-in, we delete data as soon as the interaction is completed. We are using machine learning in many different ways:\nWake Word Spotting: The Precise library listens to the environment and ignores everything but the wake word. Our default wake word is \u201cHey Mycroft\u201d, but users can customize it to fit their needs. \u201cHey Pedro\u201d, \u201cVictoria\u201d, and \u201cJarvis\u201d are all popular community wake words.\nSpeech-to-Text: For users who opt-in, we capture commands and make them available to improve the DeepSpeech STT software. We will move to DeepSpeech as our primary STT engine on March 31, 2018. \nIntents and Skills: Our Adapt and Padatious libraries use both known entity rules and machine learning to determine what the user wants to do. \nText-to-Speech: Our TTS synthesizer, Mimic, uses parametrics to synthesize voice. We are replacing it in the next couple of months with Mimic II, which uses machine learning and sounds significantly more human-like than other open source libraries.\nPrivacy\nVoice assistants from Big Tech know a lot about you. They know when you get home, how many people are in the house, what type of pets you have, and what your calendar looks like. Here at Mycroft, we\u2019ve got the only voice assistant that respects your privacy. We don\u2019t capture information about you, your family or your pets.\nWe don\u2019t store voice data: Other voice assistants on the market store every voice snippet they hear. At Mycroft, we delete the recordings as they come in, unless you actively choose to share your data by opting into our open data set. \nWe don\u2019t create targeted ads based on your interactions: The difference between us and the Big Tech Giants is our business model. We want to provide voice services to our members, the others have business plans around targeting you with advertisements or selling you goods and services. We don\u2019t create ads or sell your data to anyone who does. Our software is open so anyone can inspect the code and see exactly what we are doing with user data. This transparency ensures good behavior and creates trust between Mycroft the company and Mycroft the community.\nCustomization\nCreate a voice assistant that suits you. From its name to its voice, to its personality, we are creating tools that allow you to create an agent that represents you.\nPersonality: An anonymous black cylinder no more; Mycroft has a relatable, easy to interact with personality. To customize your Mark II, you can choose different home screen options such as weather and time widgets, or several friendly robot faces.\nCustom voices: You can choose the voice of your Mycroft, currently we support American Female and British Male voices with more coming soon.\nCustom wake words: You can further customize your Mark II by choosing between the wake words, Hey Mycroft, Hey Trinity, Hey Victoria, Hey Indigo with more coming soon.\nOpen Source Wins\nThe Switzerland of voice assistants; a neutral player in the tech ecosystem wars. We're not connected to any services. The recent media streaming/e-commerce feud between Amazon and Google left consumers out in the cold. With Mycroft, you never have to worry about the giants fighting over rights, we are a neutral player in the game allowing you to use what you want. We\u2019re the Switzerland of voice assistants, allowing users to choose the best application for their need; we have no strategic reason to funnel users into any brand\u2019s service.\nOpen code for anyone to contribute. You already know that being open source makes Mycroft customizable and transparent, but did you know open software breeds diversity? Building an AI that anyone can contribute to means making technology that is more representative of the world we live in today, a technology that is equitable, neutral, forward thinking.\nWhen we launched our Kickstarter in 2015, smart speakers were so new that most people had never heard of one. Fast forward two years and nearly 20 million households have a voice-activated speaker. \nDuring that time, we've made huge progress in partnership with a passionate community of open source enthusiasts. Mycroft is running on laptops, speakers, and even automobiles. Our community has built more than 130 custom skills that do everything from locating the International Space Station to singing \"Raindrops and Kittens.\"\nSummer Interns\nWe went from a team of six to a team of seventeen and have now shipped the Mark I to 56 countries and 38 US states. We are well on our way to achieving our goal: an artificial intelligence that runs anywhere and interacts exactly like a person.\nAlong the way, we learned a lot of lessons about manufacturing time frames, vendor relationships, fundraising, customer service and design (read more on what we learned, and how we\u2019re navigating those challenges this go round in the FAQ section). The feedback from those lessons is central to the Mark II.\nWe are so excited to be covered by a diverse array of publications and support from our corporate partners. Here are just a few.\nSome of our partners and supporters. We're humbled by their support.\nMycroft has been featured in the press!\nMark II Demo \nPLAY\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any hardware project there are things that we cannot know for certain. Parts can fluctuate in price or become difficult to source. Unforeseen issues could arise during the manufacturing, and final testing that may require more time or redesigns. Since we have been here before, we are doing our best to account for these circumstances in our timeline.\n\nAlthough we have one successful Kickstarter project under our belts, and we learned a tremendous amount about the process and expectations, there are always risks with building a product. Especially hardware. \n\nHere are some risks, and how we are mitigating them:\n\n1. Electronics Design: Electrical Engineering and PCB design is never a seamless transition from idea to final product. We started this process back in August of 2017 and partnered with some great companies to help us navigate the electronic component obsoletion and scarcity. We have tier 1 components with backup components for this, but if you know anything about the electronic component game, you know that lead times can go from 2 weeks to 26 weeks overnight. We have filled out intent to purchase with the major components to ensure that stock is reserved for our Mark II.\n\n2. Manufacturing: In our first campaign we picked a manufacturer that gave us all the right answers, but couldn't deliver a quality product on time. We went back and forth with them to rework their boards four times. This created a longer than anticipated delays in shipping. This time around, we are working closely with the Aaware and Avnet to qualify and test the final assembly manufacturers. \n\n3. Shipping and Logistics: This is one of the biggest challenges for our first campaign due to inexperience with international shipping. For the Mark II, we are partnering with an amazing 3PL to do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to shipping and customs clearance. Over 80% of the shipments are expected to clear customs before they land in the destination country, by filing all the correct paperwork regarding CE and FCC regulations. Please note that VAT and other country-specific taxes are not able to be pre-paid. These taxes, if applicable, will be ones that the destination country will reach out to the backers individually to resolve.\n\nRest assured that we have been thinking about all of the challenges we faced in our first campaign, consulted with other creators and industry experts, to come up with a well-prepared game plan for Mark II. Our goal is not to just sell you something, our goal is to have you enjoy the product, and help bring AI to everyone!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "SHIPS IMMEDIATELY!

If you tap the brake lever the distance between Microlights and rim changes which can be detected in the lights (even without braking). A double-tap is our signal for the blinker: If you double-tap the right brake lever the rear lights detect the signal and via bluetooth to the front lights- so that lights on the right side are blinking. Correspondingly this works on the left side. \nNavigation\nNavigation is similar to the turn signals - but here you are guided and need our Smartphone App for navigation: Lights are controlled by the navigation app and start to blink on the left or right side when you have to turn left/right. Put your smartphone in your bag and let the lights guide your way.\nSpeed Data Transmission  \nThe smart Magnic Microlights are equipped with a Bluetooth LE microcontroller which easily detects the rotation speed of your wheel from the incoming current. Via smartphone or Bluetooth LE compatible speedometer  you can receive speed data for display or further processing. This feature replaces Bluetooth LE speed sensors which have the same function but need extra mounting and extra batteries.\nCrash detection with emergency call  \nThis feature requires some future development and is still theory. In case of a crash generators will stop abruptly. We need some test data but we are confident to be able to detect a crash situation reliably which can be sent to the smartphone in order to make an emergency call. \nConfiguraton for Stand light and more  \nWe will offer different stand light patterns which can be set via Smartphone App. Additionally it will be possible to switch the internal orientation of the lights (for example for correct turn signals if your left and right brake levers deviate from standard installations).\nMedia Coverage\nGerman TV Report on Magnic Microlight Prototypes\nIn September a German TV team visited us and made this report (only available in German)\nPress articles\nChip: Physikalisches Ph\u00e4nomen: Neues Fahrradlicht funktioniert ohne Batterie und Dynamo\nCloudBT: Stay bright on your bike with Magnic Microlights\nvelomotion :Magnic Microlights: Winzige Fahrradbeleuchtung ohne Akku oder Dynamo\nelektrofahrrad24.de :  \"MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS\" STRAHLEN MIT UNSICHTBAREM, KABELLOSEN DYNAMO\nvelobiz.de: Bei einer Million Euro schalten Magnic Microlights das Licht ein\nbiopianeta/ IT: MAGNIC MICROLIGHTS: LE LUCI INTELLIGENTI PER LA BICICLETTA\ngreenMe / IT:  Le luci per la bici che sfruttano la frenata per illuminare senza batteria\nurbancycling/ IT: Magnic Microlights.

(to be continued)\nMore articles about our technology are on the Magnic Light homepage You want to write an article on our campaign? Here are some images (will be extended) which are free for press articles.  \n\nTechnology\nThe core part is the world\u2019s smallest contact and frictionless bicycle dynamo, that is integrated together with the electronic and the lighting system in the brake shoe of a calliper brake. The worldwide patented technic developed by the German company Magnic Innovations is based on a eddy current induction: a magnetic wheel in a generator separated from the bicycle rim by a narrow air gap induces temporary magnetic fields even in non-magnetic aluminium bicycle rims when the bicycle rim is moving. This leads to the magnetic wheel rotating contactlessly as if by magic.\nPLAY\n\n Neither batteries nor external cables, further fittings or spoke-magnets are necessary. Solely the brake shoes are to be exchanged for microlight - brake shoes, so that the maintenance only involves the exchange of worn brake pads after thousands of kilometres. The included brake pads are compatible with other standard brake pads of other manufacturers as available in every cycle shop. \nEddy current\nThe key is so-called eddy current technology : Energy is drawn from the rotating bicycle wheels without any physical contact, and thus without friction. Instead, eddy currents created by strong magnets generate electricity to power the lights: When the wheel spins, magnets inside the generator induce eddy currents with corresponding magnetic fields in the wheel, which in turn interact with the magnets in the generator. The resulting electricity will power your lights indefinitely without any environmentally harmful batteries or cumbersome cables.\nWhile the previous larger Magnic Lights were equipped with two LEDs (one for stand light) Magnic Microlights have just one LED which is fed by ultra-high efficient Mosfet rectifiers. \nHere you see an open rear light (generator part) for basic rearlights. For the standlight & smart version a lot more electronic components will be added on both sides of the PCB boards.\nTimeline\nAwards \n Whilst the previous Kickstarter-version \u201eMagnic Light\u201c gained several design, function and environment awards such as the GreenTec-Award, the German Design Award or the ISPO-Award, the initiator Dirk Strothmann received the Bike Valley Innovation Award for the 20 gram light new development that was handed over in October by cycling legend Eddy Merckx at the Euro-Cycling XP exhibition in Maastricht.  \nInnovation Award for Magnic Microlights handed over by 5x Tour de France Champion Eddy Merckx\n  Magnic Microlights on the road\nSome more facts and news can be found here below:\nMagnic Microlights- Additional information\nJust exchange your old brake pads and don't worry about biycle illumination any more! \nSome important things about Magnic Microlights: \nThese are the smallest (contactless) rim generators and work for all metal rims without any additional components: (no batteries, no cables, no extra adapters, no mechanical friction and nearly no deceleration) \nThe brake shoes are compatible with standard brake pads (Shimano and other brake pads can be used, too).\nMagnic Microlights are NOT compatible with Maguara HS11/ HS33 . This might be part of a strech goal.\nWhen the brake rubber is worn down it can be exchanged separately\nThe disc brake version rim is fixed by a special clamp holder. \nThe \"Smart\" version has additional functions: \nIntegrated speed measurement for use as a wireless sensor for speedometers with Bluetooth LE (You no longer need a sensor on the fork or a magnet on the spokes for wireless speed control because the speed signal directly comes from the brake shoes)\nUse as a turn signal without switches on the handlebar - simply use the brake levers: Turn left front- & tail light into flashing mode by two short taps on the left brake lever, accordingly, control the flashing to the right side easyly with the right brake lever. (The turn signal function does not work for disc brakes). \nControl different stand light flashing modes via smartphone - Read speed and distance data via smartphone app - Use as navigation indicator (in combination with smartphone route planner) \nWhile the low-cost standard version is manufactured in a robust plastic housing, the housing of the \"Smart\" version is made of aluminum.\nHow much energy do Magnic Microlights consume?\nPLAY\n\nEnergy consumption is less than 0,3 Watts per light (in average) at 20 km/h. You can't feel the difference when cycling.\nSafety\nWithout lighting, cyclists risk their lives in the dark - but those on the road with battery lights will soon be left in the dark when the journey takes too long or the batteries are no longer full. For those who do not want to mount heavy dynamos, use batteries or lay cables, we've launched two Kickstarter projects with our non-contact Magnic Lights, which feel like battery lighting without having to exchange or change batteries. Magnic Microlights can't be turned off at daylight and we are convinced this makes sense from a safety point of view: With lights on your visibilty increases significantly which means a great deal of safety.\nDaylight cycling with or without light?\n1 Mio \u20ac Funding Goal  \nIn order to be transparent and to be able to produce and deliver high quality products at moderate customer prices we decided not to fool backers by telling we could handle this High-Tech project with a low budget. At the moment it may seem unrealistic to reach the goal but we are confident to reach it by getting more and more public attention- and in the course of the project we received external third party requests which may close the gap in case we miss the goal.  \nWhat does this mean for the backers?  \nThese are the options:  \n1) Goal is reached -> Rewards will be delivered  \n2) Goal is not reached ->  \na) If 3rd party closes the gap all backers will be informed and can decide if they want to confirm their chosen reward. (This might be a 1- week Kickstarter short project with 1\u20ac funding goal, amended by a preorder part for backers of the limited rewards in our own shopping system - just as an example) \nb) If the gap can't be closed no money will be drawn from your account and no rewards will be delivered. \nWe do our best to reach option 1. At the moment probabilty for option 2a) seems higher but even in this case you as a backer of this campaign have the advantage to receive Magnic Microlights much earlier and at a lower price.\nThe Malawi Edition   \n  Staff of the Kindle Organization with Magnic Light Material\nWe are launching a collaboration with an orphans organization in Malawi (one of the poorest countries in the world): Kindle Orphan Outreach. The idea might look daring but we have very good friends from Germany and Malawi who have returned this summer to Kindle after one year here in Germany and will help to make this adventure a success story. We plan that young adults do the assembly of the \"Magnic Microlight - Malawi Edition\" in the rooms of the Kindle Organization. This Malawi version which will be part of the crowdfunding rewards. Economically this is possible because the small size and weight of the components allows to ship goods with moderate cost and the basics are given: Rooms with electricity + internet connection - and the most important: motivated people who will have a new perspective. For us it will be possible to pay employees much more than the usual incredible cheap salary in Malawi and we will be able to invest in education and infrastructure because the same work is much more expensive in Germany.\nIf you choose a Malawi-Edition reward please not that you will have to wait at least 3 months longer for your reward than for the German version. We hope for your understanding.\nOur Team\nFamily team\nDirk Strothmann (Management, CAD & Software Design,...)\nJ\u00f6rn Strothmann (Hardware Tests & Design)\nAntje Strothmann (Photo and video recordings, Shipments)\nLisa Strothmann (Aerial photo and video recordings)\nOur partners\nDevelopment and production of Magnic Lights strongly depends on our partners. Here is the list of our partners and coworkers:\nVTS Elektronik Gmbh, F\u00fcrstenau /GER  (Electronic Circuit Design, PCB Board Design & Automated/ Roboter PCB Board Assembly), Coil Winding & Assembly\nHAICHENG MOLD, Shenzhen /CHN  Tooing & Injection mold processing\nShenzhen Hill optical technology ,CHN , Lens development & production\nFlanders Bike Valley : Bluetooth Integration & Test Environment\nJ\u00e9ssica Carri\u00e7o, 3D animations   \nPayment without Credit Card/ Bezahlung ohne Kreditkarte\nUnterst\u00fctzer aus Deutschland k\u00f6nnen auch per Lastschrift bezahlen. Finanzierungsbeitr\u00e4ge werden erst bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung nach Ablauf einer Zwei-Wochen Frist abgebucht.\nBesteht ein Risiko, wenn das Projektziel nicht erreicht wird?: Nein- Nach Projektende wird der Betrag nur dann eingezogen, wenn das Projektziel erreicht wurde.\nFAQ\nDo Magnic Microlights fit to my bike?\nYes- if you have \"Standard\" rim brakes (Caliper, Vbrake, Cantilver brakes). Even for disc brake systems we have a clamp adapter solution- but this is just for light and does not provide brake light and turn signal functionality.\n Do Magnic Microlights work with Carbon rims?\nNo- we need a metal rim. Aluminum is best. Magnesium works, too.\nI want to have a different combination of lights than offered in the rewards (for example 3 Basic Sets). Is this possible?\nYes- We have added a \"Custom Set\" reward. Choose any combination of rewards (except the 1\u20ac reward) and add the prices. Enter this amount + shipping cost and you will receive the desired combination. After project termination you will receive a survey where you can specify yoour desired combination.\nDo I have to exchange brake pads often?\nNo- \"Normal\" cyclists exchange their bicycles more frequently than the brake pads because these usually last for more than 5000 kilometers. Hardcore bikers have to exchange the brake pads from time to time.\nIs it possible to program the lights via Smartphone?\nYes- It might be necessary to \"tell\" the lights that the rear brake is controlled be the brake lever on the left side (and not on the right side as usual) and vice versa. You can override the standard setting and reconfigure your light via Smartphone Bluetooth connection.\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith two successful Magnic Light Crowdfunding campaigns we have proven that our technology works as promised and that we are able to handle production and shipment. In the meantime we have received several awards worldwide patent grants for the Magnic Light technology. For the Magnic Microlights we are faced with new challenges:\nMass production in much higher quantities than handled by us before + Cooperation with more co-workers for tasks we did ourselves in the past\n\nWe have analyzed production steps and risks carefully and don't want to promise more than we can deliver. This means that we can't promise to deliver before next summer. For the Smart version we have to extend our current software which can be done in a few weeks but we can't send out without intensively testing the new features. This means that delivery of the Smart has to wait until late autumn.\n\nIn the past we have seen that small mistakes can cause big problems and delays. We are strongly dependent on our suppliers and even if we have managed to find good partners with reliable high quality production we can't exclude mistakes in the production chain completely. These can cost a lot of time and money and therefor the production will be increased step by step to minimize these risks.\nIn the project plan we have taken into account delays due to initial mistakes but it is clear that this is an estimation based on our previous experiences. We will communicate all production steps via Kickstarter updates in detail.\n\nDue to setup-work the shipment of the Malawi-Editions will take at least 3 months longer than shipment of the standard versions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dirk Strothmann\n4 created \u00b7 11 backed\nFrom bioinformatics research at the university I switched to freelance software development - with more time for our children.

But most of the time, these hurt. At Antonia Saint NY, we believe that you should have beautiful shoes that make you feel great. That\u2019s why we make essential heels and flats that look classic on the outside, and feel like sneakers on the inside.    \nCreated to be a gorgeous, classic shape to compliment absolutely anything in your closet, our shoes softly hug your feet with a hidden SoftSurround System\u2122 so that you feel supreme cushion with each step.\nInstead of sacrificing beauty for wearability, or accepting the pain of beautiful shoes, we have carefully re-engineered high heels and flats to give you the high-quality support you deserve.\n  Every well-loved shoe starts with finding the perfect fit. To provide you with shoes that are more personalized to fit you, we have a Fit Profile\u2122 and Fit Kit\u2122 to obtain your measurements and find your closest matching shoe. Once we get your measurements, our team will carefully customize your shoes to fit *you.*\nWe are offering this customized service to all Kickstarter backers as a thank you for helping us get started!\nAt Antonia Saint NY, we believe that you should no longer be held back by something as simple as your footwear. If you\u2019re going to fulfill your dreams, you can\u2019t have part of your brain focused on the pain that you feel. You can\u2019t break a glass ceiling with a glass slipper - and we\u2019ve got lots of glass-breaking to do! - so it\u2019s high time to Free the Feminine and Her Feet.\n      We have created a truly modern shoe for the modern world. We have thought of all the ways in which we wished flats and heels would feel, and how we wished they would wear over time, and we spent the last two years bringing them to life.\n    We have a patent-pending SoftSurround System\u2122 that gently cushions and supports the entire foot. \nMade up of three distinct parts listed below, we also created these shoes to be some of the most durable you\u2019ll ever own.\n   *Our Essential Flat comes with the same technology, with slight modifications.\nEveryone needs an essential black heel and an essential black flat in their closet. They go with everything and make anything look great. It\u2019s like having that perfect little black dress, but for your feet.\nFor those of you who want to ease back into wearing heels on occasion, or simply love flats, the flat is an absolute game-changer. And for those of you who must have that go-to heel, we\u2019ve got what you need. (P.S. The heel stands at 3.5 inches but feels MUCH LOWER due to the triple-cushion insert design, and overall technology)\n  Imagine wearing your favorite running shoes...\nIt feels fantastic. The combination of the plush interior that surrounds you, and the soft, flexible materials used throughout, makes this the most cushioned classic shoe you\u2019ve ever experienced.\n  Finally, you can have a high heel that supports you in moving through life instead of just looking pretty. You now have three shoes built into one: Instead of wearingone pair to work, one pair at work, and one pair after work, feel confident you can make it through the entire day and night with one pair of beautiful shoes if you want to. You can:\n  Don\u2019t just listen to us. Hear from a few of those who have actually tried our shoes.\n  PLAY\n\n  PLAY\n\n   Making shoes that fit *you* requires some extra thought and care, but you\u2019re worth it. You are unique, and there are no other two feet exactly like yours.\n  Think about it: Does one of your shoes pinch more than the other? Or does one shoe move on your foot? Or worse, even fall off when you walk?\n  With our split shoebox that arrives to you as a complete set, you can receive the perfect size for each individual foot. No other shoe company is doing this, and we\u2019re proud to be the first.\n  We will send you a Fit Kit\u2122 during the survey process to determine your size once the campaign closes. However, here is a general idea of size below, and remember, we will take your measurements for EACH foot.\nIf you don\u2019t see your size here, we still want to make them for you! Please back this project so we can grow as a company and make it possible to create the sizes you need. Please also write to us in the comments with your size preference! We want every one of you to find freedom in your footwear.\n\nTake a look at how other shoes perform over time in comparison to Antonia Saint NY.\n  Check out what you can save when you buy these well-made shoes. There's an old saying \"buy cheap, and buy twice\" and we know that to be true.  \n  Hate to say it, but you need to know (in case you haven\u2019t figured it out yet) - the industry is a RACKET. Too often we fall for beautiful shoes that only hurt us. One study found that we have BILLIONS of dollars of unworn shoes sitting in our closets because of how painful they are known to be after just a few uses.    \nPLAY\n\n  Become a backer of this project and pick a reward. This allows you to PRE-ORDER the shoes before they are made. You will not only receive your shoes before anyone else in the entire world, but you will get a special backer discount only available on this Kickstarter campaign here. \nWant to buy more than one pair of shoes, or a few pairs in different colors? Check out all rewards, help us spread the word so we can offer more colors, and get friends to order with you, so you can save money the more you bundle.\nAfter the campaign is over, the Victoria Heel will retail for $295, and the Jane Autumn Flat will retail at $225. The Reward Cost at the top of each reward is the price you will pay for the shoes. AND don't forget - you are also receiving a FREE ($70 value) Custom-Fitting service ($35 per shoe with skilled technicians to custom-fit your shoes to EACH of your unique feet!), as a THANK YOU for helping us get started here on Kickstarter! Join us NOW because we will never have this incredible offer again! \n        Antonia Saint Dunbar creates solutions for women and others who need them, and most often, products that are in industries dominated by men with minimal innovation. For her first company THINX, she led the design and wrote the patent for the period-proof underwear while also doing all operations of the company as COO for many years.\nTHINX went on to be named TIME Magazine's \u201cTop 25 Best Inventions for 2015,\u201d Entrepreneur Magazine's \u201cTop 100 Most Brilliant Companies of 2016\u201d and Fast Company's \u201cTop 50 Most Innovative Companies in the World of 2017.\u201d THINX also makes activewear, reusable tampon applicators and organic tampons, and every product comes with a giveback that empowers girls around the world. Her second company, Icon, makes products for incontinence and helps fund the Fistula Foundation.\nThe idea for Antonia Saint NY came when walking to the THINX HQ in New York City and feeling pain in her feet. Similar to when she was working on creating THINX, it was her father\u2019s DNA as an industrial designer that came alive inside of her.\nCalled a \u201cFeminist Genius\u201d by the press and nominated to Women 2.0\u2019s \u201cTop Founders to Watch,\u201d Antonia is now focused on the women's shoe industry to create products that address both form, and function. She also Co-Founded The Brooklyn Shoe Factory to have a home for the custom-fit orders she will create in the U.S., with a focus to grow jobs as the company scales.\nBoard-certified Podiatric Surgeon Dr. Suzanne Levine is the official advisor to Antonia Saint NY, and one of the Most Influential Podiatrists of 2017 by Podiatry Magazine. She is a highly-regarded instructor, Co-Chair of the International Aesthetic Foot Society (iafs.com) and Co-Founder of Institute Beaut\u00e9.\nA self-proclaimed shoe addict, Dr. Levine was inspired by her elite and celebrity-driven clientele to provide a solution for the ongoing effects that come from wearing the designer stilettos we all dream about. After creating several inventions of her own to address high heel pain and other types of shoe problems, she tackled the root of the issue, the shoe itself, and partnered with Antonia Saint Dunbar for Antonia Saint NY. \nThis is a fitting role for Dr. Levine, as the aristocrats of Manhattan commonly refer to her as the \u2018Podiatrist in High Heels\u2019 and she has been a candid supporter and a passionate advocate of women not having to sacrifice optimal foot health for the sake of their undeniable sense of fashion.\n As a leading expert and author at the forefront of podiatry with a revolutionary resolve to \u201cprovide pain-free beauty,\u201d she has become a favorite on various shows including Good Morning America, The Dr. Oz Show and The Today Show. Over her career of 30 years, Dr. Levine has seen more than 200,000 patients, and she has gained tremendous peer recognition as one of the most internationally acclaimed podiatrists in the industry.\nWe are incredibly fortunate to have a team of more than 25 people working with us to help bring this dream to life for all of you. We have the expertise of production partners, consultants and shoemakers, and here is the team who works in New York City every week with Co-Founders Antonia Saint Dunbar and Obed Moses Cepeda.\n  When Antonia launched THINX on Kickstarter, it opened up an international community of early supporters who went on to be growing markets of the company for the years ahead. Kickstarter is also all about innovation. We feel the Kickstarter community is a great place to introduce our technology to the world at large.\nWe will be using these funds to create our first production orders of shoes, including all the tooling, molds and components that these complex designs need across many sizes! The more money we raise, the more we can make for all of you! \nWe will also be helping to create more jobs in America with all custom-fit orders being fulfilled in our Brooklyn Shoe Factory, so thank you so much for helping this dream come true for us, and for everyone who would benefit from shoes like this! \n       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe feel confident that we can fulfill these orders in the time specified, but there are always things beyond our control. \n\nThis is not our first product launch as this is Antonia Saint Dunbar\u2019s second Kickstarter project and fourth company (after co-creating THINX, Icon and The Brooklyn Shoe Factory). For THINX, Antonia did all management of the campaign personally (launched on Kickstarter in 2013 and now selling to millions of fans around the world at www.shethinx.com) all of the customer service, and managed all orders from an active website simultaneously. \n\nAntonia also led the production of THINX, found the right partners to help launch the company, and has gained extensive experience with how to manufacture high-quality goods and fulfill orders. We've navigated through completely unexpected issues and always kept our communication channels with customers open and active so that you always feel connected to the company that you are helping launch! \n\nThe one thing we will be working on through this process is getting the custom-fitting process down perfectly. This may take some additional adjustments, but we are dedicated to finding the solution everyone needs. \n\nIn short, we know what we're doing, and you can feel confident we will fulfill our promise to make you classic shoes that feel like sneakers on the inside, and in your size! \n\nIf any unforeseen issues come up, we will share them with you, our cherished backers, and solve them with our highly capable team of 25 people who are dedicated to making this company a success.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain, and have a lot of confidence that we can make what we say we'll make, when we say we'll make it. However, sometimes the shipping or flown partners don\u2019t agree and they get stuck for some time, or our factory has an issue with machinery that slows down production. We add to our schedule time for these kind of things, but sometimes it's not enough. Again, if this happens, we will let you know and solve the time delay as quickly as possible! \n\nActs of God: We're based in New York City and our goods need to be shipped to our warehouse or our factory in Brooklyn to be custom fit. If weather gets crazy or we get held up in customs, we will let you know. And whatever happens, we'll get through it together.

Watch this video to learn about the importance of preserving diaries, the focus of the Museum\u2019s first-ever Kickstarter campaign. \nWe\u2019re thrilled by the response to this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for cataloging and digitizing over 200 Holocaust diaries and translating and transcribing three of them. \nAfter reaching our $250,000 goal we\u2019re excited to announce a new stretch goal: An additional $50,000 to translate and transcribe 10 more diaries. Back this project today to help Save Their Stories!\nPLAY\n\nThis is no ordinary map.\nUS Holocaust Memorial Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nIt\u2019s a deeply personal illustration of one family\u2019s harrowing escape and survival during the Holocaust. It\u2019s included in a diary\u2014one of over 200 diaries the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has in its collections waiting to be cataloged, translated and published online.  \nWe\u2019re in a race against time to do this specialized, expensive and time-consuming work, and we urgently need your help.  \nWe know first-person accounts are powerful. Most people are familiar with the diary of Anne Frank, and her personal account is often the first introduction that many have to the devastating history of the Holocaust. But it\u2019s not the only diary of its kind.  \nEach of the diaries in our collection has an important story to tell, of suffering and strength, persecution and perseverance. Written by people young and old, from diverse backgrounds and countries, they bring to life a broad spectrum of individuals\u2019 experiences during the Holocaust. Now, in the face of growing Holocaust denial, we must bring more stories to light before we lose the firsthand memories of survivors and witnesses who can shed light on the context of these diaries and other priceless artifacts in the Museum\u2019s collection.  \nAs the survivor generation passes, it is our responsibility to make sure their voices live on so that their experiences will not be forgotten. You can be a part of preserving history: Back this project and Save Their Stories.\nFor this project, we'll catalog, preserve, and make available online over 200 Holocaust diaries in the Museum\u2019s collection -- for the first time ever. The handwritten pages and notes are in 17 different languages and will need to be transcribed and translated into English. While we would love to raise enough funds to complete the translation of every diary, reaching our project goal will enable us to translate into English three diaries written by Jewish refugees who fled their homes to escape the Holocaust:  \nThe diary of Joseph Strip, a young boy who wrote about his family\u2019s harrowing experience over the grid-lined pages of his math notebook. \nThe papers of Lucien Dreyfus, a journalist and schoolteacher from Strasbourg, France, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1943. His collection includes letters to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who escaped to the United States in 1942.\nThe diary of Hans Vogel, who fled Paris with his family while his father was interned, which contains hand-drawn and colored maps of their journey. \nEach of these three diaries will be published in its entirety online so that people everywhere can view the original pages and read the translations. Like Anne Frank\u2019s personal record, these stories expose the truth of Holocaust history -- so that ever more researchers, authors, teachers, students can learn from them and help fulfill the promise of Never Again. \nHere is our estimated timeline for this project:  \nSummer/Fall 2018: Cataloging complete for all 200+ diaries \nWinter 2018: Digitization complete for all 200+ diaries \nSpring 2019: Collections for all 200+ diaries published online at ushmm.org  \nSummer 2019: Translations and transcriptions for 3 feature diaries added to ushmm.org collections listings\nThe Museum has collected millions of pages of historic documents containing details on the individual experiences of Holocaust victims and survivors. Although we are committed to making our entire collection available online, the sheer size of it makes this a lengthy, expensive project. \nEach additional first-person account or piece of evidence made available on the Museum\u2019s website--which is visited by millions of people every year--has the potential to reveal a new aspect of Holocaust history or highlight its relevance to the world today.\nThese three are just some of the many accounts we hope to bring to the public:  \nJoseph Strip (formerly \u201cStripounsky\u201d)\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nJoseph Stripounsky awoke early on the morning of May 10, 1940, to the sounds of aircraft and gunfire. The Germans had invaded his town of Antwerp, Belgium. He was just 17.  \nJoseph fled with his parents and younger brother, leaving almost everything they owned behind. He carried with him a math textbook and two math notebooks, one of which became his diary.  \nThey joined thousands of others heading south through France, making a slow and arduous journey with very little food or money. In France, they spent a year trying to get farther away from the ever-encroaching Nazis. They managed to secure American visas through Joseph\u2019s father\u2019s employer and finally landed in New York in May 1941\u2014just six weeks before Joseph\u2019s 18th birthday, when he would have been legally required to stay in France.  \nJoseph tells the story of his family\u2019s harrowing exodus through everyday details and extraordinary sketches.\nLucien Dreyfus\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum, Gift of Monique Allen\nLucien Dreyfus was a dedicated journalist and professor of modern languages in Strasbourg, France. In 1940, anti-Jewish legislation was passed in France, and he was dismissed from his teaching position because of his faith. \nAs persecution against Jews intensified, he fled his town and sought safety in southern France. Refuge did not last long. In October 1943, he and his wife were arrested and just one month later, they were deported to Auschwitz and murdered. \nLucien had kept a diary since 1925, but his writing became more frequent during World War II, recording the realities of day-to-day life, the experiences of his students, and what he knew about Jewish persecution in other parts of Europe. \nHis diaries also contain deeply personal messages he wrote to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who were able to escape France in 1942 and eventually made it to the United States. Lucien knew he might never see them again, but continued to write with the hope that they would receive his diaries. Miraculously, they did years later. \nHans Vogel\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of Eva Vogel\nAt the age of seven, Hans Yakov Vogel fled Germany with his parents and elder brother in 1936, settling in Paris where they remained until the outbreak of war. His father was separated from the family and interned by the French as an enemy alien at Lisieux, and later at Gurs in the south of France. In May 1940, just 24 hours before the invading German forces reached Paris, the rest of the Vogel family fled south. They traveled among a stream of other refugees, mostly by foot, as the Luftwaffe shot machine guns at them.  \nThrough the help of friends, the Vogels were reunited and settled in Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the unoccupied zone near the Spanish border. They remained there from June 1940 until April 1941, when they received papers from the United States Consulate allowing them to immigrate. They arrived in New York via Lisbon on the steamer Nyassa in August 1941. Two years later, Hans Vogel died at the age of 16 from an illness.  \nHans kept an extraordinary diary of their flight, including photos and hand-drawn and colored maps tracing the family's journey from Germany through France and eventual immigration to the United States.\nYour pledge doesn\u2019t just get you access to behind-the-scenes updates on the work (and often the discoveries made) during the process of cataloging, translating, and publishing these stories.

I\u2019m a Los Angeles-based writer and director of online shorts (like Old/New, Real Gone and Plot Device) and branded content for clients like Bad Robot and Red Giant. I created the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool for writers like me.\nOoh Aah, That's How It Always Starts\nIn my experience, I've found that the second best part of writing is the beginning (the first best is finishing), when inspiration strikes and it feels like someone is beaming the story to your brain from an alternate dimension.\nYou're not so much making it up as transcribing it, relaying it. Your ideas at this point are like tribbles, growing and growing off of each other.\n...Until they're not.\nThe transmission eventually stops, and you're left with a pile of disjointed and half-baked ideas. And now it's up to you to turn them into a story.\nNow just turn this mess into a story. No bigs.\nCut to: the Storyclock Notebook.\nPicture Your Story Like a Clock\nThe Storyclock Notebook utilizes the simple method of visualizing your story like a clock.\nSeeing your story this way can quickly give you a bird's eye view of it, and reveal where your gaps are.\nThere's a gap.\nAnd rather than filling these gaps by making stuff up and dropping in ideas from the outside, you can extract ideas from what you already have -- using symmetry.\nWhat\u2019s happening on the opposite sides of the clock? Anything you can set up or pay off?\nIt's a simple and effective exercise to fill the gaps in your story with relevant and meaningful material, born from what you already have.\nThis doesn't mean Lawrence Kasdan wrote Raiders with a story clock, but it demonstrates that good stories have a \"rhythm and rhyme.\"\nA Research + Development Tool\nThink of the Storyclock Notebook as a research and development tool. The first half of the book is devoted to studying and analyzing existing stories, with the second half devoted to developing your own. \nThis is a Development page. The left is where you dump your brain, and the right is an empty clock to start laying out your ideas in a narrative structure, and start filling out your story.\n   This is a Research page. Sometimes it helps to rip off-- er-- STUDY the choices of other writers, so we've devoted the first half of the book for clocking existing stories.\n Purpose-Built for All Kinds of Stories\nWe designed the Storyclock Notebook for screenwriters, but it works for other storytelling mediums, too!\nIt's not just for screenwriters!\nBuilt-in Resources\nOn the inside covers we\u2019ve put a bunch of storytelling resources to serve you in your quest.\nNerd stuff!\n  A general story structure guide and list of archetypes inspired by much smarter people like Joseph Campbell, Blake Snyder, and basically everyone at Pixar.\n  A page/time converter that comes in handy far more often than you'd expect.\nThe Design\nThe Storyclock Notebook was designed to be both practical and creatively inspiring, a tool for perspiration and inspiration. Something that makes you WANT a reason to use it. For this we ended up leaning on old industrial handbooks and research logs to find the look and feel.\nThe touch... the feel... of industry!\nThere are 12 Research Logs and 12 Development Logs, a couple pages in the back for miscellaneous notes, and a table of contents page in the front for easy referencing and filing of your endless ideas and research.\nPrinting the Notebooks\nGuten Co. letterpresses all of our covers in San Antonio, TX, where the Earth's gravitational pull is optimal for letterpressing journal covers.\nOur friends at Guten Co. will be letterpressing the covers of the notebooks at their studio in San Antonio, TX.\nGuten Co. was indispensable in the development of the Storyclock Notebook, helping us source materials and finish proofs so we could field test it and get as close to the finished product as possible before revealing it to the world.\nIf you\u2019re looking to letterpress anything (i.e. business cards, invitations, posters that say WANTED in huge letters) or want some sweet handmade ceramic goods (seriously, come on), check out Guten Co!\nBecause the binding process is tedious to do by hand, we will print the interiors and bind the notebooks together at a larger company in Nashville, TN, where we will also pack + ship them out to our backers.\nSpecs\n5.5x7\u201d Finished Trim Size; 52 Pages\nCover: Neenah Environment \u201cWeathered\u201d 110# Cover\nInterior Pages: 80# Cougar Text - Natural\nWho's Responsible?\nThe Storyclock Notebook was created by me (Seth Worley), designed by Micah Lanier, and produced by Anne Fogerty.\nTeamwork!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nJust gimme it.\nWell firstly, I really want this notebook. We\u2019ve had a small number of proofs printed over the course of developing this, and I\u2019ve ended up using it to write 2 feature-length screenplays, a tv pilot, 3 inspirational talks, 2 company presentations, and a wedding toast. Oh and a Kickstarter video.\nMaybe? Maybe?\nI feel like other people could benefit from this as much as I have, and Kickstarter is a great way to find out how right or wrong I am about that. After being involved in other friends\u2019 campaigns and backing several projects over the years, I\u2019ve been able to see and experience firsthand the unique benefits Kickstarter has over traditional development routes - the biggest being YOU. By releasing the storyclock notebook on Kickstarter, I\u2019m able to get your feedback and input before we ever print it, ensuring that by the time it makes it to your hand, it\u2019ll be the best possible version of itself.\nExtra Extras!\nAlong with the notebook, we'll be offering extra awesome tools and resources in higher tiers to help you on your story quest, including:\nVideo Tutorial - A short video from Seth to help you make the most of the notebook.\nWriting 101 Pack ($55 Value) - 11 videos from Seth walking through the basics of story structure, character, theme, and a comprehensive walk-through of outlining a story in the form of a clock.\nWriting 201 Pack ($60 Value, Pre-Release) - The highly-anticipated sequel to the Writing 101 pack, not-yet-released!\nSkype with Seth (Pricelesssss) - Get 30 minutes of Seth's time to talk about whatever you want.*\n*Mostly to talk about stories. Keep it PG (maybe PG-13 because Seth acts like a 13-year-old [not really (ok yeah kind of really)]).\nWhat Do I Get?\nWe've got several reward tiers to cater to your personal (notebook-related) desires:\nWhere is my money going?\nSince we\u2019ve already done most of the development of this notebook (believe it or not we\u2019ve been working on it for two years), your contribution will go towards:\nNotebooks - letter-pressing the covers in Texas, printing the interiors in Nashville, and binding the books in Nashville as well (because these are physical goods, every notebook purchased adds extra cost).\nReimbursement for Development Costs - We\u2019ve already spent money to get this off the ground (illustration costs, fonts, proofs, etc) and so this will help pay people for the work they\u2019ve done.\nFees - Kickstarter is awesome and because it costs money for them to operate we\u2019ll owe them some money. And also credit card fees. We factored all of this into our goal amount.\nWe chose $12,500 because we think that number will help us at least hit breakeven on the cost to produce these notebooks. If we bring in \u201cextra\u201d money - which depends on how many backers we have for each tier, we hope to include some fun surprise flavor for you when you receive your notebooks.\nWhere you at?\nYou can follow us on Instagram at @StoryclockNotebook, or follow me on Twitter at @awakeland3d.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've spent a couple of years developing this notebook, and we're super excited to be sending it out into the world.

Ultralight hardware lets you wirelessly control your camera with an intuitive iOS or Android app. And advanced machine learning algorithms help you get the perfect shot every time.\n With a single tap, you can activate Arsenal\u2019s settings assistant AI. The settings assistant is trained on thousands of great photos. It can determine the optimal settings for the scene you're shooting. Next it fine tunes those settings using 18 different environmental factors. The result is great settings for any shot.\n Like your own personal photography assistant, Arsenal lets you focus on the parts of photography you love while it takes care of the rest.\nArsenal lets you control your camera from up to 100 feet away. Set the shutter speed, aperture, and ISO, see a live preview, and trigger the shutter from your smartphone.\n Arsenal automates advanced photo stacking techniques to help you capture scenes with High Dynamic Range (HDR). In seconds, you can take multiple exposures and merge them into a single RAW or JPG file on your camera\u2014no post-production required.\n With focus stacking, you can get your entire scene in sharp focus. Arsenal calculates the optimal number of exposures, takes them at different focus positions, and merges them into one crystal clear image.\n With Arsenal, you can create long exposures that capture rich color and dramatic motion blurs...without buying expensive neutral density filters.\nWe love timelapses, so we designed the best timelapse interface on the planet. Set your parameters, then ask Arsenal to adjust the exposure in changing light for a smooth day-to-night transition. You can even preview your timelapse while it\u2019s being recorded.\nOnce you start your timelapse, Arsenal takes care of the rest. You (and your phone) can leave your camera working. Come back anytime to check on the progress or make adjustments while the scene is still being captured.\nCheck out some of the timelapses we've shot with Arsenal\nLet\u2019s face it, reviewing images on your camera\u2019s tiny screen is never fun. With Arsenal, you can review them wirelessly on your phone. Flip through photos instantly, zoom in to see details at full-resolution, then share favorites right from your phone.\nArsenal fully supports dozens of popular DSLR and mirrorless camera models made by Canon, Nikon, Sony, and Fuji. To see if your camera will be supported when we launch, visit our Supported Cameras page.\nArsenal controls your camera via a USB cable (included), and you control Arsenal wirelessly from your smartphone. Arsenal\u2019s free mobile app will be compatible with modern iOS and Android devices.\nArsenal\u2019s intelligent algorithm suggests settings based on your subject and environment. Then like any good assistant, it lets you control the final shot. Here\u2019s how it works:\nCompares current scene with thousands of past images using a convolutional deep neural network. (The same algorithm used in self driving cars)\nOptimizes settings based on 18 different factors\nAvoids settings that produce weak images on your specific camera and lens\nUses image recognition to identify subject-specific needs (e.g. fast shutter for birds)\nShows safe ranges for each setting based on situational constraints (e.g. vibration)\nGives you the ability to change the settings you care about most\n P.S.

I\u2019m a software developer, amateur landscape photographer, and the creator of Arsenal.\nArsenal started as a side project to automate my own photography techniques. Once I started showing other photographers the photos I was getting, there was so much interest that I decided to create something everyone could use.\nGetting Arsenal from idea to reality has been a tremendous team effort. I\u2019ve worked on it full time for more than a year in collaboration with an electrical engineer who specializes in device design, a brilliant user interface designer (who also happens to be my brother), and other key roles. Arsenal is now ready for production, and we\u2019re so excited to share what we\u2019ve built with the Kickstarter community.\nIf you\u2019d like to see some of the shots I\u2019ve been getting with Arsenal, you can find me on Instagram @ryanstout.\nProduct Walkthrough\nMore Info:\nArsenal website\nFollow us on Instagram / Facebook / Twitter\nSupported Cameras\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n-- Technology --\nFor a product like Arsenal, which introduces a new set of capabilities to the market, the immediate questions are, \u201cIs this technically possible, and can this team do it?\u201d \n\nWe decided that the best way to address this risk\u2014both for potential supporters, and for ourselves\u2014was to built it first, then ask for support. Over the last 18 months, we overcame all the major technological hurdles on our roadmap. While there is still plenty of work to be done (see roadmap section), it\u2019s the kind of work many others have done before.\n\n-- Software Development --\nWhen we started writing the code to power Arsenal, we didn\u2019t know how long it would take. Now that the software is functionally complete, we\u2019ve mitigated the timeline risk that net-new software development can entail. The remaining aspects are far more quantifiable in scope and timeline.\n\nAnother challenge we wanted to overcome was camera compatibility. We wanted to support dozens of popular camera models and give backers a clear answer on whether their camera would be supported at launch. At the same time, it was important to keep development and QA testing manageable. To accomplish this, we leveraged an open-source camera API to communicate with cameras. In addition to significantly decreasing the cost of supporting each camera model, it allowed us to identify in advance which cameras would support which functions. \n\n-- Manufacturing & Production --\nA challenge specific to hardware projects is finding a way to physically manufacture their product at scale. To mitigate this risk, we decided to design for commercial-scale production from day one.\n\nWe\u2019ve already begun lining up supply chain partners, and we\u2019re working with a firm here in the States to help manage the production. The supply chains break down into a few areas. 1) the PCB, 2) usb cables, 3) the case. We're working with a company here in the States to do PCB fabrication. We've found a few suppliers in China for our cables. The case will be injection molded here in United States, and assembly will happen here as well. We also have quotes from a few companies for custom packaging.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Stay in Touch", "descp": "Receive exclusive updates throughout the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["251 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "**Get Arsenal - Kickstarter Exclusive **", "descp": "Be one of the first to get Arsenal.

The large-scale production presents us as the developer with the challenge of ensuring a smooth and efficient manufacturing process. Our stringent requirements concerning all components guarantees the highest quality. To ensure this, we cooperate with professional and reliable German manufacturers.

Due to our competent partners, suppliers and logistics, we are convinced to fulfill the prerequisites to deliver the tex-lock to all our backers on schedule. If temporal delays occur in the course of the production, we will do our best to compensate for these in a timely manner without any loss of quality. As a backer you will be kept informed.

We tested several models and even broken glasses/screens.\nToday all options available on the market have many moving parts, connections, settings and use low-quality materials:\nTop sold phone mount for bicycles.\n  Our goal to develop Pully was based on 3 main requirements:\nNo moving parts or adjustments; \nEasily removable if needed; \nPractical use: just one hand. \nAfter 6 months of design and testing we got t the following result:\nPully Magnetic Phone Mount.\nThe most notable difference, compared with other models available on the market, is the size:\nSide by side.\n  A watermelon being pulled by the Pully.\n With a few grams of the magnet, we generated enough force to lift a 16lb watermelon. Most phones on the market weigh between 0.2 and 0.3lb.\nPully is waterproof and there is no need to remove it when parking outdoor. It was designed to go along the daily rush:\nOne-handed attach/detach.\n  Designed for everyday multiple use.\n  One of our main design criteria was to ensure devices would not be affected when exposed to the magnetic field, short or long term. After several studies, we conclude:\nThe vast majority of phones launched since 2012 has memory, display, processing, battery and touch-screen immune to changes in the magnetic field. Only phones that have the compass feature may have the function affected when close to Pully, but return to normal when distanced. GPS applications like Waze and Google Maps work normally.\nIf the magnetic field of the permanent magnet was about 85 times, the first affected component would be the speaker that could sound distorted when close to the magnetic field.\nWe were careful to use as little material as possible. It has 3 main components: magnet (1) a rigid plastic base (2) to fix the cylindrical structure of the magnet to the elastic (3) which embraces the handlebar.\nMagnets:\nThe magnet shape should be cylindrical so it would not interfere with the desired orientation by the drive: it can easily changed from landscape to portrait without any interference; \nShould be strongest magnet available on the market so you do not need a large mass / volume of the same, which would increase the cost of packaging and shipping. \nBase:\nIt must be hard to tightly fit the magnet. \nElastic:\nShould be adhering to the handlebar so Pully would not suffer any rotation on the handlebar; \nThe material should have good mechanical strength and, at the same time, be elastic for easy installation. \nPrototypes tested during the last 6 months.\nWe tested several prototypes of different shapes to get the most compact, practical and sturdy design. Development stages were:\nDrafts; \nTechnical drawing; \n 3D printing and prototyping; \n Machining of the final model; \n Injection mold design. \nWe selected Neodymium magnet at a N52 Class through the good relationship between attraction force with the mass required. It is currently the most powerful available on the market:\nMagnetic field in different magnets.\nThe material chosen for the base is ABS by it's high mechanical and impact resistance, good finish and injection characteristics. Only 4 grams of plastic are used per unit:\nInjection mold designed for Pully - ABS.\nThe silicone rubber bend was chosen by good resistance to weather variations, toughness and good adhesion to the handlebar. Pully is also compatible with cars and motorcycles:\nTrip mode: attached to the steering wheel.\nNotice: Pully is also compatible with a small magnet that comes in the box. You can attach it (3M adhesive) at any surface, including the car's dashboard.\nMotorcycle handlebar.\n  Weight: 35,0g; \nThickness: 14.0mm; \nWidth: 34,0mm; \nLength: 45,0mm; \nBase Material: injected ABS with glossy finish; \nElastic Material: 100% transparent silicone; \nMagnet Neodymium N52 Class;  \nExternal Magnet Thickness: 3.0mm; \nExternal Magnet Diameter: 20,0mm; \nAttraction Plate Thickness: 1.5mm; \nDiameter of Attraction Plate: 40mm; \nPackage Dimensions: 35x45x20mm; \nPackaging Weight: 50,0g. \nUpdate Notice:\nThe video was recorded with one of our prototypes. On the final model the steel plate (goes between the cover and the phone) will be thinner than the one displayed here. Plate thickness will go from 2 to 1 mm and the main magnet (inside Pully) will be 3mm thicker. We tested the new combination and it presented better results than the previous ones.\nWe have been testing the final prototypes everyday in the last 3 months. Also of strength and resistance tests were made to ensure the quality of the Pully even in various terrain and adverse situations.\nDespite the great magnetic attraction between the device and Pully, the secret to easily remove is this small rotation:\nSmall rotation to remove the phone.\n    Car passing over the Pully.\n    The elastic absorbs all vibration that would go to the phone if it was a 100% rigid structure.\n  Phone usability is not affected at any point (unless the \"compass\" app only while the cell is in the holder). GPS navigators (Waze, Strava and Google Maps for example) work normally.\nThe compass feature depends on the magnetic field of the earth, so it may have its precision affected while the phone is mounted on Pully. As soon as you separate both, compass goes back to function normally.\n   Inside the Box:\n1x ABS base with Super Magnet Neodymium N52;  \n2x transparent silicone elastic bends; \n1x magnet for external attachment point (car dashboard, for example) with 3M adhesive; \n1x large galvanized iron plate with 3M adhesive (for mobile); \n2x small galvanized iron plates with 3M adhesive (for other items). \nAll units will be assembled, packaged and shipped from our workshop in S\u00e3o Paulo/Brazil. Deliveries will take place in the order of each support.\nWe estimate we'll need two months after receiving Kickstarter funds to get all units produced, assembled, packaged and delivered.\nPully will be available on the market on March 2017 for the amount of $ 19.99 + shipping, two months after all the rewards were given.\nOne of the greatest difficulties to enable Pully for an affordable price is the initial investment cost required to manufacture the injection mold, approximately $2,000 representing 61% of the total campaign cost:\nInjection mold: $ 2,000 (61%); \nProduction and initial development costs: $ 660 (10%); \nCampaign production online marketing: $ 385 (10%); \nCost of cutting knives and package manufacturing: $ 375 (10%); \nKickstarter and Paypal fees: $ 300 (9%). \nRight after receiving the funds, we will begin the mold manufacturing and, in about five weeks, we'll start the production, assembly, packaging and deliveries.\nWe are proud to develop a unique product in the world. We hope that you can help us get this project role and provide the Pully to as many people as possible.\nTHANK YOU!\n:)\nVela Bikes Team\nAny questions, contact us:\nhello@velabikes.us \nwww.velabikes.us \nWhatsapp: +55 (11) 98147-1352\nLos Angeles - CA 90016", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur main challenge is to spread the word for most people as possible so we can keep the price low.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Only!", "descp": "Receive 1 unit of the Pully Magnetic Mount with -52% discount!\nFuture MSRP: $39.99\nINCLUDES:\n1x Unit of the Pully Magnetic Phone Mount.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers", "Limited (140 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 34 or more", "title": "Dual Combo - 2 Units!", "descp": "Receive 2 units of the Pully Magnetic Mount with -57% discount!\nFuture MSRP: $79.99\nINCLUDES:\n2x Units of the Pully Magnetic Mount.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 79 or more", "title": "5-Unit-Combo - Kickstarter Only!", "descp": "Receive 5 units of the Pully Magnetic Mount with -60% discount!\nFuture MSRP: $199.99", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 139 or more", "title": "10-Unit-Combo - Kickstarter Only!", "descp": "Receive 10 units of the Pully Magnetic Mount with -65% discount!\nReward destined to families, group of friends and bike shops interested in retailing.\nFuture MSRP: $399.99", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Early Bird!", "descp": "Receive 1 unit of the Pully Magnetic Mount with -77% discount!\nOnly 200 units available for the first backers!\nFuture MSRP: $39.99\nINCLUDES:\n1x Unit of the Pully Magnetic Phone Mount.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "Double Pully - Early Bird", "descp": "Receive 2 units of the Pully Magnetic Mount with -75% discount!\nFuture MSRP: $79.99", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "30 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "LAST CALL - FINAL SHIPPING!", "update_content": "Dear backers, \nIf if still have not receive your Pully, please let us know bellow.\nFor all backers who have already commented, sent us an email or a private message, DON'T WORRY, we have already included you on the shipping list.\nFor those who have not or had the shipping address updated, this is the last chance before summer to have it shipped.

Patent pending strength is built in.\n    How can Zubits be easy to step out of, yet stay on when you run?\nConsider that even with your regular shoelaces double-knotted, you can still step on your heel and squeeze out of your shoes because this action generates a lot of force. These forces are not present when you run. That\u2019s why your shoes stay on. When you run, the shoelaces are mostly lifting the weight of your shoe. Zubits are engineered to be incredibly strong for their size. Zubits can hold your shoe secure while running and jumping, but they will split open when you step on your heel because the forces are much greater. Zubits will also come in four strengths to match your size and use.\n Zubits Benefits\n               See reactions to Zubits from people on the street...\nPLAY\n\n        The final design will not have divots on the face as these prototypes do.

Heavy or stiff soled shoes like boots could make Zubits pop open incorrectly. Yet sometimes the construction of the upper of these shoes actually helps the Zubits stay closed.

Additional applications have been made for patents in Europe and the US.\nThe Result:\nWash a load of clothes in less than 15 minutes, with less than 7 litres of water!\n  PLAY\n\nDetails of the prototype\nFolded for Packing:  15 cm long (6\" long), 12 cm wide (4.5\" wide), 8 cm deep (3\" deep) Unfolded:58 cm tall (23\" tall), 19 cm base diameter (7.5\" base diameter) Weight:275 grams (10 ounces) \nLaundreez -- Folded for Packing\n Our Market\nGreat for washing clothes in so many situations.\nCollege Students -- save on trips to the Laundromats\nBackpackers -- forego searching for Laundromats.\nCampers -- avoid the wait while others use the campsite sink.\nCaravanners -- stop the struggle of washing in small sinks.\nSailors -- no need to head for dry land or calm seas.\nSkiers -- enjoy fresh thermals each day and save on packing.\nCyclists -- clean away dirt and grime without damaging delicate fabric.\nWork-out Enthusiasts -- pack sweaty clothes after a workout and wash in Laundreez ready to use the next day.\nDancers -- wash delicate leotards and tights.\nBaby Clothes -- clean baby's clothes separately from others.\nThe Future\nWith full funding we look to have Laundreez in production this Autumn.\nWe will make two slight changes to the bag and proceed with our first order.\nWe have negotiated a production run of 1,000 units with our manufacturer.  Although the cost per unit is higher with a small first production run, the total outlay will be less.\n*We are currently developing accessories and adaptation for the bag, such as Replacement caps which will transform the Laundreez into a trigger spray bottle, a shower or a watering can.\nLaundreez is a better alternative than your washing machine when you have a small load since it uses less energy and water, saving money and the environment.\nThe Laundreez will not only serve its purpose to clean clothes but also many more. It will become a household and outdoor necessity.\nLaundreez\nVolume/Weight if transporting water: 7.5 liters weighing 7.5 kilograms (8.0 US quarts weighing 16.5 pounds)\nOne load of clothes uses approximately 7 litres of water for washing and rinsing. Rinse water (usually around 3 litres) can be used to wash a second load. This makes Laundreez eco-friendly. By containing the dirty soapy water (not using a lake or a river to wash clothes) users can safely dispose of the water and detergent.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nProve market for Laundreez. \nObtain feedback from the community. \nDevelop interest in Laundreez. \nExtras\nDon't forget to like us on Facebook and share our campaign to help fulfill our goal!\nVisit our website for more details!  http://www.laundreez.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Laundreez prototype has been tested for over a year and is extremely durable.

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.coolest.com/countdown!\nA 21st Century Cooler? It's about time!\nRegular coolers are boring, break easily and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the ice. The COOLEST cooler is 60 quarts of AWESOME packed with so much fun you'll look for excuses to get outside more often.\nMaybe you want to use the built-in ice crushing blender to whip up some margaritas or smoothies on your next boat trip or tailgate?\nMaybe you just want to always have music on hand with the waterproof bluetooth speaker or want to recharge your electronics with the built in USB charger?\nWhat else?\nREWARDS:\nUPDATE:  Color Voting Complete! \nHere are the Final Coolest Color options. When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

But they only make one patty at a time and there is the problem of where to store the patties until you need them.\nSingle burger presses - not good enough\nINSPIRATION STRIKES!\nLast year we launched our first product, The Smart Cookie\u2122 (our first Kickstarter campaign), a storage container that shapes, stores and freezes homemade cookie dough.   We started experimenting with different uses for The Smart Cookie\u2122, such as flavoured butters, baby food, ice cream etc.  Then one day we put extra ground beef in The Smart Cookie\u2122 to make sliders for our kids.  After we saw how well it worked, we decided to create a version that would make full sized burger patties. We quickly realized the Burger Master:\n1) Makes eight burgers in less time than it takes to make one.\n2) Protects the meat from freezer burn.\n3) Allows you to keep your hands clean since you never need to touch the meat.\n4) Makes it easy to stuff your burgers with your favorites such as  cheeses, salsa or butter before sealing.\n5) Is a container that makes it easy to store and transport the burgers to their final destination such as a barbeque, cottage or the freezer. \n6) Doubles a cooler pack when frozen.\n7) Is compact and stackable in the freezer.  Dimensions are 10.6\" X 10.8\" X 1.25\".\n8) Is easy to clean and dishwasher safe.\n9) Allows you to easily remove the meat, even when frozen.\nWe decided to adjust our original design to be able to cut meat and to make it large enough to hold 8 quarter pound patties (well actually a little bit extra, 4.5 oz to be exact).  And as an added bonus, you never have to touch the raw meat with your hands!\nBurger Master superior design\nINTRODUCING THE BURGER MASTER\nWe decided on the name Burger Master because this product makes all other burger presses obsolete.  There is nothing else on the market that will shape multiple burger patties in one easy step, and also allow you to store the patties in a flat, freezer safe container that does not require any additional separation materials such as pieces of waxed paper or flat plastic discs.  The Burger Master is made from a durable food grade thermoplastic elastomer sourced from the United States.  It is BPA and Phthalate Free and remains flexible even when frozen which allows the patties to easily pop out one at a time as needed.\nWHAT WILL WE USE THE KICKSTARTER FUNDS FOR?\nSince our products are made from high quality materials, and also made in Canada, we really need to order materials and manufacture in high volumes to be able to keep the costs down to provide an affordable product to the end user.  \nWe already have experience bringing a product to market and are ready to move forward with the Burger Master.

Now, add a unique design that changes posture while adding long term comfort to extended periods of sitting at work or driving. This was the thought process behind the creation of Posture MD.\nFast Results\nSpend 30 minutes sitting at your desk or in the car and you will notice the small discomforts of the low back, upper back, shoulders, and neck. Lumbar supports are an incomplete solution. Full back support that fits in almost any chair is the answer.\n Our product offers a long term solution for comfort. You will be able to maintain good posture without effort on your part. The result is being able to sit and work comfortably uninterrupted by discomfort.\n - Restores natural posture to create long term comfort while sitting.\n- Lumbar pillows alone, do not address the needs of the rest of the back. \nUnique, Revolutionary Design\nPosture MD's revolutionary staged-wedge design keeps the users pelvis back while getting progressively wider where contact with the upper back is made. The patent pending convex-tech full back support allows shoulder blades to wrap around Posture MD. Simply sitting against Posture ME will create better posture .\nThe sleek design will compliment both modern and vintage chairs\nUniversal fit for all car and desk chairs\nThe Origins of Bad Posture\nPosture MD's team members work with many clients who spend the majority of their day sitting at work, driving, sitting at home, ect.... 9 out of 10 had a forward head, rounded shoulder, arching back look. The \"Hunchback of Notre Dame\" appearance.\n Create confident posture habits while you drive\nDuring initial screenings, client history's revealed the vast majority use some type of lumbar support. This made us start looking for a way to make a support that addressed the inadequacies of the ineffective lumbar supports.\n  One of our team members was sitting at their desk writing emails and noticed their posture had slowly crept into the very position most of our clients had when standing. \nWe went back to the books and using the principle of \"muscle memory\" began to create a solution for posture that was able to be used in the chairs people already owned (who wants to buy a whole new chair?). \nOur team wanted a solution without the user having to think about it...\"focus on work, not your posture\" We thought. \nYour Chair: The Culprit \nStandard concave chairs actually promote hunched over posture\n  We instructed a participant to consciously fix their posture and the team looked at how the chair lined up with the users body. Two problems arose:\n1) When sitting with good posture, the back of the chair had no contact with the users body\n2) Unless the user constantly made an effort to maintain my posture, they gradually slouched into poor posture as well. (Good thing they were only doing 30 minutes of emails per day, and not the average 9.3 hours of sitting.) \n Concave chair causes shoulders to round forward. Chairs with greater than 90 degree back to seat angle: low back rounds, slumped over.\nPosture MD: The Solution for Unconfident Posture\nMuscle has memory and when subjected to sitting in certain positions or postures for prolonged periods, changes the length of the muscle and alters posture. The body, operating in terms of efficiency, recognizes the body is in certain positions for prolonged periods and keeps the body in that position so no energy is wasted to get into a position.  Sitting against the Posture MD sets you into proper posture with no thought. Good sitting posture directly creates good standing posture. A more confident look leads to a more confident attitude.\n12 Months of Development\nOur 5 design and function goals\n  Original Drafting\nRough Protoyping for field testing\nFinalizing our design to every degree. Pouring our first dozen Units for final testing\n With our background in manufacturing, we have done extensive research, planning, and have tested production in temporary molds. With your support, we will be using the Kickstarter funds to make full production injection molds that are capable of making a quality and consistent product. The molds will be CNC\u2019d out of large aluminum blocks and supplemented with coolant line and a premium lubricant to maintain our precise design.  These will all be made in the USA and are expected to ship 10 weeks after we submit the initial PO.\nMichael Tunney - Manufacturing Engineer, Brendan Ridings - Corrective Exercise Specialist\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done extensive business planning, mapping out financials and timelines. As our design and engineering is completed, our production prototype has been tested and approved, and we have selected vendors for tooling, manufacturing, and distribution, we truly believe time is our biggest hurdle.\n\nDesign hurdle: leaner users felt pressure on the spine. This resulted in a change in design which took the contact points off the spine all together and placed more emphasis on the muscles next to the spine. An added bonus made the new contact points second as a massaging area on the back muscles.\n\nDesign hurdle:\nInitial design pushed the users hips too far forward making some users re-adjust their chair to accommodate Posture ME.\nWe increased the angle from hip contact point and upper back contact point which also made the user sit straighter. \n\nDesign hurdle:\nExperimentation of different duerometers of foam to achieve a long term, soft user feel while being able to maintain shape with extended use.\nTesting procedure included 1 year of use at a minimum of 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. Our team was able to create to the proper polymer blend that could maintain structural integrity while being comfortable all day.\n\nSimilar hurdles arose with our silicone based inserts. The blend created had to be soft enough for comfort but able to maintain shape and integrity with long term use.\n\nFinal dimensions are done. Functional prototypes are complete.

This is a nuisance for you and it is environmentally unfriendly. So, we created the EverDock Go and EverDock Dash with compatibility and beauty in mind.\nWhether you own an iOS or Android device like the iPhone, Samsung Galaxy series, HTC, Nokia, Blackberry, or any other smartphone, you can rest assured that the EverDock Go will charge your phone in style.\nNot only does the EverDock Go work with any phone, but it also fits in just about any car. Utilizing an ingenious locking disc, the EverDock Go mounts and dismounts from your car's cup holder or dash in just seconds.\nApple or Android and Everything Else\nRegardless of who makes your device or what cable it uses, the EverDock Go will provide you with years of enjoyment. If you upgrade your phone or even change to a new platform, your EverDock Go will be able to change along with you.\nWhether your phone uses a Lightning Cable, 30-pin cable, micro-USB cable, or even has a headphone jack at the bottom to connect to your car, the EverDock Go can accommodate your needs without a problem.\nAny Make. Any Model\nCars come in all shapes and sizes. Creating a docking solution that works in any car wasn\u2019t easy.  Over half of the states in the US have outlawed mounting devices to the windshield, so window mounts were eliminated.\nSo, we decided to focus on the cup holder and the dash. Mounting the EverDock Go inside the cup holder was a challenge we solved by using a small locking disc placed at the bottom of your cup holder. This same mounting solution works great on the dash version.\nUsing this ingenious mounting method, the EverDock Go and EverDock Dash stay firmly in place in any car yet they are easily removed with just a simple twist. \n***Verify EverDock Dash Fits in Your Vehicle\nDue to the differences in slopes of windshields and dash shapes and sizes, we strongly recommend you verify the EverDock Dash fits in your car. Please download the PDF and print it to 100% scale to verify fit in your vehicle. You'll probably want to allow about 1in or 25mm of room at the top so you can dock and un-dock your phone easily.\nThis is not necessary with the EverDock Go. The EverDock go is about the size of a soda can so it will fit in virtually every cup holder ever made.\nClick Here to Download Fit Template for EverDock Dash\nClick Here to Download Fit Template for EverDock Dash\nPLAY\n\nWith or Without a Case\nAfter launching the original EverDock, it became clear that people use a wide variety of cases. We wanted to accommodate those as well. So, the adapter has infinite adjustability on the vertical plane and four adjustments horizontally allowing the EverDock Go to accommodate virtually any case on the market. The EverDock Go will even accommodate cases as thick as the OtterBox Defender Series.\n\n\nElegant Design\nThe world's best products are clean and free from unnecessary parts and ornamentation. Screws and tools are a pain and often get lost.  Utilizing an ingenious adapter and cord management system, the EverDock Go allows you to install or change cables in seconds without the use of any tools or screws.\nWe researched the current offerings of stands and mounts for the car but were unimpressed with the cheap materials, the cumbersome installation and cords falling to the floor. With the EverDock Go, we insisted on an Aluminum top that exudes the same quality and high end look and feel of your phone and your automobile.\nNo screws, no parts to lose\nSimple Setup\nA good accessory is designed to enhance your experience with your device. If setup is cumbersome or difficult, your experience will be diminished. That's why we made the EverDock Go to be completely painless to setup and enjoy. Watch this short video below to see how simple it is to start enjoying your EverDock Go.\nPLAY\n\n\n\nEffortless Two-Finger Removal\nWe all have hundreds of things going on at once. Your dock shouldn't require two hands or some sort of finger yoga to remove your phone. You want simple and easy removal of your device no matter what's going on. With the EverDock Go, we call it two-finger removal. Just grab and go.\nEven Works With Auxiliary Audio Cables\nSeveral popular phones on the market include stereo line-in or \"aux cables\" allowing you to listen with headphones or to plug directly into your car stereo. We knew many of you would want to connect to your car stereo this way, so we are including an auxiliary plug allowing you to plug your current aux cable directly into the EverDock Go. Yes, we thought of everything.\n\"Aux Cable\" with Lightning connection for iPhone 5 and 5S\nUse Your Standard Apple Lightning and 30-pin cable. Micro-USB Cable Included.\nEach EverDock includes a customized micro-USB cable (1m/ 3ft long) designed specifically for your Android and other non-Apple devices. In order to avoid any unnecessary delays, and to ensure compatibility, Apple users can simply use their standard Apple lightning and 30-pin cables(Apple cables are not included).\nTech Specs\nEnjoy all the details of the EverDock Go and EverDock Dash. You may need to click on the \"Play\" button on the image below and you can drag and drop the image that appears so you can view the EverDock Go and EverDock Dash in 3D.\n\nAvailable in Silver or Black\nThe EverDock Go is available in Silver or Black creating a dramatic look that will complement your devices and your car.\nBuy the EverDock Go at fuzdesigns.com\nHow the Funds will be Used\nThe funds raised will go towards tooling, purchasing of raw materials, production, and shipping. We have finalized the design and qualified the manufacturer. We expect tooling to begin in May, production in June, and shipping from the factory in July.\n\nLink to Press Kit\nClick here to go to our press kit\nEverDock, Our First Kickstarter Project\nWhen we launched the EverDock on Kickstarter, we were absolutely blown away by the reception we received. We wanted to meet everyone\u2019s expectations and we think we did. In just two months, we shipped over 10,000 units to our backers. To learn more about the EverDock, please visit our EverDock Kickstarter project.\nFeel free to look through the comments section here to see what our previous backers thought about the original EverDock and the service they received from the F\u016aZ Designs team.\nAbout Us\n  F\u016aZ Designs was founded by David Gengler and Cameron Gibbs to create exceptional products for today's electronic devices.

In addition, we have already delivered on one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns of 2013, so we know how to navigate Kickstarter's unique challenges.\n\nWe have spent months designing, testing, and refining the design. We've already selected the manufacturer and started some basic tooling. The samples you see in the photos and videos work great and look fantastic, so we won't need to waste time tweaking the design. We have also adopted the BYOC (Bring Your Own Cable) approach to this project to avoid any unnecessary delays or compatibility problems associated with sourcing Apple's proprietary cables.\n\nHowever, every project caries with it certain risks. The most common risks are potential delays in tooling, obtaining raw materials, packaging, and shipping. While we feel like we have reduced these variables as much as possible, they can never be completely eliminated.\n\nWe feel our experience and familiarity with our manufacturer and the product development process gives us a unique skill set in handling unexpected problems. Most importantly, we will make sure to give frequent updates about progress so you'll always be informed about the status of the project.

EverDock Go includes an adapter with a spongy material that can expand to work with different thicknesses, but the production models weren't as adaptable as we required.\nWhen we realized this a couple weeks ago, we started a quick tooling change. We just needed to remove a little plastic from the adapter. We were hopeful this would be a very quick repair. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out this way. In fact, we were just informed yesterday that the entire tool would need to be discarded and we'd need to remake a new one. Needless to say, we were exceptionally frustrated.

We've done it. Thanks to your wonderful help Trigger Bell is going into full production and as well as your pledges, your feedback has also been incredibly encouraging. I'm absolutely delighted that Trigger Bell will now improve the safety of so many fellow cyclists.\nCan I pre-order a Trigger Bell?  Yes. Please visit www.triggerbell.com where you can pre-order.\nWhat is Trigger Bell?\nTrigger Bell is a bike bell which allows you to quickly warn other road users that you're approaching while you maintain complete control of your bike and keep your eyes on the road. You can ping your Trigger Bell whilst braking, turning and changing gear. You can now make yourself and other road users safer. Trigger Bell is patent pending.\nWhat are fellow riders saying?\n\"Stefan Buxton managed to make using the bell considerably safer and therefore more likely to be used... I think it's a great idea\", Bicycle World TV\n\"This looks the best idea yet for a bell on a road bike, i ordered one\", Headset Press\n\"It is as easy and safe to ping as it is to brake or change gear\", I Bike Daily\n\"The rider can keep their hand in the brake- and shifter-ready position, with just a flick of the thumb required to ring the bell.\", Gizmag\n\"Buxton's bell is an improvement on the New Departure bell [traditional bike bell]\", Bike Biz\n\"This project looks like one that could be a real hit with cyclists\", Singletrack\n\"Not only is it safer to use but it looks super clean too\", Swaggest\n\"Cool new safer bike bell\", Cyclr\n\"Re-inventing the bicycle bell\", London Cyclist\n\"Brilliant new bike bell design\", West Berks Spokes\nEXCEEDED \u00a310,000 stretch goal!\nThanks so much to all our Trigger Bell supporters for helping us to exceed the stretch funding goal! Trigger Bells will be in production and will be delivered per the schedule at the end of this text.\nExceeding the \u00a310,000 stretch goal means everyone who has pledged for any reward will also receive a set of \"T\" Trigger Bell reflective decals to be safer riding at night! So, for example, if you've pledged for a Jet Black Trigger Bell you'll now also receive the decals as an extra bonus thank you!\nHow is Trigger Bell different?\nThe difference stems from a very simple modification to traditional bike bells:\nTrigger Bell is secured under your handle bar.\nBrake, ping and control at the same time\n  With Trigger Bell you don't have to:\nLoosen your grip or stretch a finger or thumb to ping\nChoose between braking and pinging\nTake your eyes of the road\nA traditional bell may require you to stretch out a thumb which loosens your grip\nAlerting other road users is now as easy and safe as changing gears and braking.\nTrigger Bell sits discreetly beneath your brake out of the way of gears\nMaking cycling safer\nTrigger Bell came to life after I had an accident with a car when I had to swerve my bike to avoid a pedestrian who had stepped into the road without looking. This may have been prevented had I been able to ring my bike bell safely to alert the errant pedestrian. I strongly believe that with the right kind of warning system in place such accidents can be avoided. \nLoosening your grip for even a split second can dramatically reduce your ability to react, maneuver and brake safely. I designed Trigger Bell to solve this issue. The patent pending Trigger Bell is discretely secured under your handlebar. The ergonomic trigger sits near to your thumb while you\u2019re gripping your handlebars making it as easy and safe to use as it is to brake or change gear.  I hope you will join the mission to make cycling safer!\nAlways within easy reach and super quick to ping\nTrigger Bell is always within easy reach of your thumb, making it very quick to ping. Based on our road tests, a cyclist travelling at just 10mph will ping Trigger Bell between 8 and 20 feet sooner than a traditional bell. The ergonomic trigger also means your thumb moves in a more comfortable and natural direction than traditional bells.\n\u201cUsing Trigger Bell doesn't compromise braking or control... Every split second counts and can be the difference between avoiding an accident and being involved in accident\".\n- James Gilbert, Sales Assistant at a large London cycle store.\n\nTrigger Bell v2.0\nI've been working hard to improve the Trigger Bell design further and I'm delighted to announce Trigger Bell v2.0 which everyone who has pledged will be receiving. Below is a photo of the latest prototype of Trigger Bell and the key improvements. The prototype is made of white nylon and the production version will be made in super-tough black Acetal.\nTrigger Bell v2.0\n\nAlso, to demonstrate the strength of the spring, here's a photo of 2.5kg hanging from the hammer! Don't try this at home!\n\n\nRewards!\nIn return for your support of this campaign, you will be the first to receive your Trigger Bell in time for the Summer rides!

Check them out.\nJet black Trigger Bell\nMatch your Trigger Bell bell to your bike!\nTrigger Bell reflective decals\nHigh quality performance / technical Trigger Bell T-shirt\nRide this Penny Farthing while enjoying Victorian treats!\nHow to mount your Trigger Bell?\nTrigger Bell fits on the left hand side of most handlebars with diameters from 22mm to 36mm. This means that Trigger Bell can be secured to children's bikes right up to the widest racing bars using a single screw.\nTrigger Bell hidden on a fixie\nTrigger Bell on a standard handle bar\nTrigger Bell on standard drop handle bar. Trigger Bell can of course also fit on the cross bar. Here Trigger Bell is fixed offset to the brake so the brake lever moves freely\nTrigger Bell on standard drop handle bar with brake fully on\nTrigger Bell works perfectly with integrated rapid fire gear shifters and brakes\nNote:\nAlthough Trigger Bell is designed to work with the majority of handlebar types, Trigger Bell doesn't yet fit grip shift or twisty gears.\nTrigger Bell fits on the left hand handlebar.\nOn high-end bikes with separate rapid fire shifters and brakes (eg SRAM or Shimano Trigger Shifters), Trigger Bell sits on top of the right hand handlebar grip (see photo below).\nOn high-end drop handlebar racing bikes with gears integrated into the brakes (eg shift and brake lever sets), Trigger Bell fits on most brake / gear combinations but can sometimes get in the way whilst changing gear where the gear paddles are larger than normal.\nFor 80% of bikes it'll fit just perfectly!\nIf you've got any questions please drop me a mail (\"Contact me\" link at the top right of the page).\nTrigger Bell fitted on trigger shifter. Note it's above the handlebar on the right hand side and still more accessible than a traditional bell\nDesign process\nSince 2011 I've invested hundreds of hours testing, prototyping, demonstrating and improving Trigger Bell. Hand size statistics, bell physics and polymer properties have been used to refine and perfect the design, components and dimensions. The guys at Instrument Product Development have been involved in this project over the last year and helped finalise the design to bring it to this stage: ready for production.\nThe first prototype: Masking tape and gas canister\nExperimenting with bell shape\nFinalising the design\nOver 30 models have been made to test and retest Trigger Bell. In short, no stone has been left unturned and I can't thank the friends, family and fellow cyclists who have shared their feedback (and handlebars) enough!\nFinal production ready prototype\nThe bell is built in to a single sleek unit made out of Acetal (a super tough material used in mechanical gears and bearings) removing the need for a separate spring and hammer. The trigger has been tested to over 38,000 pings so you can be confident that it will last. I'm also running a longer test during March before the production tooling is made.\nTrigger Bell is a tiny 25mm in diameter and 48mm in length and a feather-light 25g in weight. Trigger Bell's size makes it incredibly discrete and it can comfortably be hidden beneath your brakes for a sleek, uncluttered look. Finally, the bell is made of high quality brass rather than standard aluminium. This makes every ping wonderfully loud, rich and clear.\nYour support\nEverything is ready to go for production and I need your support to fund the two moulds which are needed to manufacture Trigger Bell (one for the brass bell and one for the Acetal body). I have two overseas manufacturers ready and waiting to produce Trigger Bell. They have already stood out by making high quality and resilient parts for the prototypes you can see in the video. So, everything is in place and ready to go! Equally, I'll be working to get production back into the UK in the near future.\nMould for Trigger Bell prototypes\nIt's your support that will make production of Trigger Bell possible, so thank you for all your help.\nTimeline\nOver the last two years I\u2019ve worked with some great people and these are now the people who will produce Trigger Bell. That means that I can move from Kickstarter to production at a relatively low risk and in a short time period.\n\n    \u2022    MARCH - APRIL 2014: Kickstarter campaign.\n    \u2022    APRIL - MAY 2014: Production tooling made for Trigger Bell body and brass bell.\n    \u2022    JUNE 2014: Trigger Bell manufactured to the highest standard.\n    \u2022    JULY 2014: Custom bell colours applied to your Trigger Bell. Trigger Bells will be painted, assembled and packaged in the UK.\n    \u2022    JULY 2014: Dispatch Trigger Bells and all other rewards to their new homes worldwide in time for summer rides and races!\n\nThank you\nThank you so much for looking at my project and I hope it's something you can support. If you think Trigger Bell would benefit your friends and family, please do spread the word about this safer bike bell!\nImportant: No bike bell will make you invincible. Pinging a bike bell may not always get you heard above traffic or the ubiquitous iPod. Please continue to ride defensively and carefully. Trigger Bell allows you to control your bike while pinging so if you're not heard then you can brake to keep yourself and others safe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDesign Update: I'm working on making the Trigger Bell even tougher and easier to fit. This will improve the design of the spring and strap in the final Trigger Bell.\n\nManufacturing Update: I\u2019ve been working with both UK and overseas manufacturers of each component during prototyping. They have been enormously supportive throughout the process. Also, as so much of the functionality comes from the design and materials, this production model has helped improve both of these inputs dozens of times to get to the point Trigger Bell is at today.\n\nAlthough there are manufacturers lined up with the production mould and manufacturing runs already in their calendars there is always the risk of delay. Everything possible has been done to minimise these risks and I\u2019ll keep you posted if there\u2019s any chance we won\u2019t hit the timeline above.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 131, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1067040129/trigger-bell-a-safer-bike-bell", "project_name": "Trigger Bell - A Safer Bike Bell"}}, {"backer": "Alan Rickayzen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "There are two main deterrents to cycling: road safety and theft. \nSHYSPY GPS tracker not only enables cyclists to track their cycling activity but also to locate their stolen bikes in case of crime.\nSHYSPY GPS works in much the same way as other GPS tracking devices, the unit uses a combination of a mobile SIM card along with a GPS module to accurately track the location of your bike to and deliver this data to your desktop or mobile device via a data connection.\nThis version of our device offers the maximum accuracy and protection for your bike. Due to the location of the device we have incorporated both wireless and USB charging to alleviate the need to remove the device every few weeks just to top up the battery.\nSome of the hardware features:\nLong battery life. In passive mode (not tracking but connected to network) it can operate for 5 weeks continuously. It can also easily support a power down mode in which it will listen to external events (e.g., motion detection) and can run for months at a time (most likely even a year)\nQuad band GSM connectivity, meaning compatibility with all GSM networks.\nNow, there are plenty of other trackers out there, so what makes this one special? Besides the aforementioned simplicity of the hardware,  we see that most trackers today fall in two categories:\n\nThe first one uses hardware which is sold at a loss with a monthly contract to access the tracking data\nThe second one sends tracking information to a cell phone using SMS where the user can see the coordinates and open a link in Google Maps\nBoth have some serious disadvantages. The first one has a monthly cost attached even if you're not using the tracker. Furthermore, all the tracking data sits on a third party server. If there is a security breach or if the provider goes out of business your data could very well be compromised or lost.\nThe second one has a problem of usability. What if you want to track 3 or 4 or a lot more bikes? How do you efficiently manage this data? Sending text messages to the tracker is prone to errors and can be very tedious. Getting the data back and clicking on a link to get you to a Google map might work for one tracking point, but what if you are tracking a bike over time and need to see a history of your cycling activity?\nThe advantage of the second one however is that it uses SMS for the communication of tracking data from or commands to the tracker. Why SMS is a good idea over other technologies such as GPRS, EDGE or 3G/4G?\nCoverage: works even with connections that are not good enough for voice, and is available where other network services are not\nThe network itself acts as a buffer in case one of the communicating ends has no connection\nThe amount of power needed to send an SMS is much less than to e.g., set up a TCP connection over GPRS\nPoint to Point communication without the need for a server with static IP address\nThese, and other criteria make that SMS is a very good method specially for the cyclists who want to use the gps tracker as a security device, meaning that they may not need to track the bike for months and even years but they need to have the tracker ready at any moment if the bike crime happens.\n We just had to simplify the manual process of sending SMS with a software system: SHYSPY desktop and mobile app just do that for you. and gives you the choice to choose between either GPRS or SMS tracking methods and benefit from the one that suits you better.\nWhen it comes to keeping track of our cycling activity, there are a large variety of choices:\nInexpensive Cycle computers: to record the distance, speed, total travel time, but no geolocation data.\nGPS trackers: There are a lot of GPS trackers out there, in form of wearable watches, or mountable on your stem or handlebars. Professional models could have many additional functions such as power meter, heart rate and cadence sensors; And yeah... they cost a fortune. So you have to protect it as well; Mount it when you ride and take it away when you leave the bike unattended.\nSmartphones: Using our cellphone  along with popular sport tracking apps such as Endomondo, Strava and Sportstracker is another convenient choice; There is a compromise though and it's the risk of running out of battery on your mobile phone when you need it the most.\nWith SHYSPY however, you always have a tracker with your bike; The  long battery life of 30 hours, lets you track all the activities with no concern of any kind. Using the SHYSPY app you could monitor you activity and/or download it in GPX standard format to be later uploaded manually to major sport tracker platforms such as: Endomondo, Strava and Sportstracker, so you could compare your data with other members and socialize your cycling experience.\nSHY-SPY GSM is our low cost alternative to GPS tracking.\nThe device uses cell tower triangulation to calculate the location of your device based on signal strength. While this method is significantly less accurate than GPS tracking it does have the added benefit of being completely free of any ongoing data costs since it relies on a GSM signal rather than transmitting any data. If police track your bike, you don't even have to pay for SMS to locate the bike.\nin cities with larger number of cell towers GSM tracking should be accurate  to within 100 meters while in rural and remote locations this may rise to up to 10 km( It absolutely depends on the density and distance of cell towers) The idea of this product occurred to us while searching for a more economic alternative for gps trackers and we decided to develop SHYSPY GSM tracker. the concept of GSM trackers are not new, so we could design very easily on prior knowledge such as a great open-source project by open electronics.\nGSM tracker in practice:\nThe bigger the city, the more serious becomes the problem of bike theft.\nIn a small village one can not ride stolen properties without being noticed, in a metropolitan however with hundreds of thousands of cyclists and bikes, you would have a minimal chance to have your stolen bicycle once again.\nWhat if we knew whereabouts of our stolen bike? What if we knew in which neighborhood it is being ridden?\nSHY-SPY GSM-tracking does that for you. With accuracy from 100 to 200 meters in the cities to few thousands in remote areas, it allows you to know, in which neighborhood/ is your bike located.\nThis technology is fairly old and for years it has been deployed  by  emergency call centers to locate caller\u2019s position; it is based on measuring power levels  and antenna patterns and uses the concept that a powered mobile phone always communicates wirelessly with one of the closest base stations, Good thing about it is that in contrary to GPS technology it also works just fine at indoor spaces. In essence SHY SPY GSM tracker is a device similar to your old cell-phone, it doesn't have a screen and instead it has a motion sensor and a huge battery.\nBut How does a bike cellphone could help your bike to find her way back to you??\nThe first and best option is that you involve the police and ask them to track the bike cell number.. it was and still is a common practice for police to locate criminals by tracking their handsets and they want to do the same for your bike.\n But we don\u2019t live in a perfect world and It\u2019s possible that Police response is not as fast and as adequate as you expect\u2026 so you may consider tracking your bike and find it on your own.\n Primarily we wanted to design the simplest form of GSM unit and count on online mobile phone tracking systems such as followus.co.uk, world-tracker.com, mobilephonelocate.com , which with a small fee per track, one can locate his phone on their platform, but we noticed that they wouldn't work in all countries and all mobile service providers so we decided to develop our system with built-in tracking feature to make it even easier for our users to track their bikes and avoid those small fees as well. You would pay only for each SMS that you send and receive.\nEither via SMS or through SHYSPY app, you could locate your bike and once you have located your bike, based on your preference you can take several measures to find your bike and get it back.\nAs said before, the GSM tracking is not as precise as full GPS tracking but it is precise enough to locate the neighborhood. That gives you the possibility to simply go and visit that neighborhood personally, if you are lucky you may find your bicycle parked somewhere in vicinity.\n And If you don't find your bike on your own you can always ask for help.\nIf you know the neighborhood, putting some ads may be an option to get some help from the residents of that vicinity and this could increase the risk of riding stolen bikes\u2026\nIf you know whereabout of your bike, a printed Ad could return it to you even if you dont know where exactly is your bike.\nThe worst situation is when your bike in another city\u2026 Don\u2019t worry. There is still a solution for that\u2026 The thieves may try to sell the bike online, you could spend less time finding their Ad if you know where they are situated now.\nIn the mean time you can Write in local forums of that city and alert the cyclists of your loss. In cyclingboom.com/cyclists  we have also provided the possibility to search cyclists based on their location. hopefully this could turn to a great source of community help as the number of registered users increases.\nCharging and battery options\nBattery options\nSHYSPY trackers come with an ultra high capacity 18650 Li-ion battery (roughly 2500 mAh). This battery already enables you to track your cycling activity for at least 30 hours; if that is not enough, You may also pledge for an extra battery and increase the battery up to 5000 mAh. please note that this choice is 68mm longer than our basic trackers, (22 cm in total) and you may have to cut and shorten your seatpost to have space for this lengthy tracker. please read compatibility section before pledging for extra battery.\nCharging Options:\nDespite that our trackers are hidden inside the frames, one is not required to remove the SHYSPY unit in order to charge the battery:\nUSB charging.\n All the trackers come with an external antenna which in our case would not only be an antenna but also the USB charging point of the GPS unit itself. (this is not in our current prototype but will be integrated in all our GPS and GSM antennas in our production series).\nWireless Charging\nIf you have a non metallic frame, you may also pledge for a wireless charger and integrated receiver that could top up your battery level using wireless induction charging methods. Read more about wireless charging here.\nwireless charger is only compatible with some bamboo bikes and carbon seatposts\nCharging frequency:\nWe have tried to optimize our design in order to reduce the power consumption as much as possible: in general and depending on kind of deployment of the device and tracking intervals, the battery would have a battery life up to 30 hrs of constant tracking to a month of being in alert mode and up to a year in sleep mode ready to be activated by motion detection. \nProduct Compatibility\nIn order to have SHYSPY on your bike, you must have a bike with an internal seat tube with internal diameter of at least 26 mm and also a seatpost with a hole on top of it that allows wire routing from antenna to the GPS unit.\nIf you don't have such a seatpost, you may buy it online at \u00a39.99. We may also be able to include these seatposts in our reward package but it would be a better choice if you visit a local bikeshop or online stores and chose a seatpost of your exact size and also avoid double taxation and double shipments.\nHere are some products compatible with SHYSPY:\nB'TWIN 26mm\nB'TWIN ADJUSTABLE 27.2MM\nB'TWIN MTB 29.8MM\nEASTON EA50 OFFSET 27.2, 30.9, 31.6 sizes\nEASTON EA70 OFFSET 27.2, 30.9, 31.6 sizes\nEASTON EA70 ZERO 27.2, 30.9, 31.6 sizes\nAnother Important issue to consider is the length of the seat tube: If you have a bike with bottle-cage, chances are that those bosses and the screws would block the way of tracker toward the bottom bracket (this is more likely in case of 26 and 27 mm seat tubes), so make sure that you have enough space for both tracker and seatpost above the bottle cage. In some cases cutting and shortening the seatpost would resolve this problem, but not always specially in case of extra battery this problem could be more severe.\nIf you have a carbon saddle. this may also weaken or block the signal\nWireless Charging\nWireless charging is available for both GPS and GSM models but it compatible only with non metallic frames  Bamboo bikes and carbon. on the other hand the efficiency of the wireless charging is directly linked with the distance of receiver RX module from the transmitter. The charger would begin charging only when it senses a receiver module in a close distance (around 5mm or less) so if the cross section of your Bamboo frame/ carbon seatpost is not similar to the circular section of our charger (circle of 32mm radius), this feature may not work efficiently for you.\nDesktop and mobile app compatibility\nOur desktop app is compatible with Microsoft windows, Linux & Mac. \nWe have already developed the mobile app for android which is compatible with major android devices( back to android 2.3) and we will have it ready also for ios in case of successful fund.\nGSM compatibility\nWe use quadband GSM module which is compatible with all 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 MHz networks. It works in almost everywhere in the world except for japan and Corea. http://www.worldtimezone.com/gsm.html\nFuture development\nAudible alarm  \nAn audible loud alarm you can trigger from the app would be another option that we are considering to implement in both GPS and GSM devices. Using this feature however would be at your own discretion since it would give away the presence of SHYSPY on your bike and may have the thief to disarm and destroy the tracker, but on the other hand it may cause a panic for the thief and force him to leave the bicycle and escape. we would be able to implement this feature even in first production run providing that your feedback and comments proves us that its worth of it so let us know what you think.\nBluetooth Wireless pairing\nBluetooth pairing allows you to Transfer the tracking data directly from your GPS unit to your Cell via Bluetooth connection(no gprs data involved), This data could be saved in a standard .gpx file which could be manually entered to major sport tracking platforms such as Endomondo, Sports-tracker and Strava.\nFull Integration\nAll our trackers come with an external antenna that although is well hidden under the saddle, but still prone to be discovered by professional thieves as more people get to know about SHYSPY and more thieves get caught because of it. With enough investment we can however integrate and protect our device's antenna inside a seatpost that fully encloses the antenna but doesn't block the GPS signal. So the thief would have zero chance to discover and disarm the tracker.\nAnother area that we are keen to work on for the future are new ways to enable self-charging of the devices. We are currently looking into a number of methods such as Induction charging and piezoelectric generators to reclaim some of the energy created by the movement and vibration of bikes but unfortunately GPS units consume a lot of power and our primary experiments shows that at this stage we can not count on self charging method as the principal method of charging the device, yet we are planning to work in this domain and if we succeed we would offer an upgrade self-charger to be replaced with your extra battery and help topping up the battery level each time you go for a ride. That is not however a viable substitution for the current USB charging since we are aware it may take hours of movements just to generate enough power for GPS unit to just to get a lock on satellites.\nCall reception\nAnother option that we are considering to experiment with in future developments is that this tracker could be equipped with necessary means to automatically pickup the calls from authorized numbers\u2026  having this option means that you can listen to surrounding noises through integrated mic on the external antenna which may help you recognize the location or the thief himself\u2026 Technically there are some difficulties with this option since it would increase the cost of board and development and the Mic itself would not be able to receive a good quality of surrounding voices if the subject are far away. But that is not our sole concern since we also have privacy concerns that keeps this feature still in debate within our development team, so please don\u2019t spare your opinion in this regard in comment section. integration of such feature in future models, totally depends on your feedback to it in this kickstarter campaign and we look forward to hear from you.\nWhere your money will be spent? Why Kickstarter?\nSHYSPY has been in development for a little over 12 months and to date we have developed several working prototypes of the devices, design and development of our product has required us a lot of money and time as each prototyping phase may cost ten times more than a final product in the market.\nWe have already obtained CE and FCC certificate for our earlier GPS tracker but we need excessive tests to make sure our final design would also comply with CE and FCC regulations. This may add a lot to the cost of the test specially if we want to add Bluetooth pairing functionality. \nFurthermore, In order to offer an affordable device for all cyclists and not a luxury gadget just for elite, we need to have enough orders to proceed with the manufacturing of the PCB boards in a quantity that allows us in lowering overhead costs.\nWe need to buy the electronic pieces in bulk and we also have to pay a lot for the injection molding of plastic container. These are some of the costs that unfortunately we can not undergo anymore without your support and we hope with your help, our efforts would end up as a useful product in your hands that could deter bike thefts and help you in retrieval of your bike.\nWe already have developed Android and desktop applications. but we need to redesign the app for iPhone and consequently windows phone devices as well. \nYour opinions matter\nAnother reason why we started this campaign prior to production run is that we really love to hear your opinions and comments about different aspects of our design and we look forward to hearing from you.\nYour  rewards\nWe appreciate your support very much and try to reward you with something you would love to keep. Here are some of our rewards that we hope you would love them.\nAdornments\nCyclingboom Adornments (click for more pictures)\nClick for more photos\nSecurity kit (security screw and key for seatpost clamp)\nIn regard to bike crime, we face 2 problems. theft of bikes and theft from bikes. Theft of seatpost and saddles are common in many cities and this problem in particular could jeopardize  usability and security of our trackers, so every tracker comes complete with a security screw and its key to make sure you would not get your tracker stolen by a thief who intended to steal a saddle.\nGPS and GSM trackers.\nOur GPS and GSM trackers are pretty much the same in appearance, they come in the same container with optional wireless and extra batteries.\nHere is what you get:\nCurrent funding status\nClick for more up to date informaion\nOur team\nWRD systems & Cyclingboom gathered together in order to develop SHYSPY project and this versatile team has helped us significantly to take a look at different aspects of bike theft from different perspectives.\nCore Team:\nJohan Dams\nJohan is a published researcher and involved in many projects around the world in the fields of cryptography, robotics, embedded systems, software engineering and development, systems and security, machine vision and learning, software team management and many others.

Everyone on the team has a proven track record.\n\nNevertheless, some other potential problems can arise:\n\n-Component supply. If there are some components and modules with a larger than expected lead time, we might go over our estimated schedule. This is something we have experience with in the past, and we're trying to mitigate these situations to the best of our abilities, but it can be completely out of our hands.\n\n-Even though the PCB changes between the production version and prototype version are minimal, there can be problems with it. The way we will mitigate this risk is by getting a production version board build as soon as possible to verify the changes before producing larger quantity. Should there be unexpected issues, then this could lead to another round of testing and a secondary test version which could lead to unforeseen delays. We believe however that our review process mitigates this risk.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "WRD Systems\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nWRD Systems: Founded just five years ago on a tiny budget.

All of the footage in our video was made using our prototypes.\n How Heavy Is It?\n\nTotal weight with battery block is less than 100 grams (3.5 ounces). The tubes together weigh approximately 30 grams (one ounce). The weight of the tubes is distributed evenly around the wheel.\n How Long Does It Work?\n\nRadlicht works for more than 5 hours on a charge. The rechargeable battery block mounts on the wheel hub so it doesn't change the balance of the wheel. All parts are water and shock resistant. Radlicht has been tested over and over in rain and snow as well as in the city and forest to make certain that it survives any weather conditions.\nOn a picture light tube is working under the water:\n WHEEL FIT\n\nRadlicht fits 20\u201d and larger bike wheels with spokes. It is possible to install two Radlicht sets on one wheel in order to increase illumination or to mix two Radlicht of different colors on a single wheel. \n\nHubs: Maximum hub diameter is 60mm (2.5 inches).\n Spokes Fit:\n\n7 Tube Model - perfect for wheels with 14, 21, 28, and 35 spokes\n\n8 Tube Model - perfect for wheels with 16, 24, 32, and 40 spokes\n\n9 Tube Model - perfect for wheels with 18, 27, 36, and 45 spokes\nRadlicht does not fit wheels without spokes.\n INSTALLATION\n\nInstallation and setup take about 15 minutes and it is much easier if you remove the wheel from the bike. Simply connect the tubes to the spokes of your wheel and strap them together. Our Web site (http://radlicht.com/installation-manual) has step-by-step pictures to show you how to do it.\n What's the money for?\n\nThe current Radlicht is a prototype design. We need to incorporate further design elements to get Radlicht to a production ready status; i.e. to a place where it can be used by everyone. The battery holding device is an initial design. We have developed over 10 different colors and double color tube designs that we are making available as a \u201cThank You\u201d to our Kickstarter supporters. But we need your help to begin mass production and to make night time bike riding both fun and bright. \n\nIf funds remain, we will use them to build the working capital necessary for manufacturing the first production of Radlicht Bike Lighting Systems.\n  WHAT WE ARE OFFERING\nCustom build Radlicht. You can select by yourself the sequence of tubes' colors for your Radlicht-bike-light from our palette as well as the combination of any two colors at the same tube! Be unique!\n Where can we deliver Radlicht?\n\nFor this special pre-order, we can ship to the following countries only: USA, Canada, EU (all countries), Ukraine, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand. Orders outside USA and EU should include an extra shipping fee as noted in the pledge levels.\n\nHow Radlicht was born?\nOur first prototype was just wires with lamps connected to the wheel. In the video Invention of Radlicht we have showed the soldering process, connection, and our test samples of different colors which backers will be able to get as a reward.\n We had developed different prototype designs, and than chose the best one! \n\nOne of rim-based prototype (magnetic reed switcher technology): http://www.instructables.com/\nFrom the very beginning we have started with use of the battery block with 3 AAA rechargeable batteries. For our Kickstarter campaign we have changed it to the sealed USB rechargeable block that is much more practicable and convenient to use.\n At the moment we have made more than 100 samples. And have made more than 1000+ hours testing.\n Technical details of our latest prototype: \nTubes material: plastic; \nLED: green, red, orange, white, pink, blue colors, 3V, 3 mm diameter;\nbattery block on prototype: 3 AAA rechargeable battery 1.2V 1100 mAh\nFor our last prototype we use plastic *(Polypropylene) tubes. Polypropylene is tough and flexible, reasonably economical plastic. Polypropylene has good resistance to fatigue, and it has a melting point of 171 \u00b0C (340 \u00b0F).\nPolypropylene is recyclable!\nThe tube is filled with a purified gas mixture, and the gas ionized by lights between the ends of the sealed tube. Pure neon gas is used to produce only about a third of the colors. The greatest number of colors is produced by filling with another inert gases (for example, argon). \nOur production plan and schedule  \nDecember (3rd): Kickstarter Launch \nDecember: Agreements with manufacturing partners \"CAC Polywarm\" are finalized, all components will be assembled in Europe.\nDecember: Tools and components are ordered. T-Shirts printed. Postcards sending.\nJanuary: Manufacturing begins.\nFebruary/March: Testing and Shipping of first orders. T-Shirts delivery.\nApril: Main shipping.\nMay: All Kickstarter orders finalized. \nThanks!!!  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n*Supply chain delays. In production of Radliht many different parts are being used. Sometimes we are out of certain elements and have to wait for delivery, sometimes we need to redesign certain parts or create an alternative part.

Utilizing famous bits of equipment such as the Mu-Tron Bi-Phase, the Space echo, and various Fisher and Grampian reverbs, Lee has re-created his original signal chain and has been working in collaboration with Daniel to produce 15 tracks of original deep roots music, featuring a whole host of well known reggae players of instruments, and with Lee's vocals on top. These tracks have been produced as close to the original black ark style as possible, with vintage equipment, - Mics, compressors and effects; and raw recording techniques. A lot of tape saturation, live instruments, horns, guitar, bass, etc; all recorded live and blended together by Lee and I on a big analogue mixing desk...\nNow for the exciting bit!..... Lee, for the first time in many years, has been active on the mixing desk, and the effects units and has created his own Dub versions of each song; as well as being active at the mixing stage. For the fist time in many many years, the founder of Dub himself; has been actively involved in producing fresh, brand new Dubs of each song to be included on the album, poignantly titled - Lee 'Scratch' Perry - ''Back on the Controls''  Lee has been using the effects units, phasers, tape delays and reverbs, hitting the mixing desk doing the dubbing for the dub versions, and adding percussion and being heavily involved in the mixes giving direction on EQ, levels and the overall sound to make this as authentic as possible. We recorded all of Lees effects in real time into the mixes, and then let him loose on the faders and buttons on the desk for the final Dub versions. This process left us with a sublime dub version for each song, which Lee was personally responsible for dubbing and shaping the sound for!\nWith these recordings, Lee is keen to re-kindle his famous 'UPSETTER' Record Label and release these new recordings on this Label. This will truly be the first time in many years that Lee has released his own productions on his infamous Upsetter label!\nThe album brings back the true Upsetter style of Dubbing and Mixing, on heavy, hard hitting Deep roots rhythms backed by some stars of the reggae world, Hughie Izachaar, Hornsman Coyote, Christine Miller, Dennis Bovell and more, plus a couple of soon to be confirmed surprise legendary artists!\nWhy do we need your help?\nThe Album is all but complete, 15 tracks and Dub versions have been produced and mixed, with a number of nearly finished tracks. We have a good selection of tracks now, consisting of a song, horns cut, and Dub versions for each one. So, the idea is; we are going to do a part 1 and part 2 vinyl and CD release globally to ensure we can get all of this music out to the masses!\nThe Kickstarter project has been set up to see if we can locate some Lee Perry fans within the Kickstarter community to help with the final stages, the mastering and physical production costs. We have finalized a distribution agreement with 'Virtual Label' in Brooklyn USA,  http://virtuallabel.biz/ so it is all ready to go, On top of this we have been working with renowned Reggae Photographer Nick Caro http://www.nickcarophotography.co.uk/  on producing some stunning artwork for the album, alongside extras such as studio time with Lee, a series of limited edition studio session photos signed and framed, available as rewards.\nThe final hurdle is why we have reached out to the Kickstarter community, to enable us to complete the artwork, the mastering and manufacture; and the re-kindeling of the Upsetter Label! Resulting in us being able to bring this album to the world!\nWhy should you help us to release this Album?\nWe truly feel that this album will be a seminal release in the Lee Perry catalog, not only a chance to bring his new and personal works to the world, but a chance to hear the master and founder of Dub music back on the controls, and doing what he does best, adding his touch to create some sublime dub soundscapes, through the very same vintage equipment he used all those years ago in the Black Ark studio; Jamaica. Releasing this in a home grown fashion, on Lee Perry's inimitable Upsetter Record label.\nHow can I donate and be part of this album? \nJust click on the green \u201cBack this Project\u201d button in the upper-right-hand corner. Email us if you have any problems or questions. The rewards will be shipped to wherever you live.\nWhat is our Kickstarter Goal?\nWe have calculated that the minimum we need is \u00a36000 to finish the project and release it globally. This goal is to Master the Album with the famous ''Kevin Metcalef' in London, then manufacture the record as a single Vinyl and CD album release globally! Of course, we have a ''Stretch Goal''  If we can raise \u00a38,000 or above, we will do a double vinyl release rather than a part 1 and part 2. If we can get all of this music out to the world in one go, then that is better for us! Then we will release some special versions on 10\" & 7\" Vinyl; again on the Upsetter Label! (This follows onto our next project, voicing  a number of old Black Ark singers onto these Rhythms...more on that to come......)\nThe trick is, including the Songs and Dub versions on each record, so this pretty much doubles our track count. The Horns cuts will be available as extras on the digital download release. We are set up and ready to manufacture the album, as soon as we hit our kickstarter goal, we will press the records enabling us to ship them globally the following month! \nSo, I hope you have enjoyed our video, put together by Nick Caro, and I hope you can share in our vision to bring this album to the world in 2014, Lee 'Scratch' Perry's re-birth of the Upsetter label and brand new song and dub album produced by Lee 'Scratch' Perry himself!\nThank you for your time!\nLee 'Scratch' Perry and Daniel Boyle.\nScratch on the percussion!\nLee 'scratch' Perry - Back on the Controls.\nPlease listen to some 'ROUGH MIXES' leaked on Soundcloud from the album, and other Rolling Lion Studio works..

If you are sharing bikes with others, the frame pad will make your bike stand out in the crowd and will give it a more distinctive and identifiable look. So this way you can easily eyeball the shared bikes that use BitLock from a distance. \n How BitLock works:\nVideo Demo 1:\n BitLock Demo 2:\n Lock exploded view 2:\n components:\nSpecifications:\nBattery: Lithium-thionyl chloride 2.4Ah non-rechargeable\nBattery life: 10,000 lock/unlocks (5 years with average usage)\nBattery shelf life: 20 years\nProduct dimensions: 4\u201d x 8\u201d (10.2cm x 20.3cm) \nProduct weight: 2.40 lbs (1.09 kgs)\nShackle thickness: 12mm (0.47 Inch)\nMaterial: Heat-treated and cut-resistant steel\nHigh security disc-style cylinder \nProtective vinyl covering\nLithium thionyl chloride (Li-SOCl 2) battery is the best candidate for low power remote monitoring and sensing applications, such as environmental and oceanographic measurement, animal tracking, emergency locators, RFID devices, etc where the cost of battery replacement becomes prohibitive and a self-contained power supply is required. Lithium thionyl chloride batteries feature the highest energy density of all lithium chemistries (1,420 Wh/l compared to ~500Wh/L for the rechargeable lithium battery in your smartphone), high capacity, and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures (-55\u00b0C to +125\u00b0C). The battery used in BitLock holds 2.4Ah of energy in a standard AA form factor. It also offer 20+ year service life due to extremely low self-discharge (less than 1% per year compared to 3% per month for rechargeable lithium batteries) and are designed with a unique safety feature that protects the cell against extreme temperature, pressure, puncture, shock and vibration. With the current design, BitLock can perform more than 10,000 lock/unlock operations on a single battery. This is enough to provide a 5-year battery life under average usage. No charging is needed. Once the battery level is low, the user gets a notification on their smart phone to replace the battery.\nBitLock Evolution: from idea to reality\nMost of the hardware design process was centered around finding an efficient, compact, and secure locking mechanism. Using a solenoid was out of question. Solenoids are very power hungry and inefficient. The actuation system had be driven by a low power DC motor. \nLinear actuation is messy. Worm gears (in fact all gears) must be enclosed inside a dust proof box enclosure to ensure reliability. Making custom gearing system would increase the cost and complicate the project. \nOne of the first prototypes\nThis was a starting point. The design had a lot of flaws. The load on the motor had to be minimal to save power. In this design the motor was doing a lot of unnecessary work (rotating the batteries too!).Also, the locking mechanism was not secure enough. More research and rigorous prototyping had to be done to get to the perfect lock.\nBrainstorming and research\nAfter doing a lot of research, I eventual found it! Disc locking was the best choice. It was simple and it provided high level of security. Putting the ideas together...\nThings beginning to shape up\n Now it was time to find the best DC motor. To find the perfect candidate, I had to search for a motor that yields the best performance, cost, and power characteristics.\nWhen I started this project, bluetooth low energy (BLE) was only in iPhone 4S. So I was looking all around to find a Bluetooth module that would support all smartphones. Soon I realized that the change is happening faster than I thought and switched to back BLE. BLE was the best option. It was cheaper, connectivity was fluid and easy, and most importantly it consumed very little power.\nThen, it was time to get more detailed sketches inside a CAD software.\nPCB design began. I got the PCB from OSHPARK. Awesome service, highly recommended! (no I am not affiliated with OSHPARK)\nSoldering SMD devices specially the micocontroller with QFP packaging was a nightmare. Fortunately, there was a reflow oven in TechShop of Menlo park (well it is technically a toaster oven attached to a temperature controller!!!). It made soldering a lot easier. \nThe soldering paste however was not properly stored in cold temperature and it was too thin. As you can see the paste under microscope is not properly laid out on the PCB. I had to buy new paste. Eventually it worked out! It was time to program the microcontroller\nLet's load the firmware\nThe PCB was designed to eliminate the need for an extra connector on board. It saved space and dough.\nI was playing around with a rectangular design. I ran into a bunch design problems and decided to switch to tubular design.\n 3D printing the compartments and iterating on the prototype:\n Getting crafty on the manual mill! \n  I was contemplating about making a few limited edition BitLocks with the logo CNC'ed on the plugs and filled with blue and green epoxy. Then, I realized it was too much overhead. But if you are interested let me know;) I can make it for you.\nThe tube had to be painted. I fell in love with this blue color at first sight. So I decided to powder coat the tube with Azure Blue.\nProduction Plan:\nWe have been working with our sourcing partner, Berkeley Sourcing Group, to identify factories in Shenzhen China that are well equipped to manufacture BitLock. As soon as the project is successfully ended, I will be heading to Shenzhen China to inspect the identified factories in person and begin manufacturing the factory prototypes for quality control. We have also contacted our part suppliers to make sure they all have multiples of the necessary quantities in stock and will place the orders as soon as the funding goal is reached. We are also expanding our team of engineers to move faster on the software side and to make sure the software development process is fully pipelined with the manufacturing process. \nWho am I?\nMy name is Mehrdad and I am the founder of Mesh Motion Inc.\nFacebook - LinkedIn - Twitter\nI have been writing code and making electronics as long as I remember. Around 15 years ago, when I was in high school I made a home security device that was attached to landline and called an emergency number in case of home intrusion. At the time, I didn't know anything about microcontrollers - In fact micro-controllers were not as ubiquitous as today. So I used basic glue logic in an attempt to implement a state machine to make it!! And soon realized that there must be better a way to do it. I needed to learn more.\nTo find answers to all of these questions in my head, I set out to go to college to study electrical engineering. Well I may have done too much of that. I continued my education and eventually got my PhD from Rice University. I\u2019ll tell you about my research thesis later.\nAs I was nearing graduation, there was something missing inside me. I didn\u2019t know what it was at first. I had deep technical knowledge across many different fields and topics but I didn\u2019t feel fulfilled. I soon realized that I had a huge urge to make and create which was suppressed for many years. Making things just for the sake of making. I needed to go back to making. Making something from scratch and breathing life into it. It could be anything, even a sculpture.\nIt was around the same time when I got obsessed with the idea of smart phones replacing keys. What made me interested was not merely replacing physical keys with another physical object. I was more fascinated about the potential of being able to share access remotely in a flexible and frictionless way. Sharing access to stuff. Objects. Anything. Being able to lend and borrow stuff anytime and anywhere in the world.\nI asked myself: What are the objects we can share? There were so many of them. So I decided to make \u201cA\u201d lock and let people decide what to share and with whom to share. But I needed a starting point. So I decided to start out with bike sharing.\nThen technical questions arose. What about reliability issues? What about the battery? When Bluetooth low power came out, I knew it was a game changer. It solved the radio power consumption and connectivity issues. But still I had to figure out an efficient way to perform mechanical actuation. I also began researching about battery technologies to find the best candidates.\nWhen I started out, I had almost no knowledge of manufacturing. I came to this from an electrical and computer engineering background. I had been mostly writing code and make electronics and was less familiar with mechanical engineering, design and manufacturing. So I took more than 15 fabrication classes in Tech Shop of San Francisco (Autodesk Inventor and AutoCAD, CAD2CAM, mold design, CNC, basic metal shop, manual metal lathe and milling machines, mold making, Injection molding, sand blasting, powder coating, etc.) to fill this knowledge gap.\nI felt like being in heaven working in Techshop. I felt like being a child who was given all the toys he asked for. I could play all day. I had to be reminded to eat. I worked day and night without feeling tired. I did that for more than 10 months. Throughout this project, I got a chance to work with the brightest engineers and designers and learn from them. It has been an intense crash course on everything, and a wonderful journey. I really hope I can continue this with your support and deliver an exceptional product to you.\nAcknowledgements:\nI'd like to thank Stephen Jean-pierre from VizualJockey and Sam Leabo from 5AM Films for doing such a fantastic job on the video.

We don't want to be one of them. We strongly believe in \"under-promising and over-deliving\". Because of that we decided to add enough time margin to our estimated delivery date to make sure BitLock is shipped on schedule. We understand that we may lose some backers because of the mid-summer ship date but we believe we can later bring them onboard to join the BitLock family once we are in full production.\n\nManufacturing:\n\nFrom the beginning of this project we followed a 3-word mantra: \"Make it simple\" Every step of the way, we made sure all of BitLock components are designed for manufacturability. This mindset has helped us a lot. \n\nWe have been working with our sourcing partner (Berkeley Sourcing Group) to identify the qualified factories in Shenzhen China to manufacture BitLock. Our sourcing partner has taken more than 400 products from inventor's hands out to market over the past eight years.\n \nAs soon as the project reaches the funding goal, we will begin manufacturing factory prototypes from the identified factories for quality check and start manufacturing the first batch of BitLocks for beta testing afterwards. \n\nDesign Changes:\n\nThe design of some of the internal components of BitLock are still being finalized before the making final mold, and are subject to slight changes. Although minor changes has to do with internal components and design for manufacturability, there is always the chance that this can slightly change the look of the product.\n\nFCC certification: \n\nWe are using a Bluetooth Module that FCC, IC, ETSI, CE, RoHS certified. Because of that we do not have to deal with the gruesome FCC certification process. End product listing is free and easy to do. This will save us 3-6 months of work and hundred of thousands of dollars of certification fees.\n\nHowever we still may have do some EMC testing on the final product which is going to be much easier.\n\nPart Suppliers:\n\nDuring the design, we tried to use off-the-shelf components as much as possible and avoid using specialty parts or parts available only through a single supplier. We have contacted all of our suppliers to make sure they have all of the necessary components in stock for immediate shipping. \n\n\nSoftware:\n\nWe have finished the development of iPhone application, however it is not fully tested and ready for deployment. The work on the Android application is still under development. We are sizing up our engineering team to make the development of the applications as well as the backend service for key management in parallel with manufacturing of the hardware.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Where is your BitLock??", "update_content": "Dear backers,\nIt has been a while since we posted the last update.
