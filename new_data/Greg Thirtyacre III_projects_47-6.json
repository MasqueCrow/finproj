The patented feeler easily docks on your interdental space, press the Wingbrush and you are done. Stop searching and start finding the interdental spaces!\nYou do not longer have to bend or injure yourself in front of the bathroom mirror while using floss. Use the Wingbrush while watching TV, checking your smartphone or quickly after every meal. Interdental cleaning made simple!\nThe use of interdental brushes is associated with lower risk for periodontitis, tooth loss, heart attacks and diabetes. \nWe did a scientific study on 1000 interdental spaces. The results were clear. With the Wingbrush test persons could reach significantly more interdental spaces than with a conventional interdental brush. On top, the test persons preferred the Wingbrush. It's so easy, that you start cleaning your interdental spaces regularly.   \n  Where can I use the Wingbrush?\nWhy is the Wingbrush better than floss, sticks and oral irrigators?\nAbove, we explained the importance of interdental cleaning. But do you clean them every day? You probably don't. All available devices have weaknesses: \n  Change the size, not the system:\nWe are starting with 3 replaceable brush sizes. It is necessary to offer more than one size, because every mouth is unique and needs individual prophylaxis. \nISO 0 (small): Fits in every gap, especially for small interdental spaces, patients with brackets or retainers.\nISO 2 (medium): For wider gaps or teeth with crowns, bridges or implants.\nISO 3 (large): Conically shaped bristles, serves a wide range with a small wire. Perfect size for patients with periodontitis or wide gaps. \n   As seen on:\n  We need wings to make our campaign fly. Hit one of the buttons below and show the Wingbrush to your friends.\n Our Story: \nDuring Louis' study of dental medicine, he recognized dentists usually act when it is too late. Dentists repair teeth or extract them because of caries or periodontitis.\n \nNobody is born with bad teeth. Daily oral care routine is the key for healthy teeth and healthy gum. Interdental cleaning is a important part of this. So, the main question we tried to solve was: How is it possible that everyone is aware of the importance of interdental cleaning, but nobody is doing it? We found the reason in the devices available for interdental cleaning. They either have a bad handling or a bad cleaning power. \nIn 2012, our dentist Louis quickly got the idea to combine the feeler, known of his oral irrigator, with his interdental brush. After first tests with lots of superglue all over our teeth, we knew that it could work. Market research of Burak and Marc showed, that nothing similar is available in the market. \nAfter convincing M+C Schiffer GmbH, the biggest manufacturer of oral care devices in Europe, of our patented idea, we started making the Wingbrush reality. With each prototype, interdental cleaning became more simple and pleasant. A scientific study of the University of Bonn with almost 1000 interdental spaces showed a great advantage in handling and reachability of interdental spaces. \nThe results motivated us to found our company called LUORO. The vision is to simplify oral care with innovative products. The Wingbrush is our first product.\nWe are ready to start, please support us to establish the Wingbrush in every bathroom. \nBelow you find just some sources highlighting the problem with flossing and the importance of interdental cleaning:\nMedical benefits of dental floss unproven\nThe effectiveness of interdental brushes\nWhy should I use interdental brushes?\nIs flossing your teeth a waste of time?\nA little bit more scientific evidence for all dental nerds out there:\nEvidence suggests that interdental cleaning with interdental brush is the most effective method for interdental plaque removal.\nNo studies reported the effectiveness of flossing plus toothbrushing for preventing dental caries.\nUse of floss/interdental brushes is associated with lower risk for new cardiovascular events.\n   Rewards:\nStretch Goals:\nPostcards:\n      Travel Case:\nOur timeline:\n      This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.

Simply put, HICKIES\u00ae is a smart and easy to use lacing system that connects each pair of eyelets independently and makes your shoes look fit and perform better. With the HICKIES\u00ae lacing system you can turn your shoe into a slip-on that securely adapts to your foot\u2019s movements, and renders knots and bows to be a sloppy look of the past.\nSneakers have evolved in every way except for shoelaces \u2013 they've been around since 3500 BC. Today shoes are made using the most advanced materials and latest innovations: we walk on chambers of air, wear custom memory foam insoles, and have threaded adaptative uppers. SO WHY DO WE KEEP LACING UP OUR SHOES WITH STRINGS?\n  The HICKIES\u00ae lacing system connects each pair of eyelets separately. This allows you to customize the fit with different tension in different parts of the shoe. Instead of a single lace running through the length of your shoe, each HICKIES\u00ae strap expands and contracts independently responding to each movement of your foot.\n    Your sneakers will feel more comfortable and perform better than ever before.\n   Here is our Press Kit.\n    HICKIES\u00ae is the only lacing system that allows you to adjust your fit and have different levels of tension along your entire foot. This is because the HICKIES\u00ae Lacing System is modular, meaning instead of one lace running through the length of each shoe, you have one strap per pair of eyelets. This gives you maximum control when it comes to customizing tightness, comfort, and style. The HICKIES\u00ae lacing system fits any sneaker. Experiment to find your perfect fit.\nWould you like to watch a real demo? Join us on our livestream sessions. Please leave a comment with your questions here or email us directly at social@HICKIES.com and we\u2019ll answer them in the next live stream.\n  Evolution never stops, neither do we.

You can use our different lacing techniques to tighten or loosen your shoes to make your shoes more comfortable.\n     Whether you're rocking shoes from New Balance or Vans, HICKIES\u00ae lacing system works with many types of shoes as long as they have eyelets. HICKIES 2.0 give you two size options: one slightly longer for adults (12 years and up) and HICKIES Kids for children (between 4-11 years old).\n    HICKIES\u00ae 2.0 comes with 14 units per pack, and HICKIES\u00ae Kids with 10 \u2013 both enough for 1 pair of shoes!

Our happy backers can attest that we deliver on our promises of quality and timeliness.\nWe've built mechanisms into our timeline to ensure we can deliver rewards on time even in the case of a massive campaign. That\u2019s why we set some rewards to be sent before the holiday season and others after. Our several prototypes have been tested over and over again and we are 100% committed to following through on our word.\nIn preparation for this new Kickstarter campaign, we made arrangements for production and delivery. The factory is lined up and we\u2019ve gone with Backerkit for the survey and fulfillment to ensure that everything runs smoothly and that our backers get their HICKIES laces in time for the holiday season. Now, we just need to know how many sets to produce and we can get started.\nIf despite our meticulous planning, under rare circumstances out of our control, our delivery deadline cannot be met, we promise to be transparent with our backers and keep you informed every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1x KICKSTARTER PRICE", "descp": "Get a package with 14 Hickies 2.0 for your favorite sneakers!

One of the few women recognized as central to the New York art scene, she had over 20 group shows scheduled for 1970 in addition to being chosen for a cover article in ArtForum Magazine. When she died in May, 1970 the life of one of that decades\u2019 most passionate and brilliant artists was tragically cut short. And although she had only a single one-person show of her sculpture during her short life, the subsequent years have seen multiple retrospectives and purchases for the permanent collections at major museums from the Guggenheim to the Tate, from MoMA to the Pompidou.\nPhoto of Hesse by Barbara Brown circa 1963, from a newly uncovered cache of photos by this photographer. Quote from Hesse's journals.\n An Extraordinary Woman \n\"Eva Hesse\" is a feature-length documentary exploring the journey of this extraordinary woman; an artist whose life was in dynamic interplay with the development of her ground-breaking work. The story takes place in the excitement of 1960\u2019s NY; the downtown art scene with the creative community, in their studios and on the streets plays a major role as does the burgeoning feminist movement. The film also explores Hesse\u2019s youth as a Jew in 1930\u2019s Germany, a country she would return to in 1964 to face her past and forge her future. \nHesse in front of \"Metronomic Irregularity\" 1966. Photo by Norman Goldman.\nHesse Unpublished Journals, Newly Uncovered Photos & Rare Footage\nInterviews with major art world figures including artists Dan Graham, Richard Serra, Carl Andre, Robert and Sylvia Plimack Mangold and Nancy Holt (in her final filmed interview before she passed) expand the focus of the film beyond Hesse's own experience into the community of artists that populated downtown Manhattan in the sixties.\nPhoto by Gretchen Lambert, 1966\nNicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Museums, Whitney Curator Elisabeth Sussman and writer Lucy Lippard, all of whom curated important Hesse exhibitions, add another perspective. The interviews are mixed with archival footage from the period, newly uncovered still imagery and rare home footage as well as beautifully lit shots of Hesse\u2019s art which capture not only the story of this artist but also sketches a vibrant landscape of the time. \nDetail \"Vinculum\", 1968\nThe narration, primarily Hesse\u2019s words spoken with wonderful sensitivity by Selma Blair (Hellboy, The Fog) is excerpted from her voluminous and passionately written journals and gives an understanding of what she was thinking and feeling, adding a deeply personal and emotional element to the film.\nSelma Blair voicing Hesse's journals\nEva wasn't the only writer in the family and Bob Balaban (Girls, Moonrise Kingdom\" voices Hesse's father reading from William Hesse's wartime journal and from deeply moving letters to his daughter. Eva also corresponded often with her close friend and colleague, Sol Lewitt who is voiced by Patrick Kennedy (Boardwalk Empire).\nHelen, William and Eva Hesse circa 1942\nHow We Got Here\nFour years ago, we embarked on a journey that has taken us thousands of miles, engaged us for thousands of hours and called upon hundreds of crew members, interviewees, researchers and supporters to band together so that we could tell this story before it slipped away. Eva was born in 1936, and many of the folks who knew her are in their 70's, 80's and beyond. We knew that this was a now or never opportunity. Happily, many individuals and organizations both in the US and Europe agreed. \nLetter to Rosie Goldman, written during Hesse's artist residency in Kettwig, Germany 1965\nThere is now a finished film which will debut in April of 2016 at Film Forum in NY and then play around the country and throughout the world. So here we are on Kickstarter, looking to expand the project's community of support which will carry the film through this next exciting stage. Read on for more about Eva, her creative community and the work for which she is justly celebrated.\nInstallation View of \"Chain Polymers\", Hesse solo show at Fischbach Gallery 1968\nCreativity and the Engaged Life\nEva Hesse explores the universal challenge of living an engaged life; a life of courage, discipline and joy even when the world is telling you that you have little chance of success. It is a story about art and about life; and how the two combine to create one of the most universal of life\u2019s experiences.\nPhoto by Hermann Landshoff, 1968\nMore pics and words on...\nfacebook Eva Hesse Documentary pinterest Eva Hesse Documentary\ntwitter @evahessedoc / instagram @evahessedoc / tumblr @evahessedoc\nEva and Tom Doyle on roof of 5th Ave. loft.

Time to Move Ahead\n\nNow that we have a finished the film it's time to get it out there. That's where you come in! There's a lot of interest from theatrical venues and museums but in order for us to move forward we need funds to market and distribute the film. We need to deliver a great trailer, build a dynamic website, hire someone to get the word out and create a high quality package of deliverables for our distributor. \n\nThe challenge for us right now is to be able to move forward while all the energy is buzzing about the film. It's time to share it and we are looking to build a community to help us carry the project into this next stage. We got this far with the support of foundations, a grant from the German government, European pre-sales and close friends and family.

This will fund color correction and sound mix on the almost-completed film. This is essential to portraying the sights and sounds of Afghanistan, Texas, and Micronesia as vibrantly as the real thing.\nA huge, overwhelming, heartfelt THANK YOU to our early supporters who helped us reach our initial funding goal.\nThank you, Kulo, Kinisou, Kalahngan, Kamagar & Sa Hachigchig! \nLove, Nathan, Bryan and Fivel\nISLAND SOLDIER is a feature-length documentary that tells the personal stories of young Micronesian soldiers serving in the U.S. military. The film follows them from a remote island in the Pacific to boot camp in the U.S., an outpost in Afghanistan and back. \nArthur Nena, boot camp and Kosrae\nBy sharing intimate stories of these soldiers and their families we can: humanize the impacts of U.S.-led foreign wars, show how a small island nation is caught up in a global power struggle, and let people know about Micronesia's uncertain future as it faces frightening economic and environmental changes.\nWe think it is important to ask, \"Why are so many young Micronesians leaving 'island paradise' to fight another nation's wars?\" Thousands of Micronesians - from a small population - leave family and deep community ties, and put their lives at risk. At times, there are multiple generations of Micronesian families serving in the US military together. And because it is a small nation, the repercussions of war are visible and deep. \nThe film is already supported by many amazing cultural and media organizations, and we were recently recommended for production funds from Pacific Islanders in Communications for $50,000!\nBut, there\u2019s a catch.\nThey\u2019re requiring us to produce matching funds for that $50k before being awarded the money. To that end, we\u2019ve been able to raise $15,000 from other sources, which means we now need just $35,000 more to unlock the original funds. That\u2019s why we\u2019re launching this Kickstarter -- to get us over that finish line.\nNow is the time to tell this story because Micronesia and its citizens at home and abroad are at a critical crossroads. Micronesian soldiers, once they return home after duty, have no access to veterans medical benefits (there is no VA in the FSM). \nWe are uniting friends, family and soon-to-be friends in a supportive community around ISLAND SOLDIER. We're taking our cue from Micronesia, where \u201cwealth\u201d is valued by how much you share resources and support friends, family and even strangers. By contributing to this campaign, you are becoming part of the ISLAND SOLDIER community.\nNathan Fitch - Director, Island Soldier\nI joined the Peace Corps in 2004, and was assigned to the island of Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, a former U.S. territory and independent nation since the 1980\u2019s. I fell in love with this tiny volcanic island in the South Pacific, with its lush jungles, white sands beaches, and close-knit society. But I also discovered that since 9/11, Micronesia had become a \u201crecruiter\u2019s paradise\u201d for the U.S. military, and that a disproportionate number of young Micronesian men were now fighting on the front lines in Iraq, on the other side of the globe.\nI had so many questions for them: Why are you fighting for the U.S. in Iraq, when I, a U.S. citizen, am not? What is it like to leave such a peaceful place for the turmoil of war? What is it like to return? It was these questions, and the somewhat guilty understanding that they were serving in my place, that is the impetus behind the documentary ISLAND SOLDIER.\nOver the past 3 years, we\u2019ve been filming with the film\u2019s main subjects all over the world -- in Micronesia, Hawai\u2019i, Texas, Georgia, and Afghanistan. To date, we\u2019ve captured roughly 80% of the footage necessary to tell the personal stories contained within the film. A rough cut of ISLAND SOLDIER has already been assembled, and is simply awaiting the final footage to be shot.

He puts his life on the line every day, driving an armored vehicle for the explosives ordinance disposal unit in a remote province of Kandahar.\nMaryann Nena\nSapuro Nena\nMaryann Nena is the mother of Sapuro Nena, a Kosraen soldier killed in action in Afghanistan.  \nMadison Nena\nArthur\u2019s father, Madison, advocates for a more traditional Micronesian life, even as he watches all his children depart Kosrae for oppertunities abroad.  An important community leader, Madison is part of a task force that is attempting to plot a sustainable course for the islands after US funding is slated to end in 2023.\nMaking a movie on opposite ends of the world is very expensive. The money will mostly go directly towards funding final shoots in Micronesia and Hawai\u2019i, post-production (editing, sound mix, graphics), and to your donation rewards.\nAnd there are rewards for your contributions at every level.

With that in mind, we all work as professional filmmakers, yet this is a \u201cpassion project.\u201d We have dedicated hundreds of unpaid hours to getting it to this point. Fundraising, editing and outreach are enormously time consuming. Yet, foundations want to know that people are getting paid to steer projects like this. Paying our team members means the project is far more likely to be completed and encourages accountability. That is why this Kickstarter campaign is so critical. It will demonstrate our professionalism to major foundations, and therefore we\u2019ll far better odds at receiving future funding. \n\nOne of the greatest hurdles to a fantastic documentary is \u201caccess.\u201d Documentary filmmakers need the subjects, and often their friends and families, to be on board. Nathan has already spent many years of his life dedicated to being involved with Micronesian communities in the U.S. and abroad - from his Peace Corps service in 2004, developing Micronesia\u2019s first skateboard team and learning a local language, Kosraen, spoken only by about 8,000 people.

But even \u00a310 donation will help us get there! \nBackground: Since our launch at Sundance in January, How To Change The World has had a fantastic press and audience response at festivals and in cinemas. But now we want to take this story to the widest possible international audience with an US Oscar qualification campaign and \nGreenpeace founders embarking on the first campaign against Alaskan nuclear testing\nFROM DIRECTOR JERRY ROTHWELL\nIt's taken 7 years to bring the story of the founders of Greenpeace to the screen, since first discovering over a thousand cans of 16mm film in the vaults of the Greenpeace archives.\nWhat drew me to the material is that shows a unique attempt to effect global change by a small group of committed, idealistic pioneers. At the same time it is the story of all nascent groups. The men and women who came together in those early years were an eclectic gang whose different skills contributed to a group that combined scientific rigour and engineering savvy with beliefs in the I-Ching and First Nations mythology...\nDirector Jerry Rothwell (right) filming behind-the-scenes of \"How to Change the World\"\nCONTINUED...\nSome were in it for the politics, some for the science, some just for the adventure. But like a band with an unexpected hit song that catapults them to global fame, the media success of their first anti-whaling campaign forced them into a maelstrom, which at times threatened to destroy everything they had accomplished.\nThe Greenpeace founders\u2019 reflections on this period speak not only of environmentalism, but of all movements for change, and also of the dilemmas of growing up and growing older: the tension between youthful idealism, ego and courage on the one hand, and maturity, pragmatism and political manoeuvring on the other.\nI think their experience has a lot to teach us, at a time when action for the environment is more urgent than ever. \nHelp us reach our goal and bring the film to cinemas worldwide.\nGet a Community Screening in your City or Town with our rewards, exclusive to Kickstarter\nTHE FILM\nIn 1971 an eclectic group of pioneers \u2013 hippies, journalists, musicians and scientists \u2013 set sail from Vancouver in an old fishing boat. Their mission was to stop Nixon's atomic bomb tests on a tiny island off Alaska. Amongst them was Bob Hunter, a charismatic journalist who, over the next five years, somehow managed to bind the \u2018mystics and the mechanics\u2019 into a group with a single purpose, often at huge cost to himself.\nAlongside a group of passionate and idealistic young friends, Hunter was instrumental in creating the global organization we now know as Greenpeace, changing the way we look at the world and our place within it.\nA prizewinner at Sundance Film Festival, How To Change The World draws on interviews with the key players & stunning footage of their jaw-dropping actions, bringing these extraordinary characters and their intense, sometimes eccentric & often dangerous world alive.\nThe Filmmakers & Family of Bob Hunter at the Canadian Premier, Hot Docs International Film Festival\nWHY DO WE NEED THIS STORY NOW?\nAt a time when we need to engage with environmental & wider political problems on a global scale, this story of the impact one small group of people can get us thinking not only about how we act individually but in partnership with each other. The film is launching in the lead-up to the Paris UN Climate Summit - the most important global meeting on climate change this decade. Our aim is to inspire a new generation to believe in our ability to make change with as many worldwide screenings as possible.\nBOB HUNTER -  A life well spent for the planet\nBOB HUNTER is the main character of our film and a visionary icon in the movement. He joined Greenpeace for the first campaign against nuclear testing, and thereafter became the leading figure in the movement. As the organization\u2019s first president, his media savvy and political ideas helped define the character and methods of early Greenpeace. He led the first anti-whaling campaigns, which led to a ban on commercial whaling. Later on, Hunter began a career as environmental reporter for Toronto\u2019s CityTV and published 13 books. In 2005, he passed away from terminal cancer, but his legacy still lives on today \u2026\nScene from the film of Bob Hunter, first president of Greenpeace and main character of the film\nREWARDS - exclusive to Kickstarter\nWe have lots of great rewards as thanks for supporting our worldwide release.

Because we want to make the world more beautiful by saving important resources and offering products made from the best alternative to traditional paper. A material made out of waste products - stone paper. \nWe will offer hardcover and softcover ROCKBOOKS in three different patterns. And we'll make your 'familiar', usually boring stationery but then stylish, like ROCKVELOPES, ROCKPADS, POCKETROCKS, ROCKMEMOS, and we might even offer ROCKCUPS. So actually, anything you can think of stationery-wise, we will make. From stone. \nBut we\u2019re not there yet\u2026\nWe\u2019re just getting ready to ROCK\u2026\nWhy this Kickstarter campaign?\nWith this Kickstarter campaign, we want to fund our first project: the METAMORPHIC ROCK TOOLS debut collection, that holds all the basic stationery we use in daily life, to realise ambitions and let creativity roam freely.\nFrom product designs, to testing samples, to realising the first product and building up relations with manufacturers, we\u2019ve done it all. We work closely together with the innovator of stone paper in Taiwan, as well as a very experienced production facility. Both were visited by our ambassadors, who are of invaluable importance to us, and who assist us in all our activities. So, we\u2019re all set.\nBut we need a community of ROCKSTARS to help us start to make a change, and make it last.\nRight now, we need to start doing things differently, to keep our planet a healthy place for future generations. The paper industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, and a suitable alternative exists: stone paper. So, why not start using it on a bigger scale? That\u2019s where On The Rocks comes in.\nWe believe that saving invaluable resources such as water and trees, thus the air we breathe and the soil we live on, is of vital importance. By offering this first Metamorphic ROCK TOOLS collection to a community of ROCKSTARS, we can make a contribution.\nBut there's more. We will donate 5% of our profits to a horizontal reforestation foundation in South Africa. We promise to be good by doing good. That\u2019s also why we're on our way to become a Pending Benefit Cooperation\nand we're building a social community of Rockstars! Come find us on Twitter and Facebook & share the love!\nWith various experiences in entrepreneurial projects, working experience in marketing and community-building (but a background in European Law and History...) Anne is the leading force behind On The Rocks. \nThe creative brain and design rockstar involved, is Sietse. With over 10 years of working experience in design, illustrations, UI development and brand building, he brings with him a lot of talent and experience. \nEva is our website/webshop- and social-media mastermind. She really knows how to rock the digital world. Having worked in these areas for a host of different companies she now also joins our team of rockstars. \nWithout the help of talented photographer Philip we wouldn't have been able to show you our prototypes this stylishly. We're already looking forward to his pictures rocking the stage in our future projects.\nOur movie was made in cooperation with the very talented people from Cloudshaped/Arteffects. \nApart from this team, we have Ambassadors that rock! They assist us in everything we do, and fully support our project. We can always count on their guidance and (life)lessons. \nThe details\nWith this Kickstarter campaign, we will be able to produce our METAMORPHIC ROCK TOOLS basics. All designs are finished and ready for production, but funds are lacking. \nWe've already been prototyping our ROCKBOOKS for some time. First, Anne went for a very basic small notebook. \nEven though the result was nice, it lacked 'spice'. So, that's when Sietse and his creative magic came in. He designed three lines of products, based on natural stone formations.\nAnd then we decided, this needed some color to make it rock. \nBecause it's not all about the outside beauty, but also inner beauty, we've added something nice inside the ROCKBOOKS as well. \nTo give you a space to write, doodle and mind map at the same time, the lines in our 64 sheet ROCKBOOKS are very subtle. Just enough for you to see them, but not too much to distract from what really matters - your content. \nBesides that, all our hardcover ROCKBOOKS, will come with a back pocket, a pocket for you to fill with the best memories. \nAnd, all of our hardrock ROCKBOOKS, come with three ribbons. Yay for that! We're sure that with all the things you need to keep track of to make your ambitions and dreams a reality, this will come in pretty handy.\nPlus, what's a hardrock ROCKBOOK without an elastic to close the thing? Can't forget that one.\nFor this campaign, we thus offer our ROCKBOOKS as a reward. Including, one special limited edition! Inspired by - of course - mountains. Very famous mountains indeed, Huangshan in China. \n                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat we will be able to do after this campaign\nMost of the money we raise, will directly be used to produce and ship all rewards. An exciting ordeal for us, also since we are of course very curious to find out your unsalted opinion about your real life ROCKBOOKs!\nThe product designs for all of the other elements of our Metamorphic ROCK TOOLS debut Collection (ROCKPAD, MINIROCK pocket notebook, ROCKVELOPES) are finished, and we will be able to start sampling and producing those. \n We'll also be able to do the plate-making, so that all of our Metamorphic hardcover ROCKBOOK covers can be embossed with the Metamorphic design. Cool, right?!\nAfter production of all of our ROCK TOOLS is finished and we're all satisfied with the quality and how they've turned out, we'll invest in opening up shop for everyone. No worries, we'll make sure, you'll be the first to know so you can keep your pioneer position. Exciting!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter the successful funding of this project, we will be able to launch our METAMORPHIC ROCK TOOLS. But, as with all things in life, sometimes it can get messy. Even when you least expect it.\n\nFor us, there are a couple of interesting challenges ahead. \n\n- Shipment: we will ship worldwide, but will of course do the final-final-final quality check ourselves, and will pack all the rewards for backers ourselves. So that whole logistics part might become challenging. We're in touch with a couple of different shipping agencies right now, to find out how we can get the rewards out as fast and as good as possible.\n\n- Leading production from a distance: We'll manufacture the ROCK TOOLS in Taiwan, close to the source of stone paper. With our previous experiences in working long-distance, sometimes this can lead to miscommunications or is it just very difficult to explain details of our designs. Even though, when really necessary, we can travel to Taiwan, we hope we can deal with this and build further on the great relationship we have with our manufacturers. \n\nApart from that, we can't think of significant risks or challenges. Our designs are solid already, we know what our manufacturer is able to do and know that they will deliver high quality products, made with eco-friendly ink, glue and production methods.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "On The Rocks\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nOn The Rocks was founded by Anne Pleun van Eijsden, an ambitious 27-year old from the Netherlands.

But we've become frustrated at the lack of a mason jar fermentation airlock that will let you \"set it and forget it\", mind the cliche. We wanted to create something that eliminated the need for monitoring your jars everyday, and took care of a bunch of other inconveniences at the same time. \nThe Pickle Pipe has made fermentation easier and more fun and we think you\u2019ll love using it in your own home.\nOne-Piece | Food-Grade Silicone | Waterless\nThe benefits of lacto-fermentation are truly too great to list. They range from promoting strong gut health to improved digestion and nutrient absorption, they have detoxifying powers, and even help reduce sugar cravings. No wonder fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and real pickles are referred to as the modern day Superfoods. \nReal pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut.\nLacto\u00ad-fermentation is an anaerobic process (complete absence of oxygen) which encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria commonly known as probiotics. Exposure to oxygen can encourage the growth of surface scum and microbes and often leads to fermentation\u2019s nemesis: mold. Oxygen can also deprive your ferment of Vitamin C, and lead to soft or soggy food without any crunch as well. For these reasons it is critical that no oxygen is allowed to enter your fermenting environment. \nOnce the process is underway, carbon dioxide is produced as the probiotics convert the natural sugars in your veggies into tasty amino acids (this is what you\u2019re seeing when your jar is bubbling). \nFor these two reasons, an airlock becomes a critical component serving two very important functions:\n1) Allowing carbon dioxide to escape the jar and avoid it from exploding\u037e and\n2) Keeping oxygen out of the jar to prevent mold from spoiling your ferment.\nThe Dos and Don'ts of Lacto-Fermentation\nComplicated, inconvenient, expensive. \nSimply put, current airlock solutions are over-complicated, inconvenient, expensive, and after all that, still require regular maintenance and monitoring. \nSay goodbye to multi-piece airlocks!\nA popular airlock solution uses a three-piece plastic water-filled airlock system whereby gas can escape one way but not re-enter. The problem is the airlock is made from brittle plastic which is prone to breaking and requires an additional three-piece lid mechanism to attach it securely to a mason jar. The end result is a clumsy six-piece contraption which is designed to relieve you of checking on your ferment to \"burp\" it. Ironically, it still must be monitored regularly to ensure the water has not evaporated, allowing oxygen into the ferment, and rendering the airlock useless. \nEven with these drawbacks, these water-based systems regularly sell for over $15 each! And that does not include the inevitable costs to replace a broken airlock from time to time.\nThe Pickle Pipe solves these problems by eliminating the need for multiple components AND the use of water. The Pickle Pipe is a super simple one-piece waterless airlock that allows gas to escape as necessary without letting any contaminants back flow into the jar, and it screws into place using any standard mason jar band. FDA food-grade certified, waterless, dishwasher-safe, and more compact... the Pickle Pipe is the natural evolution of the mason jar airlock. \nOnce screwed into place, you can forget about the Pickle Pipe for days, or even weeks.  \nThere is ZERO maintenance or monitoring required at all.\nWe sent samples of the Pickle Pipe to some incredibly knowledgeable experts in the fermentation community. The feedback they provided helped shape this campaign, and also let us know that we had created something with real value that actually simplifies a key part of the fermentation process. Here's what they had to say: \nJane Campbell, Fermenter's Kitchen\nKate Payne, Hip Girl's Guide to Homemaking\nSharon Peterson, Simply Canning\nMarisa McClellan, Food in Jars\nThe Pickle Pipe relies on a tried and tested engineering component: the one-way valve. One-way valves are designed with the simple purpose of allowing the flow of a material (usually gas or liquid) in only one direction, and preventing it from flowing in the opposite direction. This is the exact objective of an airlock: to allow carbon dioxide gas to flow out of the jar, and prevent oxygen (or anything else) from flowing into the jar. \nHow a One-Way Valve Works\nThe Pickle Pipe is simply placed on top of a mason jar opening and then secured using any standard mason jar screw band (not included). The flexible nature of the silicone provides a perfectly airtight seal with the rim of the jar. The one-way valve works to release carbon dioxide as pressure builds up within the jar during the ferment, and it cannot open to allow oxygen or other contaminants in the other way. It's really as simple as that! \nWe cannot do this without your support and so rewards should be just that: rewarding. Every reward will feature at least one Pickle Pipe, so backing this campaign is the fastest way to get your hands on one (or three, or six!). We're also bundling the Pickle Pipe with some complimentary Masontops fermenting tools, at up to 40% off standard pricing! \nBest of all, we are confident that we can deliver these rewards by December 25, in time for the gift giving season.     \nWe started masontops.com a year ago to help bring our first fermentation product to market: Pickle Pebbles. We saw a need for a product that was made with quality and consistency, and we delivered on those attributes. We are now the leading seller of glass fermentation weights in North America and the Pickle Pebbles have received a 94% approval rating across hundreds of reviews. This is only mentioned to demonstrate that we have a track record of delivering an excellent customer experience around a product that we manufacture. After the success of the Pebbles, we set our sights on another product that was being under-served in the market: The Pickle Packer - a vegetable tamper made from all natural Acacia wood and designed to work with regular and wide mouth mason jar ferments. The Pickle Packer has quickly become a hit with our customers, with a 98% approval across dozens of reviews in just a few short months since being introduced. \nWe love mason jar fermentation. We understand it, and we have a proven track record of developing and manufacturing high-quality products. \nExisting products have been very well received.\nWe've spent nearly a year, hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars getting to this point. 3D design engineers, testing out various valve types and sizes, silicone shore hardness levels, and much more. The Pickle Pipe is finally designed, tested, and ready to go... but production molds for silicone products are quite expensive, and the minimum order quantity is rather high if we want to bring the price of the unit down to something affordable. \nThis Kickstarter campaign has two purposes: (1) to gauge the interest in the Pickle Pipe, and (2) to help offset some of the initial expenses of bringing this product to market. We are so grateful for any assistance received that help accomplish either of these goals. \nLots of ways! In addition to taking advantage of the great rewards being offered, you can share your feedback on the product with us and with your friends and families! Tell your favorite blogger about this campaign! Follow us on Facebook and Twitter! Every bit helps and we're so appreciative of your support. \nDeveloping this product and this Kickstarter took many many hours and was truly a collaborative effort. First and foremost, we have to thank our families for being so supportive of this project and the many late nights that it demanded. In no particular order, we'd like to extend a heartfelt thanks to the following people and organizations as well:\nKickstarter Video - Jesse Cappe, Big Ticket Productions\nSocial Media Wizardry - Andrew Simon\nGraphic Design - Kelly Lemme, Kelly Lemme Graphic Design\nProduct Development Feedback - Sharon Peterson, Simply Canning | Sarah Nelson Miller, Killer Pickles | Marisa McClellan, Food in Jars | Jane Campbell, Fermenters Kitchen | Kate Payne, Hip Girl's Guide to Homemaking\nYOU!

With over 4,500 backers literally spread across the globe, determining the format of the workshop was a challenge. Hosting it in one physical location, or expecting 4,500 people in different time zones to tune into a live stream at the same time didn't seem like a very equitable (or realistically achievable) solution.

Here's one we built earlier.\nHEAT-1X - 9.3 meters tall, 1.6 tons - designed and built by this team\nKickstarter backers will get exclusive access to a real-life space mission, joining in making key decisions as we design, build and finally launch the Moonspike rocket. You can ask us questions, and give us suggestions that could alter the course of our mission. \nAs a team member you'll have access to some superb rewards, like membership of the Moonspike Academy, access to Mooncamp, a seat at mission control, your own data in the space payload, actual parts from the rocket and numerous limited edition goodies like mission patches, posters, challenge coins and pins. And of course you can follow our progress through video diaries and video chats.\nThe Moon Rocket\nWe looked at literally hundreds of design options and settled on a design using proven space technology with a few modern twists. Our intention is to build a two-stage, liquid-fuelled vehicle that is capable of lifting a small spacecraft into Low Earth Orbit (LEO). We will then send that spacecraft to the Moon carrying our payload.\nThe Spacecraft\nThe spacecraft is the third stage of the vehicle, and has a mass of 147kgs when fuelled. This little vehicle will make the transit from Earth to Moon and end it's life impacting the Moon at around 2,000m/s.\n\nThe spacecraft is largely a container for the volumes of liquids and gases used to push it towards the moon, with communications and guidance electronics, and the tiny, symbolic 1 gram payload attached. When it arrives at the Moon there will be just 35kg of empty spacecraft left.\n\n\nThe Payload\nWe named this mission after this tiny symbolic payload - the Moonspike. We chose a very tiny 1 gram payload as a demonstration, in order to make the problem of building a moon rocket as simple as possible.\n\nThe Moonspike is a tiny spike of titanium that is designed to survive a hard landing with the moon.\n\nIt's important to note that the payload is just a demonstration - the main challenge of this adventure is building and launching the rocket, and sending that tiny spacecraft 400,000km through space to the Moon.\n\n\nThe Journey\nRewards\nShipping for Christmas 2015!\nWe have had several questions about shipping in time for the Holiday season.\nThe images of the mission patch, lapel button and challenge coin are of the actual sample items, not Photoshop - we have already made the tooling, and you are looking at the real thing. This means that if we get funded by November 1, we would order those right way and should be able to ship in time for December 2015 holidays. This also applies the A2 concept art posters.\nSo if you are looking for a great Christmas gift for for your children, nieces, nephews, grandchildren or other space enthusiasts for the holidays, you know which rewards will be available.\nYour memories transported to the Moon\nThanks to the wonders of digital data, even a symbolic 1 gram allows us to carry the hopes and dreams of millions of people. And that\u2019s a core part of what you get from joining this project - you can send (almost) any digital content you want to the Moon.\n\nWhat can you send? A cherished love letter. A beautiful video of your children. A song that reminds you of your wedding day. The novel you once wrote but never published. The movies from your honeymoon. The photo of your mother and father. The home movie of the winning goal. A blessing on your family from the heavens. That software you\u2019ve been working on. Artworks you created in college.\n\nWe can transport your memories, thoughts and dreams to another world, locking it in the Moon for eternity. And in generations to come, your children and grandchildren will be able to look up at the sky and point to that monument.\n\nPhotos of the Earth and the Moon from the Spacecraft\n\nYou are sending an actual spacecraft to the Moon, and because of the novel navigation system, we\u2019re going to be able to send back photos \u2013 not photos shot by someone else, but photos your own spacecraft took during its voyage.\n\nTo commemorate that achievement, the spacecraft will take higher resolution photographs of both the Earth, looking back as we head away, and the Moon as we arrive. And you will get a high quality physical photographic print of each, signed by the team. Each photo will be 5\u201dx7\u201d, suitable for framing, on high quality photographic stock.\nMoonspike Academy\nJoin the team as a Moonspike Academy Member and get a full vote on key issues as we progress, as well as a dedicated smartphone app.\nThe exclusive members-only app will allow you to access team updates one full day before the general public, simulate the mission with a range of engine and payload variables \u2013 allowing you to show your friends what you are supporting - and most importantly vote on choices the team faces at various key stages of the project.\nYou will also be invited to join the annual Academy general meeting in person, and get a personal briefing on project progress.\nAcademy membership comes complete with an Academy membership card and lanyard. Travel not included. \nMooncamp\nJoin the team for a full week on-site at the factory. You will learn about how we design and build rockets, and get hands-on experience in the factory actually building the Moonspike rocket and spacecraft that will travel to the Moon.\nMooncamp will feature interactive sessions from all the key team members, with full details on the challenges of designing spacecraft, how we design and build engines, pump systems, navigations systems, guidance and control mechanisms.\nYou\u2019ll get to design your own moon rocket, with guidance from the team; listen in on team design meetings; and even fabricate actual rocket components that will be used on the rocket and spacecraft.\nIncludes participant t-shirt and Moonspike Academy membership, and runs in the two weeks either side of the annual Academy meeting. A perfect gift for young people who are interested in knowing more about hands on rocket design and fabrication, and an opportunity to build direct experience that might be useful on your resume.\nTravel / accomodation not included. Must be 18 years of age or older.\nMission Patch\nIt\u2019s a simple patch, but comes from a long heritage. Almost every mission into space has its own unique mission patch.\nThe Moonspike patch tell the story of the journey we are planning from Earth to Moon, and also signals to the world that you\u2019re a supporter of open access to space.\nThe custom-made 4\" Moonspike patch is 100% embroidered with an iron-on backing, perfect for overalls, jackets or backpacks.\nLapel button\nFull of vibrant detail, the 1.25\u201d gold-plated lapel button is a specially minted cloisonn\u00e9 pin that shows the Moonspike mission in full color, and discreetly tells the world you are a supporter of open access to space and the Moonspike project.\nEach button is made from a custom casting that is 1.2mm thick, and then plated with 10K gold. Each pin has an 8mm post and a butterfly clutch attachment, to ensure it stays securely on your jacket.\n\nChallenge Coin\nThis specially minted 2\u201d Moonspike challenge coin is a unique memorial of the founding of the Moonspike project.\nChallenge coins are a very old military and aeronautical tradition, with astronauts using mission coins to win bets - challenges - or make small crewing decisions. Even the President of the United States has his own challenge coins, in case of a \u201cchallenge\u201d when on a military base.\nWe\u2019ve recreated that history in the Moonspike challenge coin. It features two unique high gloss faces showing both the Moonspike mission and lunar spacecraft. The coin is finished to a very high standard, with bezel cut edges and nickel plating for robustness.\nPosters  \nCarsten Brandt has created some amazing and gorgeous concept art to illustrate the Moonspike mission, and we are offering superb A2 posters of five of his beautiful creations.\nCarsten works as an art director in the video game industry, and his credits include the Watchmen series. He also teaches video game design at the Danish Royal Academy of Fine Arts.\nThe Moonspike posters will be delivered rolled, rather than folded, to avoid any creasing, and will be printed on high quality stock to ensure they stand the test of time.\nLogo on the Rocket\nIt\u2019s the ultimate. Nothing could be more exclusive than your name on the side of a Moon rocket.\nAnd we have limited spaces, to ensure that backers that choose this reward are highly visible. Logo placement can be selected on the two stages, in two different formats. \nIt\u2019s expensive, but if you want to get your brand in a premium position on a Moonshot, this is what you are looking for.\nA Thruster in Your Name\nThe Moonspike spacecraft features 8 thrusters, and we want to give them some personality. So we\u2019re letting you choose what to call them.\nName it after your loved ones, your pet, your favorite place, your company \u2013 you choose. And from then on, we will refer to that thruster with that name in all designs, publications and documents.\nThere are some restrictions, but if it\u2019s acceptable it will fly.\nWhy back us?\nExperience\nWhile there are probably thousands of people on the planet who have theoretical knowledge of what it takes to build rockets, very few have hands-on experience of building and launching large-scale rocket vehicles.\nBut the team we have gathered have both professional training with organizations like NASA and hands-on experience building rockets at Copenhagen Suborbitals, a private team of amateur rocket builders who designed and built several very successful rockets on a shoestring budget during the past 7 years.\nThe vehicles this team have designed and launched include the 9.3m tall, liquid-fueled HEAT-1X, and the actively guided 5.3m Sapphire rocket. \nTransparency\nA typical space project will be quite secretive. We\u2019re going to be almost the exact opposite.\nWhatever happens, good or bad, we\u2019re going to be open about it, through blogs, videos, and interviews. \nInstead of hiding behind a wall, we'll let you see exactly where your support is going on a very regular basis.\nAdventure\n50 years ago sending rockets to the Moon was a genuinely amazing thing. The glory and power of the incredible Saturn V rocket ascending from the launch pad with 3 tiny, courageous human astronauts on board inspired and awed a generation of kids.\nWhen we were kids, there was a wondrous awe about space voyages, something that has been missing from the modern era. We want to get back to that feeling, of just doing this thing for the sheer joy of watching it climb into the sky and hopefully, eventually, land on the Moon.\nWhether we succeed or fail, this project is intended to be a fascinating, awe-inspiring adventure for all participants, and that includes our supporters.\nFocus\nMany space projects are very ambitious, with vast budget requirements. This is typically driven by trying to launch people or enormous spacecraft with extraordinary goals, and need billions of dollars.\nWe\u2019ve figured out a way to make a real space mission possible on a reasonable budget by focusing on a relatively simple and highly focused goal \u2013 just get something small to the Moon.\nWe think this will allow us to achieve real results. We know that we will need to raise more money the course of the project, and this Kickstarter helps us get started.\nEngineering\nWhen we thought about what it is we are trying to do, we figure it is more of an engineering task than anything else.\nMost of the technology is well documented and understood today; our challenge is making that work with a small team and a micro budget instead of NASA's billions.\nMostly it's about finding smart solutions to classic engineering issues, and that's why the pragmatic, hands-on experience of the team is crucial. \nCredentials\nOne key aspect that makes Moonspike truly unique and unusual is the track record of the engineering team in designing and building space rockets.\nAlmost all of our team come from key roles within the Copenhagen Suborbitals project, which has been one of the most successful and widely regarded amateur space projects ever \u2013 in fact collectively the Copenhagen Suborbitals team won a prestigious Breitling FAI medal for their extraordinary work on a miniscule budget. Those guys are awesome.\nMoonspike is going to continue that heritage, with a budget that gives the team an opportunity to build equally innovative and adventurous space hardware to professional standards.\nFeasibility study\nAs we said above in the transparency section, we want to be very open about what we are doing on this project, and this starts today. \nWe\u2019ve been working hard to develop our rocket and space-craft designs over the past few months and today we are opening up our feasibility study document to the public for you to review the design and understand the considerations we have worked though in the past months. \nYou can download the complete feasibility study document to review the mission, technology and design here. \nWe invite you to download these technical specifications today and check our calculations. \nWe hope you understand that we have made many design decisions and trade-offs to get to this initial design, which has a very specific purpose, so it\u2019s unlikely we will change the design significantly unless we have made some fundamentally erroneous calculations. \nNaturally if you spot any mistakes or issues we would be happy to hear from you.\nWhere will the money go?\nBasically we will use your support to get this thing off the ground, literally.\nUntil now we have spent about 9 months preparing. We raised some seed money to get this far, and now we need the Kickstarter community backing to get us up and running, to the point that we can test some of the most critical sub-systems like turbo pumps and navigation systems, and fire our first engines. \nThe main goal of this funding will be to get our factory set up, install the core members of staff, and start designing, developing, building and buying components to start actually making the rocketship.\nRent a rocket factory \nWe have already scoped out a candidate for our premises, and we will sign up for a 1-2 year lease with the one that seems to be the best fit it funded. \nEquip the workshops\nOnce the factory is available we will equip it with all the basic machines we need to start producing rockets and spacecraft - lathes, CNC machines, drills, welding tools etc.\nBuy materials and components\nA large percentage of the money we raise through Kickstarter will go directly into buying materials and components needed to design, develop and actually build the rocket.\nPay staff\nWe need a focused, dedicated team working on this project. So we want you to know transparently that some of the money will go towards paying staff (and income taxes).\nStart building\nOnce we have made initial purchases of equipment and materials, most cost are the basic running costs of a small rocket factory \u2013 electricity, internet, rocket fuel, liquid oxygen etc. With the money you generously provide we expect to be able to start taking this project 100% seriously and build some amazing machines. In parallel your support gives us a cash runway to generate the next round of funding from other sources. \nKickstarter is a going to get us off to a great start, and we\u2019re also working on many other avenues of funding to ensure we can fulfil our promises to you and get your data, pictures, movies, stories onto the Moon. \nTimeline\nWe\u2019re ready to get going \u2013 in fact some of our team members have already started work, in the expectation that Kickstarter supporters will be right behind us.\nWe have spent the past 9 months figuring out if this was actually possible and the numbers all check out.\nThe only component we are missing is your participation and help. By the end of 2015 we hope to have the rocket factory up and running, and by late next year we want to be able to start firing test engines. \nWe\u2019d love to have you all along for the ride, and ultimately transport your data to the Moon.\nWe\u2019re going back to the Moon. Why not join the team today?\nPhoto credits: NASA, Copenhagen Suborbitals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMoonspike is an exciting and ambitious project. Owing to the nature of its size, scale and complexity (not to mention all of the unknowns of space and lunar exploration which we hope to learn about on the way) Moonspike is bigger and more complicated than the average Kickstarter project and so there are more risks and challenges involved and a few extra considerations in addition to those provided on Kickstarter\u2019s website. By making a pledge to Moonspike\u2019s Kickstarter project, you agree to accept the risks as we\u2019ve defined them below, and any other risks known or unknown, even if they are not explicitly stated herein. \n\nWe may have to request further information from Backers to enable delivery of the rewards; change the dates on which we estimate that the project will be finished or we will be able to deliver rewards; or make other changes. Moonspike Limited will do its best to notify you of any such changes via Kickstarter.com, its website, and/or any an email address that you provide. All questions or disputes regarding eligibility for and delivery of pledge rewards will be resolved solely by Moonspike Limited and within the legal jurisdiction of the UK.\n\nMoonspike is a unique project with many contingent parts including design, engineering, mission control, regulation, legal and financing. This Kickstarter project is to raise the funds to set up the basic infrastructure to begin developing and testing prototype parts and systems. To be clear, this Kickstarter campaign is not intended to fund the entire development process or mission. You are funding a design and development process, the initial goal of which is to begin real work on hardware and software. The final rocket launcher and spacecraft may differ from current designs and imagery. Our project may also be influenced by the Kickstarter process, and may change following the campaign based on input from technical review, regulatory oversight or commercial commitments.\n\nThe launch and operation of a new, experimental space launch vehicle and spacecraft is technically complex and involves many risks beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s control. Moonspike Limited is not responsible for any failure to perform all or part of the Kickstarter project if such failure is caused by third parties and events or conditions beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s reasonable control. This includes but is not limited to explosions, spillages, accidents, acts of nature, war, civil disturbances, acts of civil or military authorities, legal or regulatory changes, asteroid impacts, alien interference, loss of radio or other communications signals, or other causes beyond Moonspike Limited\u2019s control. \n\nAdditionally, and due to the extremely experimental nature of the project, Moonspike Limited cannot be held liable for failure to perform all or part of the Kickstarter project due to errors or omissions in the design and manufacture of the launch vehicle or spacecraft.\n\nManaging the processing of many thousands of photos, videos, and data files will require automation, and we will be building a platform help simplify and streamline content uploading. No submission will be accepted outside this automated process. All Backers whose pledge contains data transport rewards will be responsible for the integrity of their own content prior to uploading. Any content supplied may be scanned for viruses or other harmful or malicious attributes. All data or images may be visually inspected for explicit, offensive, illegal or copyright infringing content.\n\nTo obtain a reward a Backer must be verified following the completion of a successful Kickstarter campaign and the full pledge payment received.

They should be in every hardware store.\" - Sylvia Earle, National Geographic Explorer-In-Residence and TED Prize Winner\nAfter four years designing and piloting underwater drones, we've taken everything we've learned and completely re-imagined what an underwater drone could be. Trident has a unique design that combines the versatility and control of an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) and the efficiency of an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). It can fly in long, straight survey lines called \"transects\" as well as perform delicate maneuvers in tight spaces, all while maintaining a sleek and powerful form factor.\nTrident is easy to use and comes ready to go. Most importantly, it is incredibly fun to fly. (Flying really is the best term, because that's exactly what it feels like when you're piloting.)\n(or email press@openrov.com)\n                Our Story\nYou may remember us. We came to Kickstarter three years ago and shared our dream of building a low-cost underwater robot that would allow anyone and everyone to explore the world below the surface. We have come a long way since that initial Kickstarter video. \n\nWe were working out of Eric's garage at the time, building the original prototype to explore a cave in Northern California with rumors of lost treasure (the full story can be heard in this TED talk). We never found the gold, but we received messages from people all over the world who wanted to help us and improve the robot. The Kickstarter project was the springboard. Since then, we've shipped thousands of OpenROV kits to people all over the world. \nPLAY\n\n Community\nThe OpenROV community is the secret sauce. We made our project open source in order to facilitate faster innovation cycles and allow others to improve on our initial designs. Thousands of people have gotten involved. You can see and follow along with the community expeditions on OpenExplorer. \nA glimpse of the OpenROV community\nTeam\nWe've also assembled a small team that works from our OpenROV HQ in Berkeley, CA to manufacture, ship and support the robots. The combination of community wisdom and the commitment of our internal R&D team (many of whom were original Kickstarter backers) have been the drivers in creating Trident. \nOpenROV Team\nAt OpenROV, we talk openly about our desire to maximize \"Return on Adventure.\" We want to make sure that everyone who comes in contact with our project - community members, customers, employees, whoever - feels that their world is more interesting and more exciting because of it. We want to give people a sense of wonder about how much out there is yet to be explored and make it possible for anyone to be a part of exploring it. Trident is our best attempt yet to fulfill that promise.\nOpenROV 2.8 vs. Trident\nTrident Performance\nEvery aspect of the Trident design has been painstakingly thought out in order to optimize performance and usability in any situation. One of the secrets of its versatility is the unique, hydrodynamically offset thruster design. This configuration allows you to move through the water fast and efficiently when you want to rapidly search an area or run a transect, but also allows you to maneuver very delicately when in tight quarters or while looking at a particular target.\nBy taking advantage of drag's exponential relationship with velocity, the off-center vertical thruster of the ROV can cause it to pitch at high speeds but also hover or change depth without pitching while operating at low speeds - similar to the way a traditional ROV works. \nWe've designed Trident to be ultra portable and ultra durable. The form factor is small enough to fit in a backpack or fit under an airplane seat. The side panels are overmolded with a strong, rubber coating, which gives it protection from underwater obstacles as well as rough handling when being transported.\nDepth: Capable of 100m (will ship with a 25m  tether - longer tethers will be sold separately)\nMass: 2.9 kg\nTop Speed: 2 m/s\nRun Time: 3 hours\nTrident Dimensions\nThe data connection to Trident is a major evolution from the connection set up of the original OpenROV kit. It uses a neutrally buoyant tether to communicate to a towable buoy on the surface (radio waves don't travel well in water) and the buoy connects to the pilot using a long range WiFi signal. Using a wireless towable buoy greatly increases the practical range of the vehicle while doing transects and search patterns since a physical connection between the vehicle and the pilot doesn't need to be maintained. You can connect to the buoy and control Trident using a tablet or laptop from a boat or from the shore.\nSoftware\nOur goal is to make the easiest, most intuitive telerobotic control system possible. We have embraced the latest emerging internet standards from HTML5 and webRTC to WebVR and WebGL to deliver a rich piloting experience through just a browser that runs on laptops, tablets, and modern mobile devices.\nThe software that drives Trident is a living open-source project (https://github.com/openrov/openrov-software). The same software that drives our previous ROV has been continually updated by both the community and our software team. Some of those changes included:\nSoftware plugins that allow any ROV enthusiast to deliver improved ROV capabilities to the whole OpenROV community via small Internet delivered update packages. \nUI Themes so that you can change the look and feel of the piloting experience. \nDepth and Heading hold. Until recently, only a feature on high end industrial ROVs, now available to everyone.\nWith Trident we are focused on an amazing out-of-the-box experience. We are reviewing every bit of the user experience regarding our software to ensure the most simple and intuitive experience possible.\n WHAT'S INCLUDED\nIn each of the reward levels for a Trident, the basic package will include:\nTrident. The actual drone, ready-to-dive.\nA 25m (82 ft) tether. There's a lot to see in the first 25m of depth. For many people, that will be enough. Tethers will be removable and upgradeable if you need to go deeper.\nA wifi topside buoy. The tether connects to a wifi topside buoy. You can use this to control the ROV remotely by setting it on the water or just leaving it on the boat or dock. \nBatteries. Trident comes with onboard LiFePO4 batteries, providing a run time of over 3 hours.\nADVENTURE SET ADD ON* (add $350 to any pledge level):\n*You can always get this later if you're not sure. Or only add for either the hard case or longer tether.\nHard Case. ($100 Add On) Trident will come in a sturdy package/box, but the Adventure Set will have a hard case for travel and shipment. \nAND/OR\n100m Tether. ($250 Add On) Know you want to go deep? Get the 100m tether right out of the gate.\nUSE CASES\nWe built Trident to be the ultimate tool for explorers. But we also wanted to make sure that it was useful for a whole host of utilities. One of the most interesting new features - something that sets Trident in a class of its own - is its ability to conduct long transects, meaning it can run lawn mower patterns over large areas. \nThe benefit of this type of coverage is that you can create visualizations of what the seafloor looks like using photogrammetry software to create a 3D model of the work area. Here's an example from the Fiskardo Greece Expedition run by our friends at OCTOPUS Foundation and Novalta: \nFiskardo Greece Visualization\nWhen overlaid on top of aerial drone footage, these visualizations create a \"window on the sea.\"\ncredit: Fiskardo Greece Expedition - Ocean 71\n\nIt's also a great tool for boat owners and fishermen. Whether you want to inspect an anchor line or look for shipwrecks, Trident gives you eyes underwater and adds a whole new dynamic to the experience of being on the water. \nSponsor a High School\nThe OpenROV Club at Oakland High\n\"The OpenROV project was a winner -- igniting my inner city students' enthusiasm for exploration, taking on academic and technical challenges and developing resilience to over-come set-backs.\"\n-Katie Noonan, Oakland High School\nOne of the most exciting parts of the OpenROV project has been the number of high school classes and students that have taken part. The project provides an incredibly well-rounded education experience: mechanical and electrical engineering, programming, physics, biology, ecology, contributing to an open source community, and just getting outside into nature. \nThe OpenROV kit (not Trident - the previous model of kit) is still an excellent tool for education (and other uses that require the hack-ability). We have a long list of well-deserving classrooms that can do wonders with a donated OpenROV kit. The reward pledge at the $1,000 level will further our efforts here. It will allow us to send a kit and build materials to one of these schools. \nIf you're a resource-constrained teacher who'd like to be added to this list, please email info@openrov.com with the subject \"I'm a teacher!\"\nWhere We're At\nDevelopment Prototypes\nWe have spent the last two years developing the Trident, engineering dozens of prototypes to get to what you see today. We are currently working on refining the final design and tuning it for manufacturing with veteran mechanical engineers and industrial designers.

This would allow us to reach more people and be involved in many other programs and events.\nWe want to upgrade our current equipment and purchase new equipment.  By upgrading and acquiring new tools, we will be able to reach more children and be able to have more kids have a hands on experience.\nWe desire to purchase educational equipment such as computers and projectors to help in our education process.

In the past, many men traveled to distant lands in an effort to gain knowledge and establish new lives for themselves.  Earth will not be around forever and our next great adventure will be to planets way beyond our own. With your help, we hope to inspire many youth to start looking to the future.  Astronomy uses everything they are taught in school from Science to Math and even Reading.  Let's utilize what they are learning and allow them to start thinking outside what lies in our own atmosphere.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe largest obstacles we have consist of a lack of interest due to a lack of budgets by local schools. Because of the lack of school funding, many schools do not have much educational opportunities for the children to learn about what lies beyond Earth. I have been personally surprised by how many young people know absolutely nothing about space at all. In heavily populated ares, many have not even seen a star due to man made lighting that blocks out the natural beauty of a night sky. We offer an educational experience to young people that otherwise may they never receive. Without funding, COAS will continue to be limited in what we are able to teach young and old alike. Seeing a young child see the mountains on the moon, Jupiter, Saturn, or even the Andromeda Galaxy for the first time is very rewarding to us and makes everything we do worthwhile.\n\nCOAS has been actively visiting local schools with various educational programs for a few years now. If funding is not reached to expand our program into a more mobile system, we will continue to move forward with what we are doing until we are able to acquire the needed funding.\n\nIn regards to risk, there really isn't any that we can find. The work that our volunteers do in everything we are involved in is fantastic. There is no sales goal to meet, we are not affected by any economy other than funding. If we cannot afford something, we simply do other things that are more affordable at this time.\n\nThe challenge set in front of us if we are able to obtain the funding we are pursuing is merely getting everything put together. Once we get a vehicle to create a mobile classroom, we have that work to get the mobile unit up and running. Rest assured myself and my volunteers are ready and very excited about what the future holds for us.

I have allowed the levels to reward the player through learning, allowing you to enjoy each level and progress naturally. Also, I am using the accelerometer to allow the player to tilt the device to steer the jet rather than using your finger, or buttons. This will allow the player to be able to use power ups and see the screen for oncoming enemies and blockades.\nLost in... Somewhere - Kala was out on a test flight with her F-317 jet, when all of a sudden, nothing. She blacks out. When she woke up after what seemed like hours, she looks around. Nothing is familiar. She sees stars and planets off in the distance.. but that's impossible! No, it's improbable. She has entered some sort of multiverse, where oxygen exists in this space-like environment. Go on! Move forward! She needs your help, warping through multiverses, in order to get back to Earth's multiverse!\nUnique Multiverses - Every multiverse is unique. From space to candy, to office worlds to hamburgers; you just never know what the next multiverse will bring!\nAvailable for Android Devices - With the initial funding, I will be able to finish production and publish the game to Android devices, with the help of another artist and a sound/music designer. Should I meet the stretch goals, I will be able to get a build for iOS ready, as well!\nabout Epicurus Unvorsum kickstarter\nAs her computer, your mission, for this game is to help guide Kala through the game's multiverses, and get her back to Earth's multiverse.\nEimear Studios wants to create a mobile game for everyone to enjoy, kids to adults, males and females. I have done this by keeping the game idea simple, and relying on core game play, quality 2D sprites, and quality classic 8-bit gaming music for the player\u2019s enjoyment. Everything that makes a great game.\nThe game, by definition is a hellfire/SHMUP game (lots of bullets), but instead of being so insanely difficult that you would want to break your phone, we have developed the levels to allow the player to naturally learn with the game's progression.\nMany hellfire games were designed in the old arcade days, where the goal was to get you to spend more quarters in the machines. Our goal is not to make you spend quarters, but to feel a sense of accomplishment by progressing through the game. Power ups will be available as rewards and to purchase, but they will not be required for a player to play and complete the game.\nhow does Epicurus Unvorsum kickstarter game work\nepicurus unvorsum uses the accelerometer to move the hero's jet\nControls: The game is mobile based, using the accelerometer to control Kala's jet. Tilt your device to move your jet around the screen! This allows the player the freedom to use a finger to select a power up or two (or three or more) to use during gameplay. The jet auto fires, since we don't want you to break your mobile screen, power tapping it.\nepicurus unvorsum for android mobile\nPlatforms: It is currently being built for Android mobile. If I make it to the Stretch Goals, I will be able to make a build for iOS!\nStyle: The game is a top-down viewport, arcade style hellfire/SHMUP game. It is made of 2D sprites.\nLevels and Multiverses: Currently, there are 3 levels per multiverse, with 10 multiverses. Each multiverse is unique, with new enemies, background assets, and blockades. Each multiverse ends with a boss level.\nPlayer Challenges: As the player progresses through each level, the levels will become more difficult, as will the enemies. The challenge is to become familiar with each of the enemies and level obstacles and progress with the difficulty of them.\nPower Ups and Weapons: The power ups and weapons are available for the player to use at the bottom of the screen. They can be purchased via the in game store and earned for free. There is nothing in this game that a player is forced to buy in order to proceed through and complete the game.\nBoss Battles: There are 10 unique boss battles, each with an increased  difficulty and battle style. The battle styles will play based on what the player has learned throughout the multiverse's levels. \nEpicurus Unvorsum development for kickstarter\nWith this game, I plan to develop in close networking with a community of players, and shortly after the Kickstarter completes I will open the game to backer-only early access Beta. I will rely on my backers to give feedback on the mechanics as I develop, with you as a backer playing a pivotal role in the creation of the game.\nEpicurus Unvorsum kickstarter project timeline\nDesign - done \nAlpha Playtesting - in progress \nGraphic Design - done \nPrototyping - done \nBeta Playtesting - soon after the Kickstarter ends \nEditing - in progress \nArtwork - in progress \nProduction Proofing - in progress \nDomestic Test Mailing - done \nInternational Test Mailing - done \nKickstarter Crowdfunding - Thursday, September 24 - Saturday, October 31 \nFunds Deposited - estimated Tuesday, November 17 \nPrint Run Commissioned - estimated Wednesday, November 18 \nUSA Rewards Delivered - estimated beginning Thursday, March 31 (NOTE: It may take 23 days after the postmark.

This project involves bringing to life The Spectacled Eider, who serves as the author of the book. The Spectacled Eider figure appears in the form of an animatronic puppet. He will travel with his trusty, life-sized polar bear companion, a costumed character mascot. The Spectacled Eider will ride inside a backpack on the polar bear's back. The animation and interaction between the child and the \u201cauthor\u201d will be something they have never seen before. All eyes will be drawn toward the polar bear ambling along with a talking duck, engaging in conversations with children. The Spectacled Eider will encourage the children to ask questions, while teaching them to think by advocating philosophical enquiry and promoting logical reasoning. The Spectacled Eider will offer lessons on virtues, values, and morals\u2014involving youngsters in thoughtful contemplation and problem solving.\nClick image and select \"open photo viewer\" to enlarge\nKingfisher and Wren will provide value to those concerned with the dilution of children's literature and its subtle effect of dumbing-down our youth. The book makes it possible to raise the bar in order to share stories with true meaning and value to children. Absent from today\u2019s discourse is the sense of reasoning and contemplation. Concerned parents constantly witness the extent of the media\u2019s meaningless entertainment focused on capturing attention and marketing products to children. Parents can use some straightforward guidance that helps them teach children personal awareness, responsibility, and accountability. The result will produce individuals who are able to think and express themselves in a more articulate manner. Consider the consequences of the alarming popularity of books which have simpler sentence structure, lower word count, and a simpler vocabulary. At a time when children should be developing discipline, vocabulary, patience, curiosity, and a sense of wonder, they are instead emulating and developing selfishness, greed, vanity, and narcissism.\nClick image and select \"open photo viewer\" to enlarge\nThose seeking to expand children's minds, while challenging the ideas broadcast by global corporation advertisements, will greatly appreciate this book. It\u2019s time to encourage children to believe in themselves, because they are capable of incredible things! We need to listen more and lecture less, because children are often smarter than many people give them credit. As we help children develop into free thinkers, we will reap the benefits of their clarity of thought and expression I believe children are natural philosophers and are instinctively asking questions such as, \"How is this?\" and \"Why is that?\" Questioning the world around them not only increases their general knowledge, it prevents them from becoming \"Sheeple People,\" who willfully walk around accepting everything that is happening to them, including anything that could be bad.\nClick image and select \"open photo viewer\" to enlarge\nKingfisher and Wren will encourage children to come to terms with a broad range of personal, moral, and social issues. The book aims to counter non-critical thinking, prejudice, poor judgment, and apathy towards unconventional ideas, and forces us to examine our thoughts and beliefs. The verses stimulate creative thinking and new ideas. Many books today train children to think in fallacious or illogical ways. My hope is to provide children with literature of value that relates to the world in which we live, as well as provides metaphors for our own lives. My goal is to engage readers in five important thinking skills: information processing, reasoning, inquiry, creative thinking, and evaluation. These can be used to stimulate philosophical inquiry and engage children in thoughtful discussions.\nThe Spectacled Eider character study/ Animatronic puppet study\nMy verses can be enjoyed on one level, but as thoughts develop, deeper layers of the stories will be discovered. Many of my verses are what scholars refer to as\"'polysemic\"\u2014which means having the capacity to relate the concerns and needs of people at different stages of development. Celebrated stories of humankind, such as the beloved \"Mother Goose\" stories, have within them layers or levels of understanding and significance,which readers become aware of as they immerse themselves in the writing. As children mature into adulthood they can turn to these verses again and again, for fresh insight about the basic philosophical inquiries about beliefs and  truth, a right and wrong, human relations and the self, which are relevant to people of all ages and at all stages of life.\nBear-Bear character study / Costumed mascot study\nYou can fund this project by pre-ordering a copy of Kingfisher and Wren today. Your support will turn this fantastic idea into reality! Please participate in this great journey by helping spread the message. Be a conduit, if you will, for sharing something truly inspirational and unique for our youth. Encourage your family, friends, co-workers and others to consider supporting this truly unique and valuable children\u2019s book.\nRobin Wooley character study\nWhat happens if I exceed my goal? \nFunds contributed to this campaign will be used for design, development and publication of a magical, yet practical, book for children. It will be used to reach a larger audience to entice them to read, explore and discuss a myriad of topics with children. If I exceed my goal, I have plans to possibly create a video trailer for the book and a webpage showcasing all the characters that will be featured in my series.\nThe Captain of Consciousness Character Study\nThe foundation of this book of verses will create an adventure series that takes place in a small town called Port Clinton (more famously known as Mythic Shores). The star of the series will be \"RuBert (Red) Fischer\" who inspires philosophical enquiry, while promoting good virtues, and charming children with incredible stories of virtue and good morals. Essentially, Kingfisher and Wren is a book showcasing many of the characters that complement the adventure series. Readers have the opportunity to join in and participate in the journey!\nIvory-billed Woodpecker and the Nerfler Beast Character Study\nBiography - The Spectacled Eider\nThe Spectacled Eider is a writer, philosopher, and advocate for continuous learning. He hails from the Yukon\u2013Kuskokwim Delta and enjoys spending time on the Bering Sea. One day while visiting the sunny shores of Lake Erie, he met and befriended two young children. The boy went by the name \"Kingfisher\" and the girl \"Wren.\" They shared their concern about the absurdity of nonsense in the world today. Meaningless entertainment, instead of judicious messages, dominate the air waves. Silly is \u201cin\u201d and smart is \u201cout.\u201d Nothing is gained\u2014children are merely fed drivel when they should be nurtured with useful, honest information. Healthy brains need to be provided ample linguistic nourishment. After listening to the children, the Spectacled Eider understood their concerns. The dissemination of wisdom had been overtaken by silly promotions simply for the sake of a laugh, rather than to provide enlightenment on a subject.\nKingfisher and Wren's first encounter with The Spectacled Eider\nAfter some soul-searching, the Spectacled Eider determined it was up to him to address the problem by finding the solution. (The Spectacle Eider is quite the problem-solver!) It would be a fantastic opportunity to share his wisdom everyone, especially the two little children he met on his journey, as it was they who inspired him to create the book Kingfisher and Wren. He named the book in their honor, because they demonstrated enterprise and inspiration\u2014worthwhile traits for all young people.\nThe Spectacled Eider believes children are extraordinary; their belief system is innocent and their minds are fertile.  With proper nurturing and supervision, their discoveries will guide us to a brighter tomorrow.  As the Spectacled Eider would say, Let us plant the seed of intellect so that it flourishes within children, helping them to reach their full potential. By cultivating a fertile path in their minds, we can help children consume knowledge and wisdom, and gain insight, as opposed to idiocy and nonsense. \nThe Spectacled Eider is clever because he is able to identify sensible communication, void of silly endorsements. His goal is to create inquisitive minds in children through thoughtful encouragement and guidance.  His objective is to raise the bar through interaction and empowerment, which leads to responsibility and accountability.  And most of all, he knows his plan provides the groundwork for imparting good virtues, values, and morals. The Spectacled Eider\u2019s emphasis is on sparking innovation and creativity through imagination as children grow and begin to question the world around them!\nChildren today experience a sense powerlessness. They feel undervalued and incapable of extraordinary achievements. Often their personal interests are overlooked as they are steered toward the next big trend. Careful reflection is pushed to the wayside in order to meet busy schedules. Education should not be a laundry list of skills to check off in boxes. Education needs to be appropriate for the child, family, culture, and community where they live.\nThe Spectacled Eider is dismayed that storytelling today focuses on foolish characters whose main aim is to get a laugh, rather than a wise character who entertains and educates. \nThe Spectacled Eider is saddened by the fact that love, kindness, generosity, and dignity have been overtaken by selfishness, greed, vanity, and narcissism. Even the wisest enjoy a little nonsense now and then, but a constant diet of foolishness will only produce a fool.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDesigning and developing creative projects presents additional challenges not encountered with traditional \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products. Unforeseen hurdles and unexpected costs, along with resistance, doubt, and rejection need to be conquered in order to successfully transform ordinary into extraordinary. \n\nIt is incredibly difficult for independent artists to compete against global corporations with teams focused on marketing, illustration, public relations, distribution, and brand loyalty. Publishing houses have the ability to invest large sums of money to advertise and hype sales through promotions at national chain stores. Not surprisingly, publishers have been known to buy their way onto best-seller lists using perception management to mask value and increase demand.\n\nA solitary author is hard pressed to be able to print, promote, and distribute his or her own work. However, it can be done. Artists often have to rely on external sources supplied by publishers, investment firms, or loans. While these arrangements fulfill an important role in the process, they can be detrimental in terms of artistic control, alteration of the original work, or even cancellation of the publication altogether. \n\nIt is essential that the Spectacled Eider and his sidekick Bear-Bear have a presence in the community, including attendance at public events. The two will visually engage children's interest based on the unique nature of the event. The puppet and mascot will draw the children's attention. Curiosity will compel the children to look into what is going on, as they convince their parents to take them over to the characters. The Spectacled Eider and Bear-Bear know children are a promise for the future, so they perform as cultivators of knowledge by planting seeds for seeking wisdom. The characters will guard the innocent and trusting nature of children, all while providing a better understanding of the world around them.\n\nA child\u2019s biggest fear is a boogeyman. They are wary of an evil trickster who will harm them and steal them away from their home, when in reality the boogeyman man is already inside their home disguised as television, smartphones, computers and advertisements designed to manage their perception and manipulate their behavior. Even more important is that these tricksters lull parents into a false sense of security for their little ones. Vigilant adults will notice the subtle influence of corporations using videos and printed ads promoting products for the masses. These businesses inflate their importance with little resistance or push back by the parents who succumb to the constant barrage of their pronouncements. We must not wait until our children reach young adulthood to address these agents of influence that seek to manipulate them and use them for profits. \n\nMy innovative idea involves working with a puppet designer to create an animatronic puppet that will interact with children, providing them an opportunity to express their thoughts and ideas. It is imperative to create a mascot that is imaginative, yet professional in its appearance and is worthy as an adversary for corporate competition. The project involves collaborating with a puppeteer and costume designer in order that the two work together. The polar bear (costumed mascot) will carry the author (animatronic author) as he converses with children. Beyond creating the costume and puppet, endurance levels for utilizing such equipment must be evaluated and perfected to provide a working environment for its human counterpart. Considerations include donning/doffing, heat/cooling, articulations/vocalizations, and more. Preparation and planning are vital components for achieving a successful costume and puppet.\n\nIn order to accomplish my goal, I am calling on enthusiastic and forward thinking Kickstarter backers to help bring the Spectacled Eider to life, along with his companion Bear-Bear. Are you willing to take a leap of faith in an artist with an unusual idea that I believe will capture the attention of children in a way that will alter play and learning for the better?\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "The Spectacled Eider\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nThe Spectacled Eider is a writer, philosopher, and advocate for learning.

My ex-spouse did not provide the necessary support that was desired, and required, for me to passionately work towards my personal goals.

Even in the Alterations industry, I was taught that there is a way for 'this' body and there is the way for 'that' body, there was minimum wiggle room for individuality because that's \"just the way it is\".\nBut in the year that Sweetlime has been functioning out of my attic apartment and traveling for house calls, I've learned the true lack of comfort people can feel in the search to find clothes that fit their individual shape and style.\nSteph and Karen on their wedding day - both regular Sweetlime clients\n\"Very affordable, very friendly, and most important of all fantastic at alterations! She altered my chiffon bridesmaid dress beautifully!\" - Sammy T.\nSweetlime Alterations was inspired by the people around me everyday; from the trans man that settled on the ill-fitting outfit, to the larger sized women that was made to feel that t-shirts and jeans were her only options.\nSweetlime Alterations strives to be a local business that people can feel safe in. Safety meaning the lack of any kind of judgment that could make a person feel lesser than the human they are. Safety that could give clients the ability to be their truest self in a space that that encourages and supports their individuality\nChristin Rose - Owner of Savvy Seconds & 1sts in Chicago\nSo far, work on building Sweetlime has been incredible; what started as a Queer-centered idea grew organically to different types of people that  were not feeling comfortable in the the clothes they bought, and even the clothes they had already gotten altered. The thing is, I'm hitting a point where I know I can do so much more for the growing community if I had a little help.\nWith your help through this Kickstarter Campaign, Sweetlime Alterations would be able to fund industrial sewing and pressing equipment that would allow me to take on more projects and at a faster rate, secure a storefront with adequate space to both work in and sell clothes and items that support local Queer and marginalized artists and businesses, and possibly even hire individuals that are often overlooked for positions, but have the potential to be Queer Tailors themselves.\nJess Lee - Friend, Client, Radical Femme\nYou can help Sweetlime Alterations become an accessible store front by pledging and receiving your reward or by sharing this project within your own networks.\nThanks for supporting Sweetlime!\n For further updates on what Gabi gets up to, follow Sweetlime on Tumblr @ SweetlimeAlterations.tumblr.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSweetlime Alterations is taking on wide markets [i.e. trans and queer people, people of color, non-standard sizes] that often get overlooked or ignored.

The new layer of sunscreen will make the Sundikator patch clear- it's reusable the whole time you're outside.\nSudikator in opened package\nHow to Use Sundikator?\nBefore going outdoor, peel off Sundikator from backing paper \nGently attach Sundikator to your exposed skin then remove the frame\nApply sunscreen all over, including Sundikator\nHave fun in the sun, Sundikator changes color when you need to replenish your sunscreen\nReapply sunscreen and Sundikator turns invisible. It doesn't re-surface until it\u2019s time to reapply sunscreen.\nThe Sundikator patch takes the guesswork out of sunscreen- it's ideal for children, who can easily forgot when it's time to stop for another layer, for athletes who spend time at the beach, on the boat, or on the links, or for anyone who wants to make sure they have constant UV protection. It also has applications for people with UV sensitivity caused by illness or medication, or have a family history of skin disease.  \nThe sun's harsh UV rays can be blocked by good-quality sunscreen, but it's tricky to know when it's time to reapply. Sweat, water, sand, clothing- all these things can wear down sunscreen's power to protect. When you're having fun in the sun, how do you know when to reapply? Studies suggest every two hours is ideal, but throw in all sorts of other factors and that window isn't accurate enough to ensure that your skin is safe. Studies have also shown that nearly 90% of skin's visible aging is caused by UV rays. The Sundikator patch is for anybody who will be exposed to the sun for long periods of time, whether it's outside at a baseball game, at the pool or the beach, or a day of yardwork. Everyone can benefit from the extra protection.  \nWe also want the Sundikator patch to be accessible and affordable. Right now, we expect the price to be lower than some alternative solutions on the market. The alternatives are single-use only and about $1 per product. We're looking at the same price per unit, but Sundikator can function for more than a week (great for camping and boating trips) as long as it remains on the skin.  \nAiden is wearing an early prototype and ready for outdoor activities\nWe know for a fact the Sundikator patch is great for kids! It was developed when Qian noticed that his two year-old son Aiden often came in from his outdoor activities with sunburns, rashes, and irritation. Though Aiden's daycare teachers applied sunscreen, with all those children to look after it was hard for them to tell when Aiden needed more! That's when Qian, an innovator with an eye for skincare safety, came up with the Sundikator patch. Aiden's skin is feeling much better now, thanks to Sundikator's reminders for new sunscreen!\nHere is a video shows you the early proof-of-concept test!\nPLAY\n\nThe Science of the Sundikator\nAs important as it is to protect your skin from sun damage, it was surprising for us to realize that we were some of the first to take sun protection to the next level. Skin protection through topical application has not changed for decades, so much so that a running joke about the latest method is to grow a Justin Bieber haircut to protect your face from UV rays!\nThe beauty of the Sundikator is that it offers critical information about sunscreen on your skin to avoid accumulative and irreplaceable UV damage. It\u2019s a small, hidden, comfortable little patch that has a medical-grade adhesive base layer that gently attaches to the most sensitive skin. On each patch is a little ink stamp that doesn\u2019t surface until it\u2019s time to reapply sunscreen.\nHere\u2019s the breakdown: the ink molecules absorb energy from sunlight and transform into an active state that produces color when the UV rays are strongest. Once there is no sun exposure, the ink goes back to its normal color. The ink is protected by layers of micro-cells that make it both durable and waterproof so it maintains sensitivity in many different environments. What\u2019s more, the proprietary ink is only activated by sunlight so it stays colorless when you\u2019re indoors.\nPLAY\n\nWe have lined up ink manufacturers, material suppliers and specialty printing companies who are ready to scale up our Sudikator product. Please back Sudikator on Kickstarter and help Qian bring this revolutionary idea to life.\nSundikator Plan\n Sundikator Team\n How will we spend the money?\nFinancial to date\nIf we get additional funding, we will spend money to make Sundikator better, smarter and more accessible to everyone. Here is a list of things we want to do with additional funding.\nFormulate new shade/color\nComplete Sundikator product line\nHire professional management team\nExpand Sundikator to global market\nDevelop products based on Sundikator's technology to address the problem in adjacent market", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1. Finalize our images on the Sundikator.\n\nAs you can see from the video, Sundikator is at its prototype phase, and the images are still generic. We want to put the best imagines and designs on the Sundikator, so everyone can enjoy using it. Thus, delay in determining the imagines can impact the final delivery schedule.\n\n2. Scale-up in printing process.\n\nWe contracted with one of our local printing companies for manufacturing the prototypes. In order to fulfill a larger amount of the orders, we have to develop a way to print larger amount of films in a reasonable time. Since the substrate has a unique surface, it could be challenging to scale-up the printing process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sundikator\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nIt\u2019s a small, hidden, comfortable little patch that has a medical-grade adhesive base layer that gently attaches to the most sensitive skin.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project is canceled": "OCTOBER 7, 2015"}, {"Project launches": "SEPTEMBER 21, 2015"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1116980277/sundikator", "project_name": "Sundikator (Canceled)"}}, {"backer": "Greg Thirtyacre III", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you Omnivore fans and friends for the incredible support over the past 15 days! \nOur initial goal is funded, Omnivore Limone will be soon on the market, and it's now time to announce our first stretch goal of $40.000!\nWe really have a thing for spices.

Absolutely no preservatives or additives will go into our Vulcano. \nWith its bright, savory, complex flavor, and a medium spice level, Vulcano is the perfect condiment to add a little bang to your eggs, potatoes, chicken, burgers, stir-fries, sausages, or to liven up deeping sauces, cocktail sauces, spreads, soups and broths.\nBring Angelo's tradition into your kitchen and help us unlock our second goal!\nNOTE: On Kickstarter, it is only possible to pledge to each project once from a single account.

Within a few months, we shared with you Sicilia a unique condiment sauce, handcrafted and locally made in micro-batches.\nAt Omnivore, our mission is to inspire a change in production practices and a new relationship with food. We are reaching a new awareness about our food supply, but many of the choices in the market are still produced in large-scale, using highly processed ingredients to prioritize profit over quality. \nWe create nutrient-packed cooking products, only crafted in small batches to ensure the best flavor and the highest quality. Our ingredients are 100% organic, and when possible, locally sourced\u2014we are inspired by our grandmothers' sensitivity and respect for nature's bounty, not by food trends.\nWe believe that cooking should be rewarding and simple\u2014all our blends will enhance the natural flavors of your ingredients, and are easy to use across any type of cuisine.\nCooking is an act of love, and we want to inspire you to do more of it.\nIt is time to grow and connect with more of you!\nThanks to the enthusiastic support of our Kickstarters backers and many loyal customers, Omnivore Salt and Sicilia are available online and in a small network of specialty stores. But our aspirations are greater! We want to grow our company, and share our products and message with a larger audience. We proudly have never accepted funding from outside investors. The success of this campaign means we get to continue growing on our terms! \nFor months, we've been experimenting with new blends, testing them in hundreds of recipes, and adjusting each ingredient until the balance was perfect. Now we are ready to present the first of a new series of artisanal seasonings, OMNIVORE LIMONE, a zesty and herbal salt blend that will bring out the best flavors of seafood and poultry!\nWhy Limone?\nLimone is inspired by my heritage, and is a tribute to one of the most versatile ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the lemon. \nI grew up on a citrus grove in Sicily, living by the seasons, cooking, pickling, hunting, and preserving. The women of my family passed down recipes from generation to generation. They taught me the value of timeless quality and great flavors\u2014how to create simple seasonings that do not compete with food, but rather improve it. \nWhile foraging as a child, I learned the wonder of herbs\u2014when mixed with salt, they give character to your food and make your cooking simple!\nMeet the new Omnivore Limone!\nLimone is a mix of of locally harvested natural sea salt and lemon zest, dill, ginger, parsley, garlic, fennel and black pepper.\nEnhancing the most subtle flavors of seafood and poultry, Omnivore Limone creates a delicate and unique experience for the palate.\nIt is made using only 100% organic, GMO FREE, OU Kosher, SQF and HACCP Certified herbs and spices. More than 50% of our ingredients are Fair Trade Certified and our salt is pure\u2014NO flowing agents, minerals or anti-cacking agents are added.\nOmnivore Limone is versatile!\nRub it on white meats or fish before roasting or grilling. Use it in a marinade or mix it with breadcrumbs to create an aromatic coating. Combine it with butter, yogurt, or cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche to give your cooking a Mediterranean twist. Add it to your brines, soups, stewes, and sous vide recipes to enjoy a burst of zesty, herbaceous flavor.\nWith its unique, balanced flavor, Omnivore LImone will revolutionize your cooking, and will become a stample in your pantry!\nUnlike our premier spiced salt blend Omnivore Salt, Limone is not a finishing product. It is best added to your food prior or during cooking in order to rehydrate the dried herbs, and let their flavor infuse your recipes.\nLimone will be sold in a resealable, 6 oz paper bag. This new package is smaller than the original Omnivore Salt, will be easier to carry, will save space in your cabinets, and reduce overall packaging waste!\nMeet the rewards!\nSALT N STYLE - $90+ Bring Omnivore to you kitchen with this comfortable apron made of soft washable denim fabric.

However, most people never actually experience anything more than a screen reflection from their DIY version.\n[for the record this is not a hologram or 3D, but when this is done correctly the illusion appears 3D and most people would commonly conclude that it is a hologram] \nBefore we talk tech, let's answer the questions-\nWhat is it? and Why do I want one?\nThe HoloGram Pyramid is tech gizmo that allows you to view and create images from your phone that appear to float above it with the illusion of a 3D holographic image. You will quickly find yourself amazed and losing hours staring at and sharing this simple marvel of sci-fi reality. Graphic arts and science students can use it to bring their 3D models to life and kids can doze off to the perfect animated night light (you know you have an old phone in the junk drawer just for this). The older kids (at the office) can create company logos or demos to use as giveaways at the next trade show or sales meeting, teachers can add a fun and educational project to the curriculum, and many more exciting uses will be added to our Facebook page! For example; Halloween is coming up, how about amazing the trick-or-treaters with a holographic jack-o'-lantern or skull in your front porch display?\nWe know you will want to show this to everyone once you have one and it's sure to be a hit at your next dinner party or family function!\nNow, let's address the technical aspects of what creates the illusion of 3D Holographic images popping out of your phone-\nRequired criteria;\n1. The image, and therefore the Pyramid, is transparent\n2. There are 4 images, preferably recorded or created with 4 separate views each corresponding to the 4 sides of the object to be displayed.\n3. The Pyramid (square frustum) is correctly designed and positioned to seamlessly depict multiple views of the image from multiple viewing angles.\n4. The outside surface of the Pyramid is the only reflective surface.\nNow that we have established the criteria required to trick your minds eye into thinking that you are seeing a 3 dimensional object floating above your phone, let's address some common issues found in the DIY projects or other available \"clearest holograph pyramids\";\nFirst, the type of material that is used must not be a thick plastic or you may get a reflection off of the outside surface and a second reflection off of the inside of the inside surface which will cause a double blur. \nMost \"other\" pyramids use a cd case or acrylic/plexiglas and cause a double blur image that distorts the image and colors.\nOur HoloGram Pyramid uses a specially coated engineered polymer that produces the best detailed image without double blur issues.\nNext, the material used must be transparent. Using a black glass or mirror can certainly produce a crystal clear image, however, it is only an exact reflection of the image on your phone. This defeats the illusion entirely and will not trick your mind into thinking that you are looking at a Holographic image, just a solid reflection of your phone.\nBlack glass or a mirror can produce great reflections, however; without transparency the eye popping 3D holographic illusion is lost and all you have is a fancy pyramid shaped mirror.\nOur HoloGram Pyramid provides sharp vibrant images that are transparent in order to intensify the \"holographic\" illusion.\nFinally, many of the videos available online are only touching on the illusion by simply displaying 4 identical images on 4 sides. This will provide some degree of the effect when you view the corners and catch a glimpse of 2 sides of a properly aligned image that can be perceived to be 3 dimensional, however, we have found flaws in other's angle and or alignment that cause the 2 sides to jump or be misaligned and also ruin the illusion.    \nNotice how this butterfly seems to have 3 wings and the image is drastically obstructed by the corner support bar. This design completely defeats the illusion and there is no chance for your mental vision to perceive this in 3D.\nOur HoloGram Pyramid was carefully designed with the correct angles and the corners are extremely thin to minimize any visual obstruction. Notice how our UFO shows very little distortion when viewing it from the corner.\nNever fear, we have perfected and produced a very simple design that provides eye-popping, crisp, crystal clear images that will appear 3D with a holographic effect, like you have never seen before from your DIY CD, acrylic, plexiglas, black glass or mirror versions!\nWith our Pyramid we have satisfied all of the criteria needed to produce the full illusion. You may not even realize what you have been missing until you have viewed our HoloGram Pyramid. Viewing from the corners is the key, when you view the HoloGram Pyramid from a corner each eye will focus on each side causing your right eye to see the right image and the left eye to see the left image and if they are aligned correctly THE IMAGE WILL POP INTO 3D from your stereoscopic vision and mental perception! You are now able to see Pepper's Ghost images that look and feel like an actual 3D hologram that is freely floating in space above your phone.\n[An important note- Video of our HoloGram Pyramid is not able to convey the illusion since your screen is only providing you a 2 dimensional image. In order for your mind to switch into 3D perception it is necessary for you to physically view the HoloGram Pyramid in person. Your stereoscopic vision (meaning that you have 2 eyes spaced apart and your brain automatically calculates depth perception which allows you to see in 3 dimensions) can be fooled into believing there is depth and dimension when each eye is presented a separate image that corresponds to 2 sides of an object. By displaying these images on correctly angled reflective surfaces and viewing them from a corner you can be led to believe that 2 2D images equal 1 3D object, adding the transparent factor to the images further reinforces the perception of a 3D hologram. Our video focuses more on showcasing the color and clarity produced by our HoloGram Pyramid but to really see the effect you need to get one! ]\nWe are engineered polymer guys so we know a thing or two about plastics and coatings so this challenge got our attention and it became a fun project to solve.\nWe would like to see more true \"4 faces\" videos that actually use 4 sides of the image to create the best possible 3D effect, perhaps you can get one of our Pyramids and help us create more! We will provide you a link to some existing tools such as an app that is perfect for the novice to tinker with and a link to some free powerful software that is perfect for the overachievers and as this project grows we will be happy to share links to the best videos for viewing. Follow us at HoloGram Pyramid on Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to view and share comments, videos, ideas and perhaps even more if all of our R&D pans out!\nIf you have never backed a Kickstarter campaign here is the perfect opportunity. This is a fun, inexpensive gadget that is a great learning tool for all ages and it makes a great gift!\nWe intend to begin manufacturing as soon as the campaign concludes and is funded. We will do everything we can to expedite fulfillment and we look forward to your comments, videos and links! \nWe have a number of Kickstarter campaigns that we are hoping to launch as soon as our R&D is complete, however; we thought this would be a quick and easy project to use as a test run so we can gain insight on the overall crowdfunding process from conception to fulfillment. Plus this helps us raise the necessary funds to cover our costs to produce and provide an actual working version of this simple but effective illusion and is further allowing us to create an even more exciting new product based on this concept!

Get up to speed here!)\nAbout the Record\nThis is the album I\u2019ve always wanted to make. I recorded in a top-notch facility (Columbus, Ohio\u2019s Relay Recording) with production and engineering wizard Jon Fintel. We spent hours poring over every note and every tone that went into this record. I played all manner of keyboards, percussion, bass guitars, acoustic guitars and electric guitars; friends new and old contributed parts on drum kit, trombone, cello, trumpet and violin; and I turned in my proudest vocal performances to date. This album is packed to the gills with creative energy, and it blows everything else I\u2019ve done out of the water.\nIt\u2019s got some quiet moments: \n And some loud ones: \nSome smooth moments: \nAnd some funky ones: \n Some small moments:\nAnd some massive ones:\nI can\u2019t wait for you to hear the entire thing. That's why I'm giving you the opportunity, dear friends and fans (and dear new Kickstarter recruits!), to be the ones to hear it first\u2014months in advance of anyone else. (For more on that, check out that attractive \"Rewards\" side bar to your right --->)\nAbout Me\n\u201cOne of the best solo acts you'll see in America today.\u201d - Bob Saar, Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame\nI\u2019m the one-man art-rock band from Ohio. I use a technology called looping (a form of sampling) to build my songs live, in front of the audience, in real time. Those who attend my shows get an exciting look into the songwriting and production process, and I get to do what I love without having to worry about anyone else\u2019s availability, drive, commitment or body odor.\nAbout My Mission\nLots of touring acts these days ignore all but the largest population centers, and I think that\u2019s a shame. Music forges community, connects us to something larger, and helps solidify our identities as human beings. So what happens to a person's sense of self when the only music he or she ever gets to hear is manufactured on the coasts and piped in by corporate radio? \nSince 2012, I\u2019ve played shows in 47 U.S. states, many of them in small towns and rural areas. I've done this because I believe that no matter where they live, people deserve access to independent, immediate, meaningful art. \nWhat's Next?\nThe Saturday Giant goes global!\nThis is where you come in. I've proudly funded everything I've done thus far myself\u2014making all kinds of sacrifices on the road to make that possible\u2014but the substantial costs of recording, mastering, and pressing this record to vinyl are sapping all that tour savings. \nTo keep the wheels turning, to fulfill my plans to tour Alaska and Canada (and maybe even Europe and Asia!) next year, to get my music into the hands of national publications and influential radio stations, I need you on board. \nI'm about to take a Giant Leap to share my sounds with music fans who wouldn't have exposure or access any other way, and I literally can't make it without you. Whether you're an old friend, a new fan, or simply a believer in the power of independent art, know that I am flattered, grateful, and above all else, thrilled to have you in my corner.\nIt\u2019s time for The Saturday Giant to meet the world.\nLet\u2019s do this.\nSTRETCH GOALS!\nI want to make sure everyone who pledges gets plenty of value for your support. So if we cross the $10,000 marker, I'm throwing in some additional perks:\n$12,500 - if we reach this goal, I'm throwing a free, backers-only listening party in Columbus the day after the campaign ends, in the recording studio where the album was made. Out-of-towners will receive a free download of my entire back catalog.\n$15,000 - if we reach this goal, I'm playing a free, backers-only show in Columbus.

For the past two years, we (Lynn Tweed and Nate Mellenthien) had envisioned Good Versus Evil as a 12 part comic series.  After truly understanding the immense funding we would have to raise, we decided to instead launch a one-shot standalone comic that will first introduce people to the world of Hal and Eich.  If successful, we plan on creating more content with these two characters, already having planned out the first 12 part comic series as well as some offshoot material and additional storylines.  What we hope to create is an interesting, cohesive universe with characters that will not only be entertaining, but also unique. \nAfter feuding for hundreds of years, Hal and Eich slowly grow resentful and angry at their respective divisions.  After finding a mysterious artifact in a cave upon a falling out, Hal and Eich each find themselves thrust from their realm into modern day earth.  Forced to rely on each other to survive and eliminate a bigger threat, the two will face trials and tribulations that will test their strength, their will, and their convictions.\nOur offering is a one-shot comic book that will show Hal and Eich interacting and reliving a battle they previously had as enemies from both of their perspectives, then a perspective that actually shows what happened.  We think this will provide a humorous first look at these two characters and how differently they both see the same event from their past.  We can't divulge where this takes place in the chronology of the Good Versus Evil universe just yet, but we feel it the optimal place to introduce everyone to these characters.\nEarly concept for Hal\nHaldor (Or Hal as he is often known) is an elven assassin that fought for the forces of good his entire life.  Becoming increasingly disillusioned by the elders he serves, Hal has to make the choice to venture out on his own with his apprentice, Sid.  Little did Hal know, a great journey was ahead, that would take him to a completely different universe.\nEarly concept art for Eich.\nEichmann Reinhardt is a demonic lord who has prided himself on being the most successful soul taker in his realm.  Despite this, he was unsuccessful in his multiple attempts to kill his nemesis Hal.  Now, forced to join with him in order to fight a greater threat, Eich is forced to put his skills to use in a different capacity.\nWe've picked a phenominal artist (Jeff Tompkins) to bring life to our universe.  Jeff has done work featured in Marvel, DC, Image, and other comics.\nEarly concept art for Hal.\nWe have chosen Jeff as our artist due to the fact that neither of us can draw. \n Seriously, look at Nate's version of Wolverine...\nNate's version of Wolverine...not going to be in the comic.\nWe've worked extensively with Jeff and look forward to continuing to work with him to develop a cohesive understanding of the universe we're trying to create. He's been with us since the beginning and we know that he can provide us exactly with the look and feel that we're going for in bringing Eich and Hal to life. \n While most comic creators are giving out .pdf copies of their comics, we believe that our book is best enjoyed in a tangible physical form.  We have tried to set price points as low as possible in order to give the greatest accessibility possible.  Because of this, we will need a lot of backers, so make sure you share our Kickstarter with your friends!\nWe have a wide variety of rewards, from copies of the comic, to having your likeness in the comic, to being on our Twitch stream live in our studio!  There's something for everyone!\nOne promise that we will make everyone is that we will never make a straight up identical reprint of the items that we will be offering in this Kickstarter.  While we may be doing reprints in the future, they will be modified from the original so those who support us in this Kickstarter will continue to have the original.\nWe also have stretch goals planned should we see success above and beyond our funding goal.  The first major goal will be including color in our comic interior instead of having just black and white pages.  Other goals include the potential for more mini-comics, a launch party, and possibly a short video game based on the comic.  More details will be released once the campaign is underway.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur main obstacle is that we as creators both have full time jobs. That said, we have our outline put together for story flow and our characters developed, we just need to fill in the details. We will take some vacation if need be to flesh out the story in a timely manner. This is also the main reason for the relatively long lead time.\nWe also realize that we are relying on a third party to draw our comic in Jeff, but he has been reliable for all commissions we have used him for in the past through our research. We have committed to giving him plenty of time to work through the project and are looking forward to working closely with him through the development process.\nSuppliers can also always be an issue when it comes to making a product, especially when you are dealing with multiple sources. This is why we've undertaken hours of research to determine who our suppliers will be...not only from a quality standpoint but also a reliability standpoint.\nIf setbacks beyond these arise, we will handle them as any good engineer would: we'll step back, assess the situation, and make the choice that provides our backers with the best possible solution.

There are a lot of people right now that are under the impression that all police officers are bad guys; well it's time to lay down some cold hard truth, some are. But with that being said there are also bad doctors, bad lawyers, bad firefighters, bad soldiers, and bad people. A police officer is a human being underneath their uniform, they bleed, they cry, and yes, they can be killed. Never in our society have we seen so much hate and so much death brought upon our police officers, there are many officers that are paying the ultimate sacrifice that may only be caused by the mistakes of a few. Our police officers are fathers, mothers, brothers, sons, and daughters, they have families just like you and I. Not only do they want to be able to go home to their families when they take that uniform off but they go above and beyond the call of duty by putting that uniform on, they want you to be able to go home to your family.\nSo let me explain to you what this project is going to do. I am a professional photographer and someone who believes that our police need to have a bright light cast upon them, people need to see that our police officers are just normal human beings too. When you watch the news you see one of two things, what a cop did wrong or what cop was just shot and killed. Let me ask you this, why do we never see what cops do good and why do we always address them as just a cop and not just another human being? Well I want that to change! So with your help we can try our best to make that happen.\nThe current amount of funding at my disposal will let me cover the very north eastern part of Ohio, but I do not want to stop there. I want to go as far as I can with this project to highlight officers in their department has human beings with beautiful professional portrait photography, capturing their emotion in uniform. With your help I can reach out to more police departments and I can further provide even more amazing quality photos.\nYour pledge to this project is about more than just helping pay for travel and equipment, but it will be a pledge to Back The Badge that every officer puts on everyday when they go to work.\nThe more money that we make together the more of a difference we can make! We can show that police officers aren't the bad guys, we can show our respect to our fallen officers, we can show the pride that we have to stand behind these brave men and women who put their lives on the line everyday!\nFeel free to stay up to date on this project at BackTheBadgePhotography YouTube Page!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUU0gverl6BwlDbXrs_sQeg\nFor any questions or information I can be reached at (440) 228-5578 or my email address BackTheBadgePhotography@gmail.com\nto have items shipped please email me with your contact information and shipping address completion time for this event may take upwards of 3 months.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProject delays may happen due to either a technical or equipment issue but it is not a show stopper the job will be done by only the best.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jordan Wiser\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nProfessional photographer and creator of the Back The Badge Project to highlight and support law enforcement.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "OCTOBER 17, 2015"}, {"Project launches": "SEPTEMBER 17, 2015"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jordanwiser/back-the-badge", "project_name": "Back The Badge"}}, {"backer": "Greg Thirtyacre III", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "You play a Detective, named Ben Sharp, who is working undercover to find a serial killer that killed your partner while he was working in SURFACE.\nSURFACE or Source Flash Bainite Corporate is a company located in the center of the city, and SURFACE is growing so large, they began to take over the city. SURFACE is where a lot of the game-play takes place. You will get to know the office, where your character will be undercover the slums (where the convicts/workers live) and much more. The city is filled with many different atmospheres to give you a sense of each areas and the struggles/corruption that in tow.\nThis game will consist of finding key suspects, interrogating them and finding who killed your partner. Seems easy, but it's not. There will be times when you will be hunted, or even outright attacked! As Ben Sharp, your job is to be by the books, but within the confines of Surface City corruption might be necessary to get what you need.  \nAside from the struggles of finding the killer, your character has a family of his own that you have to factor in. Financial struggles, events and adversity will force you to make tough decisions. We want you to balance many factors in this game. This allows us to dive deeper to deliver a stronger narrative.\n'Quicktime Events' are a game-play style that we wanted to be sure to add into our game. It has worked well with many great titles, and we want to implement this feature so you face consequences in your event. Let's say you get into a fight with a perp, if you're not fast enough you don\u2019t fail you simply suffer with the consequence. We want the game to be a different experience for everyone who plays.\n'Player Choices' have been around for a long time, but other games tend to use the phrase loosely. We wanted to make SURFACE a game where choices could significantly change everything. Choices that might seem subtle could alter your game entirely. We don\u2019t want to hold your hand while you play, we want this game to make your choices be more relevant.\nMuch like player choices, clues can significantly change the case and alter it entirely. Missing a clue could cause you to go down a road and ultimately cause death, or many other situations. Use clues during a questioning to get more info out of someone. This is something that a true detective game needs to give you a sense of purpose to scrounge around.\nSometimes examining a clue closer will unlock more leads to other people. The detectives office will allow you to look at clues that you have gathered and allow you to review people that you\u2019ve talked to .\nThe killer is cunning, smart, and can be anyone so make sure you look closely at every person because they could be closer than you think.\nWhat started off as a graphic novel two years ago has changed directions into a full game. Inspired by games like \"The Wolf Among Us\" we set out to make a game that takes ideas from successful detective games as well as implement ideas we would like to see in the genre. We have the script all finished and we couldn\u2019t be happier with the story. Now all we need is the funds to turn it into an amazing game.\nWe will be filming a documentary on the journey to making the game all the ups and downs throughout. We have already began filming the process and will continue until after the release.\n\nHere is the breakdown of what the funds are going towards\u2026\nAfter the day is done we will begin streaming live from our studio. We will host numerous game ideas that you the fans come up with. We want to interact with you as much as possible and with the magic of Twitch we can make that a reality!\n The Heads of the Studio\nWe are not going to lie to you, this project will take us roughly 15 months to complete.

Click here to visit our online store and buy merch after we ship our rewards to backers!\nOur Story\nThe Mk.II - a 12,000-pound, 15-foot-tall combat robot that needs upgrades for hand-to-hand combat.\nWe are MegaBots, Inc. We challenged Japan to a giant robot duel, and they accepted... but demanded that the fight include hand-to-hand combat. We say BRING IT ON. We've assembled an incredible team of patriots to help us upgrade the Mk.II into the robot America deserves in the world's first giant robot fight, but we need your support to help pay for those upgrades!\nThe upgraded Mk.II concept - the most American robot ever made.\nRight now, the existing Mk.II tops out at 2.5 mph and is built for long-range paintball combat. That means it has thin, destructible armor plates and a mesh canopy. The entire robot's built to be 'lightweight' (if you can call 12,000 pounds light), and hand-to-hand fighting is a whole new level of combat.\nIn order for the Mk.II to survive hand-to-hand combat, we need to\nAdd heavy duty armor plating\nAdd some serious firepower \nUpgrade our hydraulics to handle the heavier armor and firepower \nIncrease our top speed \nUpgrade our power unit to keep up with our new hydraulic system and speed \nThat basic upgrade will cost $500,000. In order to make sure we win the fight, we need to:\nTest a wide range of weapons and choose the best load-out\nKeep our balance during hand to hand combat and not fall over\nNot injure ourselves in the cockpit during combat\nFight with an incredibly sweet paint job. While not strictly required, this is a matter of national pride. \nAll told, a fully upgraded Mk.II will cost $1,500,000. \nTeam USA needs your help now, in order to win this fight. Pledge today to make sure your team takes home the trophy!\nRobot Upgrades\n$500,000: Melee Combat Capability, High Performance Track Base\nMeeting our $500,000 goal means that we get to seriously overhaul the Mk.II. We'll build the ridiculously cool weapon systems you see in our concept art, add the shock-mounted steel armor we need to survive multi-ton punches, beef up our hydraulic actuators to handle the additional weight of our armor and weapons, upgrade our power unit to provide 5x the horsepower to handle the additional power demands of our new hydraulic system, and then work with Howe & Howe Technologies to build a custom track base replacement that'll make us 5x faster than we are now - which will end up making us 2x faster than KURATAS!\n$750,000: Modular Melee & Ranged Weapon Options\nRaising $750,000 will allow us to design and build an array of melee and ranged weapon systems options to help us find the perfect load-out to beat KURATAS. This kind of fight has never happened in real life before - what works at this scale, and what doesn't? This level will help us answer that question. This assortment potentially includes, but isn't limited to, crushing and grasping claws, pile drivers, shields, pneumatically-driven fists, cannons of all shapes and sizes, and flamethrowers (just in case).\n$1,000,000: Dynamic Balancing Algorithm\nAt the end of the day, both the Mk.II and KURATAS are top-heavy. We can practice driving and punching carefully to make sure we don't fall, but right now both robots run the risk of tipping over if they punch or get punched too hard. Raising $1,000,000 will allow us to work with IHMC Robotics, the top-placed U.S. team in the DARPA Humanoid Robotics Challenge, to develop a custom high-end balance control system for the Mk.II so that we can stay upright no matter what happens. This system could EASILY make the difference between falling over after the first punch, and staying upright through the entire match.\n$1,250,000: Life Safety Systems\nRaising $1,250,000 will allow us to engage with NASA - the leaders in the field of keeping humans safe in extreme environments - to see how NASA life safety systems might be used in the cockpit of the Mk.II. We need make sure we can fight as aggressively as possible while also not blacking out from impacts. Safety 4th, folks.\n$1,500,000: Hollywood-Grade Paint Job\nRaising $1,500,000 will allow us to work with FonCo Creative Services to create a Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel to the robot's armor panels. This is America's first giant combat robot - it deserves to look like the million bucks it actually costs!\nWhat You Get  \n$5: Website Shout-out\nFirst and foremost, you get to tell all your friends that you did your patriotic duty to make sure that America snatches the title of World's Best Giant Robot Builders from the hands of the Japanese. How's that for a reward? For $5 we'll put your name on our website as an online memorial to your awesomeness.\n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Media Content and Sticker\n For $10, we'll set you up with a sweet MegaBots logo sticker to feed your vandalism habit, in addition to the shout-out. All backers contributing to this level or more will also get access to the behind the scenes build process via the documentary we're filming!\n$12/15: Pilot the Mk.II In Robocraft\nFor $12 and above, you'll get to own and pilot the Mk.II in Robocraft, a new free-to-play game by Freejam Games that allows you to build your own combat robots from scratch and take them out onto the field of battle! The $12 level is a digital-only level, and comes with your name on our website but doesn't come with a sticker. The $15 level comes with both the Mk.II in Robocraft and a sticker from the $10 level. Any levels above $12 automatically receive the Robocraft unlock code.\n$25: Most Patriotic Poster Ever Created\nThe Mk.II concept art poster\nFor $25 you'll also get a 18\" x 24\" concept art poster celebrating the creation of the most American robot ever made.\n$50: One MegaBots Shirt\nJoin Team USA and show off your home team pride with a crew shirt!\nOur Evolution of Man shirt\nOur SUPER AMERICAN shirt\nFor $50, you'll get to pick from one of three shirts - a crew shirt that shows off your home team pride, an Evolution of Man shirt that celebrates the escalation of combat over the millennia, or our SUPER AMERICAN shirt that confirms that yes, Kogoro Kurata, building something huge and sticking guns on it is, in fact, Super American.\nYou'll choose which shirt and what sizes you want after the campaign's over, in a survey we send to our backers. If you want more than one shirt, feel free to add $35 to any level above $50, per additional shirt!\n$150: 3D Printed MK. II\nUltimate Swag Kit! Including 3D Printed MegaBot\nAt $150, you'll get the collector's edition swag kit - the shout-out, sticker, poster, and shirt, plus a team picture in front of the robot and a 3D printed MegaBot miniature! \n$500: Ultimate Swag Experience\nIf you want the ultimate swag experience, $500 will get you everything in the collector's edition kit, except it'll be boxed and signed by Grant Imahara, the co-founders of BattleBots, the owners of Howe & Howe Technologies, and the MegaBots team! The boxed kit will be a numbered collector's item, so get yours sooner rather than later!\n$250: Demo Day Experience\nCome see the robot and party with us!\nSwag is awesome - but seeing the robot in person is cooler. For $250, you can come to our demo day, see the robot show off its abilities in person, and throw down at a crazy San Francisco party with the founders of MegaBots.\n$750: VIP Demo Day\nYou, too, can hang out with the MegaBros 1-on-1!\n $750 gets you a VIP demo day experience where you ALSO get to sign the robot, take pictures of yourself inside it, and hang out with the robot and founders in a separate, exclusive event.\n$1000/$2,500/$5,000:  MegaBot Pilot/Weapons Testing\nSuit up and pilot the Mk.II!\nFinally, for the ultimate thrill seekers out there, you can suit up and pilot this beast of a robot. $1,000 gets you a ride in the robot as it drives through an obstacle course at top speed. If just riding in the robot isn't enough, $2,500 puts you in the gunner's seat on our shooting range - blow up mock-up KURATAS robots as we drive the robot through a combat simulation. And if that's not enough... $5,000 will put you in the gunner's seat in an exoskeleton that controls the arms and torso of the Mk.II. You get to use a car as a punching bag until the timer's up. On top of all of these experiences, you get the collector's edition swag and a VIP invitation to our demo day.\nYou must be 18 years of age or older by May of 2016 in order to suit up and pilot the robot, and rest assured that you'll have to sign a mile-long waiver that's full of 'YOU MIGHT DIE. NO, SERIOUSLY.'\n$10,000: Pit Crew Experience\nJoin the pit crew!\nLast, but certainly not least, up to 5 lucky people will get to join our pit crew for $10,000. Come along for the ride on the ultimate, once-in-a-lifetime, behind-the-scenes experience as we take this fight to Japan.\nAdvisers\nGrant Imahara, formerly of Mythbusters and Industrial Light & Magic, has joined forces with us to help us design our robot, bring the giant robot duel to the people, and help make giant robot combat a sport in any way he can!\nPeter Diamandis, founder of the X-Prize, is helping us figure out how we can push the state of the art in robotics by using our competition to drive innovation!\nTrey Roski and Greg Munson, founders of BattleBots, have joined up with us to help us figure out the best weapons and strategies for melee combat against KURATAS, and to help us figure out how we can turn this duel into a sport!\nSponsors\nAutodesk has sponsored us from the beginning, supported the creation of the Mk.II, and will be continuing to support us with design software and access to high-end manufacturing equipment throughout this challenge.

As a small start-up company with a truck, an office and a dream you are throwing your hat into the ring to challenge the big boys.\nThe freight has to be moved and there is stiff competition for who can get loads first and who can make the most profitable routes.

It is important to dominate a region or two with the most deliveries while not ignoring the other regions.\nPLAY\n\nIn the end, your deliveries will be compared to the other players to determine which company has the best overall presence in the US. Players gain presence by moving their trucks from city to city across the United States picking up and dropping off deliveries along the way. You can specialize in high profit cross-country runs or you can make numerous short routes.\nThe rules are available here.\nOn each turn the vagaries of the business will be determined by a deck of event cards.

In addition to this gem, Joe has worked on Manoeuvre: Distant Lands being published by GMT Games and Dark Domains which NNG is excited to do later this year.\nDEVELOPER:Loaded Up and Truckin' has been developed by Jeff Horger, designer of Manoeuvre, 20th Century Limited, Thunder Alley & the upcoming Fast & Furious: Full Throttle among others. Jeff has made a switch from design to development and is eager to use his 15 years of experience to help other designers bring their games to fruition.\nART DIRECTION: The game art and design has been done by James Davis who also did Jeff & Carla's 20th Century Limited with Rio Grande. What you see here on the Kickstarter page is some of the finished work for the game. As more art becomes available, we will share that during the campaign and subsequent updates.\n\u201cLoaded up & Truckin\u2019 has a really solid presentation. One of the best things about it is the giant map. I love how nice the board looks when you start moving freight.\u201d-Steve Oksienik (Cardboard Insanity)\nWhat makes an NNG game Special?\nWhen you're trying to decide whether or not you to back a game on Kickstarter, one of the most important considerations you make is getting a sense of whether or not the game is any good. An important thing to look for is whether or not a professional developer is attached to the project.\n\u2022 All of our games receive professional development\nProfessional development means that someone with experience in the hobby and game design comes at the design objectively to review the mechanisms and gameplay. A designer who has invested months iterating details and hours of playtests can easily lose some perspective along the way. Developers are only focused on where the game is when they come to it, so they have fresh eyes.\nA developer is like an editor to a manuscript. This role is essential because they look for untested assumptions, ferret out where things can be streamlined, and engage the designer in a fresh dialog about where the game is and can still go. Have playtesters been ruthless? Can the game be shorter? Is there a dominant strategy? A developer is a professional game's best friend.\nTHE PLAN\n Nothing Now Games is a start-up company hoping to take full use of the Kickstarter marketplace. We have a variety of great games waiting to be produced, and what we need is commitments from people like you to help these games see the light of day. If any of us in the company had the ability to do so, we would produce all of these games right away. However, in the final assessment, we need your help to make not only Loaded Up & Truckin' a reality, but Nothing Now Games as well. This is not unfortunate, it allows us to put a great game out there and see if we can get people to help us make it as spectacular as possible. We at NNG are excited to have this chance to start out on the right foot and begin building a base of fans and partners from the start.\nWhat do we need the money for and in specific, what do we need this exact amount of money for?\nWe need to pay the printers. \nWe need to pay for Shipping from the factory to our warehouse. \n We need to pay the artist for the work that is already completed including the box cover, game board and event card deck. \nWe need to pay the artist to finish the parts that have not yet been completed including the token sheet, player mats, box back & rule book. \nPay Kickstarter. \nA small cushion against unexpected expenses.\nWhat if we go over the goal? Well, the first inclination is to say, great! a profit. But the truth is we would like to have some extra cushion for the unexpected costs that will arise. Any actual profits will be cycled back into NNG for future games. Currently we have about 15 games on the boards waiting to get into your hands. Some of them are wonderful Kickstarter games, Dark Domains, Fury of Harrows, Title Chase Basketball. Others however are games that don't fall neatly into the Kickstarter category, like Card Games and Kids Games. So all of us that make up the company are essentially working for free through the first 4-6 games as the company to builds up the reserves that will allow us to make a mistake or publish some games outside of the Kickstarter model. So if we really do well, NNG will progress more quickly than expected and the four of us that make up the company will have pride in a job well-done.\nWhy should you fund this Kickstarter? After all, if it succeeds this game will possibly be on store shelves anyway, so why help out now? The most obvious answer is that without your Kickstarter patronage there will be no game and no company. No one associated with the company has the cash reserves laying around to make it happen without you. We will swim or sink due to your support. If the game does succeed we acknowledge that the people that helped us succeed should get something unique as a thank you for their support. To us that means that any game we put on Kickstarter will be unique from future editions.\n Nothing Now Games has given this concept a great deal of thought. Unlike some Kickstarter Publishers we are hoping to become a large publisher. So out of the gate we have numerous games to develop, create and sell. Physically and economically it seems counter-productive to have knick-knacks that do not improve the game to be placed in specific shipments. Instead we have decided that for all games we put on Kickstarter we will have a \"Kickstarter Edition\". That first printing of the game will have something as a part of it that is unique. If the game warrants a reprint, the Kickstarter special components will be swapped out, forever. Anyone that ends up buying a 1st Edition (Kickstarter Edition) will have a unique version of the game. Some of you wordsmiths may have already deduced this, but it does mean that, whatever amount of the first print run is not sold via Kickstarter will also hit the market with those unique bits. We are not trying to mislead anyone, but from a business standpoint, it is easier to make a smaller run that may overflow some into the distribution marketplace than to be forced to add in components post production to specific games. Other clever ones of you may also now think that all editions subsequent to the first will be somewhat unique as well. That is also the case, but we are making every effort to have the big guns show up in the Kickstarter edition.\nLOADED UP & TRUCKIN' KICKSTARTER EDITION\nSo what is special about the Loaded Up & Truckin' version that you can get through Kickstarter? I'm glad you asked. Our philosophy is to include everything necessary for the game in the base game. If you need it, you get it; whatever \"it\" is. If you don't need it, then we are not going to spend a lot of effort creating chachkies that don't enhance game play. That does pose interesting choices for what to put into the Kickstarter Edition. Luckily we have a large number of Event Cards that could have been included in the games. So the Kickstarter Edition will have 41 Event Cards and if the game ever warrants a reprint we will swap out at least 10 of those cards and likely more for different events that were not chosen for the first game.\nBACKER LEVELS\nOur Backer Levels are pretty simple.  \nAt $40 we are providing you a copy of the Kickstarter Edition of the Game.  \nFor an extra $20 you can name one commodity in the game. City assignment is on a first-come basis.  \nFor an extra $50 you will be allowed to name one of the 36 truck drivers in the game. Color/Company assignment will be on a first-come basis.  \nFor an extra $100 you will be allowed to name one of the 6 Trucking Companies in the game. Colors will be assigned on a first come-basis.  \nAt $500 you get 2 games and you get to meet the crew and have dinner on us at one of the 2016 conventions we are sure to be at; Origins, Gencon or Buckeye Game Fest.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nFor this campaign we will have two very achievable stretch goals. \nAt $42,000 we will replace the standard six-sided die in the game with a custom die and remove the chart from the game board.\nAt $45,000 we will include wooden trucks and a sticker sheet for identification.\nThat is all that the game really can use without getting bloated. This game is very complete as is and the couple of improvements essentially fill it out. There is not really anything else useful to be added. We also feel that as this is our first product, we should try to stick to a solid plan and not get in any trouble chasing rabbits down every hole. We can handle producing the game and we chose Loaded Up & Trucking specifically because it does not lend itself to numerous enhancements. But that is not true for all of our games. We will have some games coming in the future that may end up being a Stretch Goal monsters (Dark Domains anyone?) so we are not put off by them, it is just that this game simply needs nothing else to be the best game it can be.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo let's say we get this truck loaded up, what might happen between the warehouse and the destination?\n\nArt. We will have the cover, board and cards done for the game before the Kickstarter launches. But there are some player aids and a mountain of tokens that need to be done. Hopefully that will not take too long, but it will involve some time for the artist who is very good and very busy.\n\nAfter that, it is in the printers hands and the shippers trucks and boats. We at NNG have no control over the games from their leaving the loading docks at the printers until they reach our destination point. Hopefully you are all savvy enough to understand this. But that can be a major source of delay.\n\nNNG is happy that we not only have game industry professionals on the team but our boss is a very skilled project manager who is used to dealing with and overcoming problems and has 15 years of experience managing projects from inception through completion and warranty. He has previous experience with a distribution company in the top 20 of the fortune 500 as well as a leading auto financial services institute. I feel quite safe that among us we can overcome any issue. But don't rely on just us, our list of contacts and mentors is long and varied. If we run into any serious issue we have many other industry professionals willing to give us help and advice.\n\nWe at NNG intend to be completely transparent about our projects and our company. If we could, we would make all of our supporters partners. Yes, we are doing this for potential profit. But we hope to create games and a company with loyal fans and happy customers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Nothing Now Games, LLC.\n2 created \u00b7 1 backed\nWhile Nothing Now Games is a brand new company, the people behind it are most assuredly not.

She truly became something very incredibly special in my life.\nSo it\u2019s come to the point where I want to make her my wife and ask for her hand in marriage.\nNow because I am a videographer and a creative fella in general, I wanted to propose to her in a way that would truly stand out and really have fun with it.\nThe Plan:\nMy idea is that I would make an epic movie trailer that would play at our local theater (That I plan on renting out) as we wait for the movie to start.\nIn the trailer I will strategically place each friend and family member that would be in the wedding. They will be playing parody roles of iconic films. I would then play the character of myself drifting through each film, breaking the 4th dimension, and pulling family and friends from those films to join us for \u201cThe Wedding\u201d. The video would be shot in the fun style that most movie trailers are made, quick action, funny lines, and of course an epic slow-motion Dancing Scene at the end if she says yes.\nIt\u2019s gonna be a really fun project, the script is already written with parody roles of films such as \u201cLife of Pi\u201d \u201cGhostbusters\u201d \u201cKill Bill\u201d \u201cAnchorman\u201d and \u201cMoonrise Kingdom\u201d\nWith my talented crew \u201cChaos in Rhythm\u201d that will be assisting me in making this film, I don\u2019t see why this wont easily become a reality.\nThe Action:\nI will be renting out a local theater, one of our favorite places to go. Keely will just be thinking we are going out to see a movie. We will sit down, I will then make an excuse to get up and leave my seat for a moment. And that\u2019s when the trailer will start playing. I will have cameras in the theater to capture her reaction as \u201cThe Conlan Proposal\u201d is playing. Once the trailer is over the lights will come up, I will walk in and propose to her. Upon her saying yes, (I hope haha) all that assisted in helping me make the film will then flood into the theater, where we will have drinks, snacks, and then maybe actually watch the film we came to see to begin with.\nProposal T\nTshirt that will come with donations", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI suppose some of the risks would involve me running out of funds. Film making is very labor intensive, as well as financially intensive. There are always surprise expenses that you don\u2019t expect to run into. I guess a risk might be that I\u2019m wildly underestimating the amount this project may cost. (This is even more of a reason that I will need help with funding).\n\nAnother risk I see developing is that this project will involve outside forces. Maybe the film center will turn down my attempt to use a theater for this proposal, maybe not everyone wants to be filmed, and maybe Keely will say no!!!!!...\n\nHowever I\u2019m not nervous about any of that, there are many places/theaters that I can pitch my idea to. A majority of my friends and family are outgoing enough that I don\u2019t see any of them saying no. And as for Keely saying yes, well, that\u2019s the risk anyone runs into when proposing. My mission it to make it hard for her to say anything but yes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Sorry for the delay", "update_content": "its been a process for sure in the editing room, but we are on the last chapters of correction for the audio, all that's left is calling the venue and setting a date!\nI'm also looking into providing the gifts today for all of you that provided to the film.

The object of the game is to race other \"Santas\" throughout the world, stopping at highly populated cities along the way to deliver gifts. The first player to arrive back at the North Pole wins the game. But, watch out! Your journey along the Candy Cane Path will be filled with a few twists and turns.\nThis fun, fast-paced and educational game will provide a great way for your family to come together at the holidays or any time of year. \nMy wife and I always look forward to spending quality time with our two young kids at the holidays. A seasonal tabletop game seemed like a perfect activity for the family - but we couldn't find one anywhere! So we created our own - Santa's Sleigh Ride.\nFamily Play Test\nOur goal was to create a simple and intuitive holiday game that all ages would enjoy. Through dozens of play tests we have developed a simple concept, easy to understand rules, and just enough variation that the gameplay is different every time!\nWe also wanted to build in technical accuracy (because we can't resist a good spreadsheet!). For example, we created a population index (~4,000,000:1) to determine the gifts needed per city (or combination of cities). We use a realistic map that features many well-known cities and popular landmarks. We even created a simple equation to determine the proper value and amount of 'gift cards' needed for 15-30 minutes of gameplay based on average turn length.\n46 Gift Cards\n17 Action Cards\n 6 Player Pawns\n1 Game Board\n1 Six-sided Die\n1 Instruction Manual\nI am a teacher. I have experience instructing kids of all ages, ranging from kindergarten to college. It was important to me to include educational elements in the game (that do not feel like homework!). Your child can practice early math skills in a fun, engaging way. And, the whole family can talk about the cities of the world, how many people live there, and popular landmarks.\nAll players start at the North Pole.\nDraw one card at the start of each turn. You will either draw a Gift Card or an Action Card (see above card description):\n- Hold Gift Cards until you can deliver them.\n- Use Action Cards immediately.\nAt the North Pole: when you draw a \"1\" you deliver (discard) the \"first gift of the holidays\" and roll the die. Move forward that number of cities.\nWhen you land on a city:\n- If you are already holding the correct number of gifts for that city you may discard those gifts, roll the die, and move forward. You may continue to deliver gifts and roll until you are out of required Gift Cards.\n- If you do not already have the correct number of gifts, stay at that city. Continue drawing one card on each turn until you can discard the required number of gifts for that city. Then roll the die and move forward.\nYou must deliver the exact amount of gifts needed for each city that you land on.\nFirst player to return to the North Pole wins!\nCheck out the video below for some short excerpts of gameplay footage:\nPLAY\n\nWe have only 1 stretch goal.

Buying merchandise in order to support a charitable organizations puts you into the got-something-in-return category. The price you pay for the records, t-shirts, rainsticks, etc...cannot be fully deducted; only the difference between your purchase price and fair market value qualifies. For example, someone with discerning taste is going to buy Keating's rainstick for $750 and probably hang it in their formal dining room. The fair market value of a rainstick is about $30; therefore, the amount this individual can deduct is $720. You can use Amazon or Ebay to check the fair market value of any item on our rewards list.

You might need a drink with this one.\nWe are three friends, Bill, Mike and Tomos who share a passion for great food. We spent most of our lives working in fine dining restaurants and saw firsthand how food can bring people together. \nThat's us! Bill, Mike and Tomos!\nThe food was great, but something felt missing. These higher-end restaurants have too much formality. Everything seems too uptight and it's not a place where you can be yourself.  \nOur idea:\nTake the cooking techniques used in fine dining. \nApply it to a simple dish everyone can love. \nServe it in a comfortable and inviting atmosphere.   \nDaredevil Dogs needs to be a place where you can feel comfortable being yourself. So the dish we serve needs to match that personality! It has to be friendly and down to earth, just like you!\nOur answer?\nThe seemingly simple and approachable hot dog!  \nAn American classic, we wanted to make sure we use the best ingredients and give it our very own Ohio twist!\nYour standard hot dog is shrouded in mystery. Nobody can tell what\u2019s inside! \nFor us, only the highest-quality ingredients make it to your hot dog.\nEverything we use is sourced locally. This not only makes our food taste fresher and better, but it helps support local businesses as well! That means using Ohio fresh meats, and baked buns delivered from local Ohio bakeries! We make all our delicious sauces and toppings from scratch using ingredients purchased at the local supermarkets.\nWe want to bring our food to as many people as possible, in all communities across Central Ohio \u2013we\u2019ve contacted other food trucks, bars, festival organizers and office buildings to finalize our space. It\u2019s important that we are active and involved with the community.\nIf you have an office building, high school football game, birthday or work party you want DareDevil Dogs to take part in, tell us and we\u2019ll do our best to be there!\nReach out on Twitter, Facebook or by email so we can bring our daring dogs to you! \nGood news! We\u2019ve found our dream truck! Your money helps us outfit, modify and class up the truck, making sure it reaches the Daredevil Dogs quality of standard. That means upgraded kitchen equipment, set up costs, insurance fees and plenty of other expenses that come with starting a mobile restaurant.\nThe layout for our food truck.\nOur limited edition Kickstarter t-shirt. Printed locally by the awesome people over at Traxler Custom Printing.\n Stretch Goal\n$12,000- Thank You! We want to make our good truck look great and support the local community. If we can reach our stretch goal we will work with local artist Andrew Kern to hand paint our truck. The truck will be a great representation of DareDevil Dogs and the local art community.

We think so, and that's why we're developing new solar technology to unlock the potential of underused spaces below our city's streets.\nWith this cutting-edge technology, we plan to build the world's very first underground \"park,\" featuring live plants and trees!\nIt turns out there's a 107-year-old former trolley station-- untouched since 1948-- right below Delancey Street in the center of New York City's Lower East Side neighborhood. All the old architectural details are still there, and right now it sits in one of the most crowded neighborhoods in a very crowded city. Our dream is to take that space back and transform it into a beautiful public gathering space.\nTo make the Lowline a reality, our next step is the construction of an ambitious Lowline Lab-- a long-term solar device testing laboratory and public exhibition to test and display our tech and design vision-- and we need your help to build it!\nThe Lowline is about the future-- but it's also about celebrating history.  Here's a 1930s photo of the site we want to re-invigorate-- formerly the Williamsburg Bridge Trolley Terminal. It was originally used to carry passengers over the newly built Williamsburg Bridge between 1908 and 1948.\nThe original trolley terminal during trolley service in the 1930s.\nIt's a one-acre site with all of its old historic details-- you can see remnant cobblestones and rail lines dating back to 1908, as well as catenary tracks on the ceiling.\nThe abandoned site in 2013.\nNow just a forgotten slice of New York City history, we want to preserve this little gem and use it in a totally new, 21st-century, kick-ass kind of way. Our design team has developed early images of what the future Lowline could look like- an extraordinary oasis underneath one of New York City's most crowded neighborhoods.\nRendering of the Lowline, courtesy of Raad Studio.\nGlad you asked!\nNeeded green space: New York City has much less green space per person than other big cities, and the Lower East Side is one of the least green neighborhoods within the city. The Lowline will add a new football-field-sized public space in a community that desperately needs it. Plus it will be awesome for generations of New Yorkers and visitors to enjoy. \nLove of history: This site is the oldest existing relic of the city's former streetcar past, and features cobblestones laid down by hand by immigrants between 1904-1908. While others might want it to become a boring retail basement or a parking lot, we will preserve the old architectural details while adding in new plants, trees, and futuristic technology. \nInspiring technology: We need to be more creative about how we use space in the 21st century, and we think our tech approach helps solve a big problem: making the vastly underutilized underground beautiful, for both plants and humans. \nWe plan to collect sunlight on the rooftops surrounding the Lowline, before using extremely efficient mirrors to reflect that light down to the street level, and direct it underground via tubes.  With this technology, we can direct so much natural light underground that we'll be able to plant many different kinds of plant species, almost like a botanical garden right in the middle of the city.\nIn order for the City to officially approve the project, we still have some big questions to answer. Will the solar tech work?  Will plants really grow?  Will it be a popular public space? To answer these questions, we're planning a long-term testing exhibition called the Lowline Lab, and we need $200,000 to build it. We've rented out a former market building, just a couple blocks from the future Lowline site, and are ready to go.\nHere's what we're planning to do at the Lowline Lab:\nTest solar technology performance: Following the last few years of research, we want to see with our own eyes how our technology functions over time. We'll test how effectively we can re-direct sunlight remotely, by installing three solar collection systems on the roof of an abandoned former warehouse space, and distributing that light into the otherwise dark space. Partnering with the solar device maker SunPortal, we are shipping cutting edge equipment via ocean freighter from South Korea to New York City, and will begin installation over the summer. These devices will track the sun throughout the sky every minute of every day, optimizing the amount of natural sunlight we can capture. These will be connected to a tube-based distribution system and 40-foot-wide canopy inside the warehouse, to help reflect natural sunlight into the Lowline Lab. Once this natural sunlight is filtered into the space, we can test for the quality of the light, taking specific note of spectrum, distribution and intensity. This research will be critical to our understanding of how much light can be gathered and filtered into the actual Lowline.  And since we'll conduct tests for six months, from September 2015- February 2016, we'll see how this technology works in the fall and the winter.\nA photo of our solar canopy from 2012, reflecting natural sunlight indoors.\nTest landscape design and performance: We will test our research on the species of plants our team has determined will thrive best in the lighting conditions of the Lowline. So we are partnering with horticulture experts at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden; the globally recognized Signe Nielsen (also a Lowline Board member), of landscape architecture firm Mathews Nielsen; Terrain; and Dirt Works to build a beautiful interior design featuring plants that prefer differing lighting levels. Our design inspiration is Mannahatta-- a verdant vision of the city before modern civilization-- and we expect to feature edible plants, and a science fiction palette of greenery forming stalactites, stalagmites, and whimsical passageways.  Again, because we are testing in the fall and winter-- the two toughest times to grow plants-- we will gain valuable insight into which species will perform best throughout the year.\nTest the social and community value of the Lowline: We'll measure human happiness factors associated with our \"park,\" across different seasons. The Lab will be open in New York City from September- February, allowing us to see how the space is perceived and used in both the fall, when the weather outside can be variable, and the winter, when the weather outside is generally cold and often nasty. We plan to keep the space open and free to all on weekends, and we intend to survey happiness levels in both quantitative and qualitative ways, before and after visiting a safe, magical, beautiful indoor \"park.\"\nHow popular will the Lowline be in fall and in winter? We want to find out!\nThe Lab will also give us a chance to study the various ways in which the Lowline can be an incredible asset for the local community. We will expand upon our Young Designers Program by opening up the Lab to weekly visits from youth organizations and schools, to truly test how valuable the Lowline could be as a pedagogical vehicle to get kids excited about science and tech. With a series of technology \"Lab Talks,\" we'll see how effective we can be at inspiring community members about the transformative power of innovation. And with \"Lab Walks,\" we will directly connect interested visitors not only to an insider's look at our technology research, but also will visit the nearby Essex Street Market, a historic gem that truly bridges the past, present, and future of the neighborhood surrounding the Lowline.\nIn a sense, the Lowline Lab will be a very exciting, dynamic prototype of the future Lowline-- from the perspectives of solar technology, landscape design, and human interactivity. And unlike many research laboratories, this will be free and open to the public... so YOU can come experience it, and provide your input over six months!\nWe officially launched the Lowline project on Kickstarter in 2012, which helped us get started on multiple fronts. With this funding and the support of additional backers from all walks of life, we focused on building a public exhibit; conducting extensive technology research; building political and local support; and fostering sustained community engagement. Here's a quick update on all we've been up to:\nWe hand-stitched together hundreds of aluminum panels to build the solar canopy for our 2012 exhibition.\n\"Imagining the Lowline\" exhibit: Our very first step was building a technology exhibit with Kickstarter support, where we installed a solar collection system in a warehouse and a live green space, designed mainly to show everyone how the Lowline would look and feel. We opened this exhibit in 2012, and over 11,000 people checked it out in just about two weeks! So we were able to share this vision with the world, test an early version of the technology, and learn about ways the Lowline could be a real popular hub for the community. \nThis is the final exhibition, featuring a live green space with a solar canopy and Lowline technology overhead.\nOver 11,000 visitors came to the exhibit, and hung out!\nTechnology research: We conducted a range of site visits and scientific research to assess our optimal solar technology devices and partners. We also carefully measured the amount of natural sunlight we can deliver on every day of every year given new multi-story towers to be built just above the site. Our team, along with our partners at Arup, determined that we will be able to deliver enough sunlight underground using our proposed methods, and that multiple species of plants can indeed thrive underground!\nWe conducted a comprehensive shadow study of Delancey Street, right above the Lowline site.\nOur board chair, David Barry, checking out our solar technology partner SunPortal's lighting tube, illuminating a dark tunnel like magic!\nBuilding support: We set up a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, and built an insanely awesome group of collaborators, supporters, and advisors-- some amazing people and organizations willing to help invest their time, expertise and resources in the effort (more on these good folks below).  All elected officials who represent our neighborhood-- from the NYC City Council to the U.S. Senate-- now support our effort, and now we're working with the NYC Mayor's office to determine the political path toward achieving site control and official designation as a public space. \nNew York City Council Member Margaret Chin along with other elected officials at a Lowline event at our 2012 exhibit.\nCommunity engagement: Over the last few years, we've found that the Lowline is a great way to get local kids excited about science and technology. So we've built the Young Designers Program, which has now reached hundreds of local kids with creative programming-- and also provided us with some pretty rad ideas.  \nYoung Designers surveying a local public park.\nThe program first shows how science, technology, engineering, arts, and math (STEAM) make the Lowline possible, and then we ask students to think about public space in general, visiting other popular neighborhood parks and gathering spaces to observe what works and what doesn't work from their perspective.\nYoung Designers learning about fiber optics.\nAfter learning about the science and tech behind the project, kids then come up with their own ideas for what they would like to see in a potential park in their neighborhood. Working with teaching artists, students have a chance to both draw their ideas and even to build 3D models of their dream parks-- working both individually and collaboratively in teams.\nA 3D model from our Young Designers Program on display in March 2015\nIn 2014 and again in 2015, we have presented all these student visions at a public exhibition and showcase in a Lower East Side art gallery, giving kids a chance to share their ideas with the world, giving parents a chance to interact with the project, and giving us a ton of useful input on what local kids want to see and experience in the Lowline. \nThe Lowline Lab in 2015- 2016 will give us a fresh chance to build upon and expand the Young Designers Program, by bringing kids into the laboratory to observe real-world science and imagine new programmatic uses of a space they can physically see!\nThe amount of your pledge that is deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes is limited to the excess of the amount of any money and the value of any property contributed by you over the value of the goods or services provided to you by Lowline.

Thirty years ago, The Bard\u2019s Tale put Brian Fargo and Interplay on the map and launched a storied career crafting some of the most beloved cRPGs in gaming history.\nToday, we return to Skara Brae for the long-awaited dungeon-crawling sequel to the Bard\u2019s Tale trilogy -- the games that helped define the genre.\n[French Translation] [German Translation] [Spanish Translation] [Polish Translation] [Russian Translation]\nA single-player, party-based role-playing game, rich in exploration and combat\nDungeons filled not just with dangerous fights but with challenging puzzles and devious riddles\nDynamic phase-based combat, where the pace of battle is animated and fluid, but still gives you time to think and respond to your enemies\nA game set to beautiful Gaelic music, where the Bard\u2019s songs and melodies affect gameplay\nCo-funded by fans and inXile: if this game hits its $1.25 million goal, inXile will put in at least $1.25 million of its own money to double the initial budget!\nBuilt using Unreal Engine 4, for PC, Mac and Linux.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo. Brian was directly involved in the creation of all three The Bard\u2019s Tale games in the 80s, the first game launching his long and storied career at Interplay and inXile through the 90s to now.\ninXile has embraced the crowdfunding model fully, delivering the fan favorite Wasteland 2 (over 70,000 backers raising over $3 million), and following it up with Torment: Tides of Numenera (over 90,000 backers raising almost $4.9 million and still going). We doubled Wasteland 2\u2019s crowdfunded budget with our own funds, and continue to support it with the upcoming Game of the Year Edition, which will be released as a feature rich and extensive free upgrade to all PC backers and buyers.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is spearheaded by the same team that delivered the award-winning Wasteland 2.\nAs always, inXile Entertainment is proud to be a part of Kicking It Forward, pledging to spend 5% of our eventual profits back into crowdfunding projects.\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged at any tier $20+, you can include add-ons with your pledge.

The studio is in its 12th year of existence now, and has a proven track record for Kickstarter-produced games, having released Wasteland 2 to fan and critical acclaim and with a second project in production in Torment: Tides of Numenera.\n\nThe main challenge is indicating a fully accurate delivery date, which is not possible to do before we know how much funding we have. As funding increases, it allows us to increase the scope and depth of the product, but this will inevitably impact the release date.

(glare, crop, etc.)\nEach one of these options also require you to tag and organize your photos later, or it will be hard to find exactly what you are looking for. For many people, neither of these options are ideal, so they pick option 4.  Do nothing.  Today, QromaScan (think 'crow-ma-scan') offers a newer, smarter way to scan and organize your photos.\nWe\u2019ve built the ultimate post-PC photo scanner that captures and tags your photos in one step with the two things you probably use the most everyday; your iPhone and your voice.\nTag Photos with Voice Recognition\nTake 60 seconds and watch a demo of how easy it is to tag your photos with QromaScan's simple voice recognition technology.  Tell us the date, location and people in the photo, and we will tag it with searchable metadata you can take to Lightroom, iPhoto or other photo organization programs.\nOther Key Features\nBookish & Brilliant: Born to be as thin and portable as a book, QromaScan goes wherever your photos are. Use it at home, or slip it in your bag for a trip to grandma's house. In a flash, it transforms into a sturdy photo lightbox where the 12 brilliant LED lights tucked inside are calibrated to make your photos look perfect.\nBlisteringly Fast: Slide in photo; Snap! Slide in photo; Snap! Get the picture? We do too! Our innovative software finds your photo against the chroma-green background and dials in exactly the best settings before it scans and crops it perfectly.\nFlip for It: So much of our family history is written on the back of our photos. QromaScan loves the back of your photos too! Use our innovative Backscan command, and your most important photos are flippable. Literally.\nEureka!: You know that thing you do when you\u2019re are looking for a photo? Scrolling up and down, and down and up? Forget that. QromaScan makes it dead simple to find the photos you\u2019ve just scanned. Type in a few letters of a name or location and there they are, in date order. Better yet, make a Photo Playlists and use a combination of Date, Location or People to create a dynamic album that grows whenever you scan in more matching photos.\nThe QromaScan Lightbox\nHigh Quality Images\nThe cameras inside our iPhones can produce very high quality images, but as anyone that has ever tried to take a picture of a picture can tell you, the results aren\u2019t always perfect. As hard as you try to get your phone at just the right height and angle, there\u2019s always some glare or blurriness that can ruin the shot. Getting it to crop correctly is also nearly impossible.\nThe Lightbox eliminates all of these problems by providing the most ideal environment for photo scanning. For example:\nWith the Lightbox, your phone and the images are in perfect alignment, so the images are cropped correctly.  \nThe distance between the camera lens and the photos is a known fixed point, so our software dials in just the right focal length, eliminating any chance of  blurry scans. \n We also set the perfect exposure and white balance because we know the exact color temperature of the LED lights that illuminate the Lightbox.\nThe QromaScan App\nScan and view your photos with the QromaScan app\nNo Touching\nLots of other apps make you touch the screen to take a scan, crop the image, or save a file. That kills the scanning workflow and slows things way down.\nWe used a totally different approach. From the moment you enter scan mode and place your iPhone on the Lightbox, everything is handled using our voice recognition engine. This frees your hands to slide the photos in and out.\nPhoto Tagging Made Easy\nQromaScan is the world\u2019s first photo scanner that tags your photos using a voice recognition engine. Just tell us the data, location and people that are in your photos, and we will add the metadata tags as you scan. \nSay:\n\"Qroma, The Date is August 1st, 1957 the Place is Honolulu International Airport\"\nFrom this, we create the right date and location tags and write it directly to the file.  If fact, we geotag the image with the precise location of Honolulu International Airport.\nHere's what the tags created by QromaScan looks like when viewed on a computer:\nYou can say an exact address, and we'll geotag the photo with the GPS coordinates. For example, say something like:\n\u201cThe place is 1 Infinite Loop\u201d\nWe'll find the location, and your photo metadata will look like this:\nSearching\nWe wanted to make it simple to find the images you\u2019ve tagged. Nothing is as frustrating as having to scroll up and down when hunting for a photo you want.\nIn the gallery, just type the first few letters of a person or location, and you will see those photos sorted in chronological order.\nFind photos without scrolling!\nBackScan\nA lot of our photos have things written on the back of them. It was metadata in the physical world. Even though QromaScan can translate these facts into photo metadata using voice recognition, there is a lot of value in the handwriting itself. For this reason, we created a special feature called BackScan to preserve these notes.\nWhen scanning one of these photos, just flip it over and say the word \u2018BackScan\u2019. The QromaScan app scans the back of the photos and associates it with the front image that was just scanned. We bind these two images together in the Gallery, and we have a special 'dog-eared' thumbnail for them.\n When looking at the photo in detail view, tapping on the Flip icon reveals the BackScan.\nGEDCOM Import\nQromaScan will allow you to import a standard GEDCOM file into our speech recognition engine so that names from your family tree can be recognized for tagging photos.\nPhoto Editing Built In\nWhy wait until you've moved your scans over to a computer to touch them up? QromaScan has built in the popular Aviary photo editing tools right into the Gallery.  You can crop, rotate and do tons of other photo editing without leaving your iPhone.\nBuilt in photo touch up\nThe QromaScan Story\nIn many ways, the QromaScan story started when I was 28 and lost my father to lung cancer. Though we were not exceptionally close, we both shared a love of traveling to foreign countries. As I went through the stacks of photos he had left behind, it struck me what a mystery some of those images were. I simply didn\u2019t know much about the dates, places or people in many of them. Some of them were important-looking, and one in particular stood out.\nNot knowing who was in this photo turned me into a metadata nerd. It turns out it was my dad greeting William Wyler and his wife at the airport while he was a Regional Manager at PanAm.\n The photos, which at one time were important enough to take, now were at risk of having their stories lost. Once I made this realization, I decided that every photo I had would contain the digital equivalent of a note on the back of the photo documenting the date, location and people in the photo.\nI learned about something called photo metadata, which was a way to tag images very much the same way music is tagged in MP3s. However, this was hard to do correctly. I learned about industry standards, wrote some specialized software, and slavishly tagged every photos I had. Today I have about 40,000 images; each containing the photo metadata that connects the collection together.\nZip forward to today, I looked around and realized that for most of my friends, as far as photos went, they still had a digital life and a paper one. Most of their photos older than 10 years were in boxes, while the rest were on their phones or computers. Photos scanners hadn\u2019t made enough of a breakthrough to compel us to digitize our boxes, and technology hadn\u2019t made it easier to organize photos. The market needed innovation.\nAt the same time speech recognition technology has made a leap forward, and I realized that my geeky process of tagging photos could be made much simpler by the one tool that everyone knows how to use; their voice.\nSuddenly, the idea behind QromaScan was born; an easy to use tool that scans and organizes your box of photos in one step using voice recognition.\nPrototype Development\nIzzy and Lulu run down some our prototypes in this video\nTimeline\nFollow us, please!\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nGoogle+\nAcknowledgments\nWe met a ton of great people on our way to bringing QromaScan to market. Some were brave enough to come on camera, and I'd like thank Shannon, Stacy, McKenna, Sara, Izzy and Lucia for helping us tell our story. Huge thanks to Jared at Acrylonics in San Jose for the plastic wonderland that practically became our R&D lab.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding a next generation scanning solution required overcoming a number of design challenges, both on the hardware and software side.\n\nAlthough at first glance the QromaScan Lightbox looks relatively simple, a lot of iterative testing cycles were required to make sure that the final product met all of our design goals. To reduce manufacturing risk, we cycled through several stages of prototype development. From 3D models to CNC routed ABS prototypes, we continually refined the Lightbox into its final form. Once we felt we had achieved our design standards, we found a manufacturing partner that allowed us a way to make real world production samples. We further refined three production samples until we were satisfied that the QromaScan Lightbox was both functional and durable. We have product in hand now that we know we can manufacture quickly and efficiently.\n\nThere were challenges on the software side as well. We know that scanning photos is something nobody wants to do twice, so getting the software right the first time was important to us.\n\nIn many ways, the QromaScan iOS application is quite cutting edge. We used two different voice recognition platforms together to detect not only dates and locations, but also proper names in your contact list. We spent over a year developing, testing and iterating the software to ensure that the thing that makes QromaScan shines so brightly comes through in the finished product.\n\nLooking back, we think going slow and iterating helped us mitigate some of the most important risks involved in bringing a cutting edge, new product to market.\n\nLooking forward, we are planning for success to help us lower unforeseen risks. We lined up 3 excellent suppliers, and we have communicated our timeline to them. We feel confident that we can deliver both our hardware and software to our backers by the time we have planned.

The first is congestion at West Coast ports.  There was a longshore strike earlier this year that was settled at the end of May, but a backlog exists today, and there is a possibility that it could take up to an additional 7 days to get our goods into our bonded warehouse.  The other potential gotcha is if our container gets picked to be screened by customs.

Now four short years later and over 5,000 sensors sold, we're extremely proud to announce our new 4th generation muscle sensor, the MyoWare. \nWe released our 3rd generation sensor, Muscle Sensor v3, in 2013, to an amazing reception; we sold over 3,500 Muscle Sensor v3 sensors in the last year alone and they are now carried on popular online electronics stores like Sparkfun. But even with the success we've received, we knew we still had room to improve and had a few ideas on how to make the sensor even better. So we took these ideas, mixed in some feedback from our awesome customers and built the MyoWare.\nHow does MyoWare work?\nThe MyoWare measures muscle activity through the electric potential of the muscle, commonly referred to as electromyography (or EMG for short). \nWhen your brain tells your muscle to flex, it sends an electrical signal to your muscle to start recruiting motor units (the bundles of muscle fibers that generate the force behind your muscles). \nThe harder you flex, the more motor units are recruited to generate greater muscle force. The greater the number of motor units, the more the electrical activity of your muscle increases.\nThe MyoWare will analyze this electrical activity and output an analog signal that represents how hard the muscle is being flexed. \nThe harder you flex, the higher the MyoWare output voltage will go.  \nAll our muscle sensors have had this ability but we've redesigned our sensor from the ground up to make it more user-friendly and more affordable.\n(If you want more info on how the MyoWare works, there is a more in-depth discussion at the bottom of this page and you can find the MyoWare datasheet/user's manual on our GitHub repository.)\nNew features:\nSingle supply - MyoWare won't need +/- voltage power supplies! Unlike our previous sensor, it can now be plugged directly into 3.3V through 5V development boards.\nEmbedded Electrode Connector - Electrodes now snap directly to MyoWare, getting rid of those pesky cables and making the MyoWare wearable!\nRAW EMG Output - A popular request from grad students, the MyoWare now has a secondary output of the RAW EMG waveform.\nPolarity Protected Power Pins - Our #1 customer request was to add some protection so the sensor chips don't burn out when the power is accidentally connected backwards.\nON/OFF Switch - Speaking of burning out the board, we've also added an on-board power switch so you can test your power connections more easily.\nLED Indicators - We've added two on-board LEDs one to let you know when the MyoWare's power is on and the other will brighten when your muscle flexes. \nSetup Is A Snap\nExpanding the Possibilities\n\"Good artists copy; great artists steal\" - Steve Jobs\nWith the redesign of our sensor, we decided to take a page from Arduino's playbook and incorporate the concept of \"shields\" into the MyoWare. \nWhat is a shield? Shields are modular circuit boards that piggyback onto the MyoWare to enhance it with extra functionality. We plan to release four different shields during the first year after the launch of the MyoWare:\nMyoWare Cable Shield\nThe cable shield gives the MyoWare the ability to use our more traditional cable instead of the embedded snap connectors. \nUse it for non-wearable projects that are housed in an enclosure or that target muscles that are too small or situated such that the embedded snaps would not be suitable.\nMyoWare Proto Shield\nThe Proto Shield is your typical prototype board with lots of through hole pins that are perfect for soldering any 0.100\" spaced through hole components. \nUse it to tinker with the MyoWare to your heart's content. It's a great way to add extra amplification for both the raw and standard outputs.\nMyoWare Power Shield\nThe Power Shield uses two 20mm coin cell batteries to give the MyoWare all the life-giving juice (3.3V) it needs to operate.\nMyoWare Mighty Meter Shield\nThe Mighty Meter Shield is what got us really excited about the prospect of shields. This shield takes the MyoWare output and lights up an LED bar depending on how hard you flex. The harder you flex; the more bars will light up.

(cont'd)\nAn EMG sensor measures the very tiny electrical signals generated from your muscle just like any standard voltmeter but instead of a constant voltage, these signals are waveforms (called the raw EMG signal) and look similar to audio sounds. This waveform is very useful and contains a wealth of information within it. BUT to measure how hard the muscle is flexing, you have to further process it. The MyoWare takes care of all this processing for you and outputs a voltage that represents the amount of muscle activity (also called the EMG Envelope), shown in purple above.\nWhat makes MyoWare above and beyond?\nTraditional muscle sensors output only the raw muscle sensor which requires the signal to be offset by a reference voltage (usually in the middle of the development boards* analog input range) to fit the entire signal in the positive voltage plane. However, by doing so, the resolution of the development board* is effectively cut in half. \nFor an Arduino, this would mean your system would be reduced to a 9-bit resolution (512 voltage levels = 2^9) instead of the full 10-bit resolution (1024 voltage levels = 2^10) of which the hardware is capable. You would be losing half the available voltage levels.\nMyoWare\u2019s novel circuitry allows you to take advantage of the full resolution of the development board* you\u2019re using. \nWhy does resolution matter?\nMuscle signals, like most biometrics, are analog in nature. So before we can make a muscle-controlled Rock\u2019em Sock\u2019em Robot, we need to convert it to a digital representation. This is usually done through an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) which can be found in the microcontroller embedded in a development board, the sound card of your computer, etc. The ADC will usually accept an input signal between a certain voltage range (e.g. 5V for Arduino) and have a resolution associated with it (e.g. 10 bit). The ADC is only able to differentiate between voltage levels in as many steps as it has resolution (e.g. Arduino 5V/2^10 = 4.8mV/level). The digital representation of the analog signal increases in accuracy as the resolution of the ADC increases.\nThe image above illustrates just how different the digital representation of a sine wave changes with each additional bit in resolution.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're using this campaign to not only generate pre-orders but also to offer some pretty sweet rewards and to help a lot of kids in need.

They manage the populations of BOTH target and bycatch species, they don't harvest during crucial breeding seasons, and they don't use habitat damaging fishing methods.\nAt Tidal Vision, we want to support this level of care for our ocean's eco-systems. That is why we're upcycling sustainable ocean byproducts, and it starts with...  The Salmon Leather Project.\nWe wanted to reduce waste and encourage sustainable fishing, but current aquatic tanning methods required harsh chemicals such as formaldehyde or chrome-based chemicals. \nSo we went back to the drawing board, and every ingredient in our proprietary aquatic tanning formula is certified as food-grade by the FDA.

And now, after a year and a half of development, we're ready to find our first set of alpha testers. Introducing, the Electroloom Developer Kit. \nAn Electroloom Developer Kit\nWhat it can make\nSkirts! Available as a reward to backers!\nTank tops! Available as a reward to backers!\nBeanies!\nAnd even a child-sized dress! Cute decorations not included.\nThese are just a handful of examples that we came up with to help demonstrate the capabilities of the Electroloom--and showcase that what it produces can actually be worn. \nBut these are far from limitations. We are most excited to see what you come up with to design and create--wearable or not! Make curtains or doilies or scarves or lampshades. We can't wait to be surprised and impressed by what you're able to create with the Electroloom Alpha.\nWhat it is\nThe Electroloom Developer Kit is a tool for designing and manufacturing custom 3D fabrics. When interacting with our machine, there is no need for thread, needles, or sewing. Instead, our users need only some simple CAD skills to design their patterns, and the Electroloom does the rest.\nBehind the scenes, our technology reduces the traditional textile manufacturing process into a single step. Instead of sending raw material through factories where it undergoes numerous processing steps to create a traditional textile, we are able to directly convert raw material to finished good.\nThe design process\nHow it works\nWe use an electrospinning process to convert liquid solutions into solid fibers which are then deposited onto a 3D mold. We call this process Field Guided Fabrication, or FGF. Essentially, an internal electric field inside of the machine's chamber guides fibers onto a 3D shape, where they bond together. Most people say it looks like magic. We tend to agree.\nWhat the FGF process looks like\nPLAY\n\nFibers depositing onto a tank top mold\nPLAY\n\nA timelapse of a skirt forming during the FGF process\nPLAY\n\nA timelapse of a beanie forming during the FGF process\nBy the time the job is done, the numerous fibers that have been deposited will have formed a single, seamless piece of fabric that retains the shape of the mold. \nMaterials\nWe are currently working with a custom polyester/cotton blend, which is compatible with the stock molds that the Electroloom Developer Kit ships with, and can be used to test your own custom and DIY molds. Fabrics are shipped as liquids in \"pods\" which are placed into the machine prior to each job. \nWe don't have prices for replacement fabric solutions just yet as we are hard at work on sourcing quality bulk materials for the best prices. Replacement solutions will be available for order through our website, and the Developer Kits will ship with 1.5L of polyester solution--enough to make at least 7 beanies, 4 tank tops, or 3 skirts! \nHow we're different\nTraditional 3D printed garments are typically constructed of intricate connections, like joints, that allow the material to bend and move, effectively creating chain-mail that mimics how fabrics actually move. Our material, however, is flexible and light by nature. It's composed of countless tiny fibers (on the micro and even nano-meter scale), meaning all of your designs are guaranteed to flex, drape, and fold just like you would expect fabrics to do!\nTypical drape behavior from our fabrics\nHow our fabric folds\nSo why Developer Kits?\nElectroloom is still in its infancy; we've only been working on the technology for about a year and a half. This dev kit launch with our alpha units is so that we can start to open a feedback loop outside of our own team. Kickstarter is filled with the early adopters, DIYers, and eager-for-new-tech type of people we're hoping want to experiment with Electroloom.\nThis dev kit program is a way for us to engage with early adopters, who in many ways will be the pioneers responsible for bringing this technology to fruition. We're looking for people who want to use, explore, break, hack, and improve our machines, so that ultimately we can provide a more robust and reliable technology.\nUltimately, this campaign is all about building relationships. We're here to support you--from helping with bugs, to providing design help, to even manufacturing and shipping you molds if you are unable to create them yourselves. We're excited to engage with you, and to help you be as creative as possible. \nTechnical Specifications\nTotal dimensions: 1000mm x 1080mm x 620mm\nInterior chamber: 900mm x 900mm x 600mm\nMaximum mold size: 800mm x 900mm\nVoltage range: 2-19kV (<500 microamps)\nComputer connection: USB\nCAD Drawings\nThe Rewards\nOur Kickstarter rewards.\nElectroloom's story\nIt feels like we've come a long way in just a year and a half. We literally started experimenting with chopsticks on our kitchen floor! We've gradually refined our processes and added more control to our machine.\nThe previous prototypes that got us here.\nWe finally think it's at a point where we can start to share it with people and learn from a growing community of designers and developers.\nWhat we're already working on\nThis program is just the beginning for us, and we already have lots of things in our pipeline to prepare for where we want the future of Electroloom to be. \nColor! We don't want Electroloom's future fabrics to stay white forever. Even though you can already dye existing Electroloom fabric any color you'd like, we are aiming to eliminate that extra step and produce colored fabrics with a single click. Our early tests are already working, and now we have a skilled materials scientist on board to help refine colors even further.\nOur early experiments with color - white, blue, and yellow.\nWe are also working to expand the range of materials compatible with Electroloom. So far, we have our custom polyester/cotton blend working, and we are well into optimizing our silk and acrylic fiber solutions. As you can see from the SEM images below, our process is truly capable of creating nanometer-scale fibers!\nOur materials - polyester/cotton, silk, and acrylic.\nThanks\nWe couldn't have made it here alone, and wanted to say thank you to everyone who has helped us along the way. Brit, EJ, everyone at Alternative Apparel, Adam, Brayton, Duncan, Cyril, Ben, Kristen, Arnold, Bruce, Tim, Billy, Brad, Steve and Cinesthetics, Viet, Mared, and Mac House Productions, everyone at Boost and HAX, and too many more to list. Thank you for believing in us and helping us get this far.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a new technology that has a considerable amount of development in its future. There are a lot of technical challenges that we need resources and time to solve. We want to ensure that our dev kits are not only functional in their early stage, but safe and reliable.\n\nVolume:\nRather than committing to a large volume of dev kits, we are limiting the number of units we are producing. This not only provides us and our testers a more intimate, responsive experience, but ensures that we do not stretch ourselves too thin if things go wrong. As stated previously, we will be learning a good deal from this dev kit program, and by limiting the quantity of units delivered we better enable our team to respond to and tackle tough issues.\n\nManufacturing:\nThe machines themselves are fairly simple, and easy to build, so we'll be doing this ourselves to test each of these dev units before they go out. Moreover, because of the small size of this production run, it means that we are dealing with a more manageable supply chain. After spending 4 months in Shenzhen, China establishing relationships with vendors and manufacturers, we are ready to manage this volume of Developer Kits.\n\nSafety:\nBecause we deal with electric fields and sophisticated electronics, we want to ensure that we are not introducing any hazards to our users.

The store would be a great asset to the community and help give kids and young adults a place to come and hang out and play games. This shop would start as a Magic store and eventually expanded into a full gaming store carrying all of the best games to include table top games and maybe even video games. I would also like to eventually expand into carrying comic books and graphic novels as well. One thing that I have always wanted to do since I first got into Magic the Gathering was open my own shop and make it the best shop out there. I would want to make it a fun and friendly store by making it a fun place to play and just chill at. The gaming area I would like to have would have leather chairs instead of the traditional folding chairs and real wooden tables to give it the vibe of being at home while still having that competitive atmosphere. One of the first thing I will do once I raise the funds needed would be to get a storefront and all the amenities and product, then start out hosting tournaments and see where that leads. Once we are up and running then I would reinvest most of the profits back into the store making it bigger and better all the time while keeping up with the competition and still keeping to the fun and interactive environment that I hope will be there. I want to make this gaming store the best one out there and eventually open up more stores in different areas bringing fun and entertainment to all.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks involved in this project are not as many as you would think but are still not small risks. Most small businesses fail within the first year and that is due to poor planning, lack of profits or not making enough profits to cover their overhead costs. With that in mind I will break down as best I can what expenses I believe we will have and how we hope to turn a profit. First major expense is the initial start up costs and that would be the cost to get a business license, storefront, product to sell, amenities ( shelves , tables, chairs, etcetera) , and any cost that go with those items such as fees for carrying WOTC product and distributor fees. The funding that I am trying to raise should be enough to cover all of this and allow us to pay for two to four months rent on a storefront depending on the price and location of said storefront. As for the cost of doing daily business it should be minimal as we would be able to buy product from WOTC and distributors for about $72 per booster box and turn a profit on each box of about $15-$20 depending on the market and how quickly we can move it. The real profits will come from single Magic cards selling them at the market price. The other expenses that we will have are standard cost of doing business and those are things like rent, utilities, Internet , phone and employees wages. Since this business will be ran by myself and a friend we have agreed to split the profits minus what we put back into the business for expansion and advertising. This will allow us to cut some of the cost of having regular employees until we grow and become a thriving business. As for the overhead cost I do not foresee it being more than four to five thousand a month including all the utilities and products. With that in mind to stay in the black we would need to sell at least $58 a day to just break even. With tournaments brining in customers every Friday for Friday Night Magic we will hopefully be able to move quite a bit of product not to include single cards and card accessories such as sleeves and dice. Another risk is that we won't have customers and that would mean no profits. This could very well happen but I have checked into the area and from what I have seen the customer base is there and we would be the only shop within twenty miles that host tournaments and sells single cards. With all the risks payed out and a good business strategy I believe we can make this store a profitable business and make it a good thing for the surrounding communities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Brandon Winfrey\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am a husband and father of three boys ages 6,4, and 1.

The new system would be 20ft high by 40ft wide, plus 15ft high and 12ft wide wing shades.\nThe new pipe and drape system will allow PCT to create an 3ft orchestra sound wall. As there is no \"pit\" in any of our performance spaces, we currently line chairs around the orchestra and drape it with fabric to soften the sound for the audience that is sitting near the orchestra.\nA new pipe and drape system would allow PCT to move away from the traditional \"drawing room\" box set, and experiment with new staging. \nEach of the past two seasons, PCT has rent a pipe and drape system for their summer production. This has cost the theatre over $500 per rental, and was not as tall or wide as the system that we would like to purchase. We would like to eliminate the necessity of spending money on a rental, and rather purchase a system.\nIf fundraising is successful, PCT will order the new pipe and drape system at the end of May. This pipe and drape system will be featured in the set design for PCT's Summer production of 1776.\nPCT views this as a long-term investment in the theatre. Instead of asking for funds for a specific show, we are asking for an investment that will benefit numerous productions a season, for many seasons to come. \nShould additional funds be pledged, PCT will use these funds to purchase additional wireless microphones, a new spotlight, lighting equipment, and other long-term investments for the theatre.\nAs a thank you, we have several rewards depending on your level of donation.\nReward #1   $1 or more: Our thanks and the warm fuzzies you get for supporting Live Local Theatre.

Haberdasher invites its audience to spend a random Sunday with this off-balanced group of friends as they sift through the conflicting gossip concerning the whereabouts and well-being of Charlotte Ebbinger, an unpublished poet with a food fetish. Was her death a suicide? Was it a murder? Is she even dead? Directed by Hollie Klem, The Maderati explores what it really means to be an artist and, certainly more importantly, what it means to be \"a well rounded person.\" Through their hilariously obnoxious antics, the show's characters offer a satirical look at what we really value. Is it fame, artistic merit, or honest human interaction?\nThis take on Richard Greenberg\u2019s, The Maderati promises to present characters you\u2019ll love to hate. In this hilarious portrait of the artists who make up New York City, these artists take on the challenge of holding themselves and their audience up to the glass. What they find is certainly loaded with comic value, sometimes hitting dangerously close to home!\nThe Production Company:\nThis production is sure to build upon the company\u2019s reputation for developing highly entertaining, thought-provoking performance art. A theatre company with nine seasons under its belt. The company began when a small group of freshly graduated actors decided to take matters into their own hands and produce Remember Me, written by Adam Wier. With his words, as well as the artistic vision of  Hollie Klem, Executive Artistic Director and the rest of the creative team, they founded Haberdasher Theatre Inc., a company that has produced dozens of shows, events, readings and workshops including Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus, Arnold Schulman\u2019s Lost, Euripides\u2019 The Cyclops, Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice in Wonderland, and Mac Wellman\u2019s Dracula.\n\nThe company has also adapted, directed, and performed children's stories by both Barefoot Books and Lewis Carol at venues such as FAO Schwartz, NYC and Books of Wonder, NYC.  They also hold seasonal special topic workshops for theatre artists in New York, AND NOW WITH YOUR HELP, OHIO.  Talk-backs and themed soir\u00e9es highlight their commitment to fostering the exchange of dialogue between artist and audience.\nThe move To Ohio:\nWith all the above under the Haberdasher Theatre's belt, Klem decided to put the company's dream of expansion and her personal nine year dream of growing a branch in her native state into action.\n\" The Columbus arts scene is fantastic, and it's the people who make it so! I am so excited as I already have some very wonderful, Ohio based artists, performers and designers who want to team up with Haberdasher Theatre for this production. Ohio has been wonderful to me and the arts scene has welcomed me with open arms. Now it is time to pay this wonderful community back with some sharp, well executed theatre. Therefor, I am bringing a Haberdasher top favored script and my personal favorite comedy to kick us off. It is hilarious and I know for a fact people from all walks will love it and be doubled over in laughter.\"  \n\"My goal with this play is to have Haberdasher Theatre Ohio branch embrace the infectious spirits that Ohio is known for and play with the classic, eclectic, flavors of the New York arts scene to form a vividly witty show that will leave that audience smiling long after the curtain has gone down.\"\n    -Hollie Klem\nCheck us out at www.haberdashertheatre.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"I am tackling a HUGE task by growing a branch of Haberdasher Theatre here in Columbus Ohio and while I am aware of and am so thankful to have the moral support of the community in NY, it is still a fact that I must grow this branch from the ground up with limited resources. \" \n\nIn the theatre, a lack of funding discourages risk-taking. For Haberdasher Theatre's most ambitious projects we turn to the community-funding model, through this we can ensure our artists and designers will have the time, energy, and resources necessary to let their imaginations run wild and produce a unique and unforgettable theater experience FOR YOU and the Columbus arts community. This project has two prominent challenges, networking and quality costs. Your funding allows us to clear those hurdles.\n\nNETWORKING COSTS: \nA top priority for Haberdasher is to LISTEN to our community's needs and delights, then produce solutions. Hearing the Columbus community voice and building a pivotal presence that caters to the NEEDS of the Ohio arts community by way of marketing and outreach. The resources and technology for this do not come cheap. Your donation will open the doors of communication so we can produce a product that will respect the vast capacity and validity of the imagination of YOU the viewer. \n\nQUALITY PRODUCT: \nA top priority for Haberdasher is to RESPECT QUALITY, from the art to the artists. Everyone is always in search for quality products and your source of entertainment should be no different. The team I need for this project is of the best quality, award winning even. However these quality artists and designers did not become so strong by using shoddy material and disrespecting their craft by rushing their work.

This is a story we cannot tell without you. \nAvailable Light Theatre will create a locally-sourced, original theatre production about the people of Columbus, Ohio. We will spend one year talking to as many citizens of Greater Columbus as possible. Throughout the year, we will share highlights from these conversations. Then, we will create a multi-media, true-to-life exploration that reflects the entire fabric of our city. On-stage, we'll render the fullness of life in our community: from the trendsetters of the moment to the difference-makers of tomorrow, and -- most importantly -- the voices that we don\u2019t ordinarily get to hear. \nAs our beloved hometown grows and changes, it is absolutely vital that we have a way to respond. In this day and age, when we are continually more separated, the best thing that theatre does -- and it\u2019s what theatre does better than anything else -- is to bring people together to remember, to reflect, and to start a conversation. We need to talk to you, to learn from you. We need your voice. \nLet\u2019s talk about: - How do you make meaning in your life, in your art, in your home? - What matters most in your job, in your family, in your community? - Columbus is a land of opportunity, but for what? - What can we make and accomplish, individually and together?\nThis is the kind of work that Available Light has been making for 10 years. It will be a celebration, an investigation, and a city-wide collaboration. We want to use our skills, our tools, and our decade of experience to give back to this city that has given so much to us.\nWe want to Feed Your Soul, Columbus. We want to share your stories with the world. And we want to share the whole journey with you.\nAvailable Light is a fellowship of artists dedicated to building a more conscious and compassionate world by creating joyful and profound theatre and serving our community.\nWe produce bold creations by local artists and important new plays by writers from around the globe. We are committed to developing local talent, contributing to the arts scene, and making Columbus a better place to be. Our original creations have lauded by American Theatre magazine, the Cincinnati Entertainment Awards, NYtheatre dot com, the Central Ohio Theatre Critics Circle, the Jebbys, the Greater Columbus Arts Council\u2019s Artistic Excellence Awards, and more.

But if you take away their wildly different characteristics --  ages, occupations, life-styles, ethnicities -- what you really have is a room full of people who care about art and the world around them.\nWe measure our success by our ability to attract a collective of artists that accurately reflects our community; by our ability to share the stories and unique viewpoints of the people of Central Ohio; and by ensuring that our productions are affordable to everyone in town. We achieve that success when the breadth and depth of our community is reflected on stage, in the audience, and in every facet of our production process.\nEveryone deserves great art.\nPay What You Want is just what it sounds like: every seat for every show for everybody. Now more than ever, we all need great art. And now, more than ever, we can\u2019t let economic circumstances shut anyone out of the theatre. It\u2019s simply a better world when we can all afford to see good shows, no matter how much cash we\u2019ve got in our pockets at the moment.\nIn our 10th year we will not rest, we will continue to question the answers and fight resistance and make new work.\nWe\u2019ve got a season full of exciting shows and experiments including:\nan important, imaginative, new American play\na radical adaptation of a notorious 100-year old novel\na one-man comedy by \"a Samuel Beckett for the John Stewart generation\"\na new company-created original work about movement and the body\nThe Next Stage iInitiative - helping to nurture new plays and new playwrights\na 24-hour theatre spectacular\nOne Night with Available Light.

Now we're ready for a project of this magnitude.\n\nHow do we reach out and connect with groups of people within Columbus who are un-like us?\n- Columbus is rich in a variety of organizations serving many different constituencies. We will partner with these groups to re-learn the skill of approaching those who are unlike us with honesty and authenticity. \n\nHow do we guarantee that the finished project reaches a wide audience of our fellow citizens?\n- Our year-long process of outreach and discovery will create a large group with an inherent interest in the show, and we'll launch the finished project with the help of all the new friends we make along the way. (We also hope our Kickstarter backers will help us get the word out!)\n\nHow do we maintain momentum for an entire year while producing other works of art?\n- The most important aspect of Available Light's maturation over the past few years has been our increased ability to successfully juggle several projects, each at different stages of development. We excel at long-term development and have learned to turn this problem to our advantage.\n\nHow can we find a venue for the show which reflects the city as much as the production will?\n- Pay What You Want has removed one obstacle for attendees - cost.

In other words, you can attempt to pillage, occupy, or convert this Province to your cause.\nThe Roman player first moves one of his Triremes to Mare Africum. He then transports three Legions from Italia to attack the Egyptians in Cyrenaica!\nHeroes and Wonders give a player special abilities and extra levels on the Leadership Tracks.\nAs you grow your empire and/or acquire new Heroes and Wonders, you will be moving your Empire's track marker up the Trade, Culture and Military tracks. The leader in each track gains additional powers and benefits.  \nYou can win the game through:\nCulture by building the Great Pyramids\nTrade and Growth by attaining five Heroes and/or Wonders\nMilitary by controlling four Capitals and/or Legendary Cities\nPolitics by claiming all three Trade, Culture and Military Leadership Titles.\nMare Nostrum is a deep game of resource development, trade, and strategy.  \nBackers will be able to choose an English, French, German, Italian, Polish, or Spanish language edition on the Kickstarter survey at the end of this campaign. \nClick Here to download a Draft Copy of the Mare Nostrum Rules from our website.\nADD ONS - We are offering some very nice Add-Ons that you can add to your pledge.

Our non-English partners are all well established companies with excellent track records. However, Academy Games has NO control over our non-English partners and can take no responsibility for their order fulfillment.\n\nAcademy Games and Asyncron:\nOur first three Kickstarter projects, '1775 - Rebellion', 'Freedom - The Underground Railroad', and 'Fief - France 1429' were very successful. Our growing success with each new project brought about new challenges, from which we learned a lot. Our last project 'Fief - France 1429' was so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. Although this added a lot of value, it also added unforeseen development and production delays. However, our supporters agree that the end results were worth the wait. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive. \n \nWith Mare Nostrum, all stretch goals and game expansions have been fully developed and play tested. Most of the artwork is finalized and manpower has been scheduled and set aside to make sure that Mare Nostrum - Empires will ship in a timely manner world wide. \n\nWe appreciate your Kickstarter support, which allows us to continue to create unique and high quality games.

We want to improve access to healthy, affordable, cooked meals in low-income neighborhoods. So, this year we are launching a mobile food truck that will serve on-the-go meals made with fresh, locally sourced, organic ingredients. While the truck will target neighborhoods with limited access to healthy, high quality foods, we are committed to serving the entire Greater Cincinnati Area.\nWe also plan to hold healthy cooking classes in the communities we serve. Instructors will lead participants in preparing and cooking meals, while sharing tips on cooking, budgeting, where to shop for recipe ingredients and more.\nThe FOH Team serving up food to volunteers planting a garden in Cincinnati's East End.\nThe Menu\nChile Lime Chicken Burger\nOur menu is inspired by Cincinnati's ethnically and racially diverse neighborhoods. We believe in providing innovative, healthy and tasty alternatives to the norm; made fresh daily with ingredients sourced from local farms and businesses. Signature items include gourmet burgers, like the Sammy Whammy, artisan style sandwiches like the Italian Job, specialty flat bread pizzas and more. We will also offer seasonal chopped salads made daily with fresh vegetables. We will make all of our garnishes, sauces and dressings in house, using the freshest ingredients. We strive to source our meats locally when practical and feasible.\nThe Fire On High Team\nMeet the Co-Founders\nTisha and Diedra planting flowers at Cincinnati Early Learning Centers\nTisha Bullock, Organic Gardener, Raw Food Chef and social entrepreneur of Fire On High. Tisha has lived and worked in Cincinnati all of her life. Several years ago, reoccurring bouts with food allergies caused her to examine the foods she was eating and the way these foods were grown and prepared. She understands the importance of providing people with nourishing foods that promote health and wholeness. She is passionate about encouraging and empowering people to reclaim their health.\nDiedra Bullock, a Cincinnati native, became a health food advocate when her sister began suffering from severe food allergies in 2010. She dedicated herself to researching organic and natural food and herb alternatives, and healthy cooking techniques to nourish and rebuild the bodies immune system. In 2012, desiring to teach others what they had learned through their own life experiences, the two sisters developed the idea for Fire On High, a roving community supported kitchen specializing in teaching people how to cook with seasonal, organic, unprocessed, natural foods, herbs and spices.\nWhere You Come In!\nAccessing healthy, affordable foods in low-income neighborhoods can be difficult. The inability of low-income residents to pay for pricey health food alternatives, and the proximity of most health food stores and supermarkets to these areas, greatly limits the availability of quality food resources. Corner stores, fast food chains and pizza joints have become the most widely available food options. We need your help to change this.\nIn order to bring our delicious, fresh, healthy meals to Cincinnati, we need your help to put our first food truck on the road. If you believe in our mission and want to help us make this dream a reality please donate to our campaign. With your support we will be able to get our truck on the road by the summer!!!\nWe already own the truck, in fact, it's already been wrapped!!! We've saved enough money to draw up plans, put up a few walls, plumbing and basic electrical stuff, but we need your help to finish the project.\nFire On High Food Truck\n Here's what we still need to get rolling, and the costs:\nStainless Steel Walls - $1,100\nStainless Steel Shelving - $1,500\nElectric Deep Fryer - $1,786\nSandwich Prep Station - $1,500\nRefrigeration - $1,300\nPots and Pans - $1,052\nKitchen Equipment (knives, thermometers, etc.) - $240\nElectric Water Heater - $420\n Food Service Supplies (Utensils, Napkins, Cups, etc.) - $493\nFresh and Gray Water Tanks - $160\nHot Holding Cabinet - $4,149.95\nAir Conditioning - $1,173.56\nOutdoor Lighting - $125.49\nTOTAL $15,000\nYour support will help us reach our goal!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're on a tight timeline to get the truck up and rolling before the end of summer. The longer we delay our project, the more likely we will miss out on our busiest season of the year (June through November), which means, we would be looking at a later launch date, possibly next year.\n\nWe recognize that our commitment to sourcing most of our food locally and selling it at affordable prices comes with a set of challenges that require building a strong network of partnerships and strategic planning. \nWe've put together an advisory committee comprised of food truck owners, local businesses and farmers, who have helped us develop a business model that we believe will translate into a profitable food truck business.\n\nThis will be a special truck that we hope will be recognized in our communities and throughout the city, as a force for change - where everyone can afford to eat well.

We need your support to help us purchase equipment for larger batches. Please choose one of our awesome rewards to help us grow! At the $25 level, you'll join our Pig Pen, and at $100 you can be part of our exclusive Sky Pen. Both clubs give you special access to top secret flavors! What are you waiting for? Contribute!\nWHAT IS KOMBUCHA?\nIt's a fermented, probiotic, live culture tea. Some say it reminds them of cider. Others compare it to some beer or champagne. Even though it tastes like an adult beverage, kombucha is refreshing in a non-alcoholic way.\nWHAT'S SKINNY PIGGY?\nSkinny Piggy Kombucha is a small kombucha brewery in Cincinnati, Ohio. People have fallen in love with our Original Tea Blend, which is a unique blend of premium teas ethically sourced from IntegriTEA. We started making kombucha in the northern Kentucky Incubator Kitchen in 2014, and last summer had a blast selling kombucha on draft at the Covington Farmers Market. Since then, it's flown off store shelves in Cincinnati, Kentucky, and West Virginia.\nSelling kombucha on draft at our stand!\nOur old home in the Northern Kentucky Incubator Kitchen!\nTHE NEED\nGrowing demand for Skinny Piggy is exceeding our ability to brew it with our current equipment. This Kickstarter campaign will allow us to buy fermentation tanks, which will scale our production significantly. Then we can sell our product to some larger customers, including a regional distributor and Whole Foods.\nSome of the equipment we'll need!\nOUR NEW HOME\nWhen we finally get our new equipment, we'll move into the Urban Artifact Brewery in Northside. They've got some extra space and will be happy to guide us in our expansion.\nUrban Artifact - our new home!\nHOW WE'RE REFRESHING OURSELVES\nCurrently all of our bottled kombucha is our delicious Original Tea Blend. However, we've been brewing a bunch of different flavors for ourselves, and would love to share them with everybody. Once we're big enough we'll be able to bottle it the wildest, most exciting flavors!\nWhat's this cool flavor? We wish we could share it!\nWe'll also be rolling out cool new bottle designs in the near future! See below for our current bottle design and what's coming next!\nOld bottle design to the left, and new one on the right!\nREWARD LEVELS - PIG PEN\nFor any pledge above $25, you'll be part of the Pig Pen. That means when we'll hold a cool event, you'll get an invite. When we want to do some community service, you'll help us decide what to do. When we don't know what type of flavor to make, you'll vote. Best of all, you'll receive a one liter grolsh top bottle. Bring it to any Pig Pen event, and we'll fill it up with a special brew for $5!\nREWARD LEVEL - SKY PEN\nWith a pledge of just $100 or more, you'll join the Sky Pen and enjoy all the benefits of the Pig Pen, plus you'll get invited to do some extra taste-testing to help us determine which new kombucha flavors are the best!\nREWARDS\n$25 - backer glass + Pig Pen growler\n$35 - Backer t-shirt + Pig Pen growler\n$100 - fan boy or fan girl starter kit + Sky Pen growler\n$250 - You and a friend go on a brew tour with lots of kombucha + Pig Pen growler\nThanks to all these partners who helped us create custom kombucha packages!\nCraft Connection - giving you the best Cincinnati brewing experience!\nWhy taxi when you can Tesla?\nEven tiles brings the cool tunes!\n                       Urban Artifact - making some great beers!\nGreat local treats from the northern Kentucky Incubator Kitchen!\n Video by Elevant Productions - www.elevantproductions.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce we have the money for our new equipment, it may take a couple months to install the equipment and make sure it can make our delicious kombucha.

After lift-off from Cape Canaveral as a secondary payload on an Atlas V rocket, our ground stations at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Georgia Tech communicated with LightSail as it deployed its solar sails and captured images. The LightSail test mission ended there, but with your help we can make our second spacecraft truly sail on sunlight during its primary mission in 2016.\nGoal Update: Next Destination \u2013 $1,240,000!\nThe milestones keep falling away, and our biggest milestone, the BIG stretch going from $550,000 all the way to $1 million, is now behind us. And this is because of you, our backers. Thank you! \nIn the months ahead, we're going to be really busy applying lessons learned from our test flight. The LightSail project team will make critical investments and apply the lessons learned from our test flight and ensure success of the primary mission in 2016. We completed the original construction of the spacecraft four years ago, so some updates are now warranted. The LightSail flight system electronics and software will be upgraded to the most current versions to ensure that they are reliable and thoroughly tested. We will also be examining and revising the power system (batteries and electronics) to avoid the types of problems we encountered during the test flight. The on-board cameras will also likely get an upgrade to the most current versions. \nOn the ground, we will put the LightSail spacecraft through an extended series of tests and simulations to drive out issues related to long-term flight, and we will be bringing in a number of highly experienced expert consultants to thoroughly review the LightSail design and operations plans. \n We will provide resources to better support the network of volunteer observers, which was invaluable during the test flight. With them, we will improve our ability track and observe LightSail while directly involving amateur communities in mission operations. \n The list of our best ideas at this stage include: \nFlight Upgrades\n Avionics Upgrade Power System Revision \nCamera Upgrade \nRedundant Burnwire system \nGround Station Upgrades \n Add & Validate 3rd Ground Station \nEnhance Ground Station for Testing \nContract for Subsystem Experts \nDuplicate Benchsat \nSet-Up Dedicated Operations Comms Network \nCrowd Sourced Mission Operations \nStaffing - create a part-time liaison position \nDedicated Web Portal \n\"How-to\" videos on setting up ground stations as well as processing and delivering data to mission control \nGrants for Amateur Ground Observers \nThe full plan for upgrades will be developed and presented at a major project review meeting scheduled for mid-July. The Flight System Upgrades are still being pulled together, and more information is yet needed on those costs. However, the Ground Station Upgrades and Crowd Sourced Mission Operations pieces are budgeted and are estimated to cost $186,000 and $54,000, respectively. These two pieces, then, comprise our $240,000 stretch goal. \nThis past year, I had some fun learning a new strategic planning term\u2014the BHAG or Big Hairy Audacious Goal. I changed it up a bit to the BHAAG, or Big Hairy Audacious Achievable Goal. Yes, $240,000 is a big number, but it's achievable if the backer community supports us. We have over 19,500 backers (soon to be 20,000?) which means that if everyone added just $12 to their pledge, we can make this goal. \nHow amazing is that? Over 19,000 backers and another 42,000 Planetary Society members joining together to power a mission to demonstrate a CubeSat propulsion system at a fraction of the cost of a government program. With each of us doing just a little bit more, we can make big thing happen. That's the power of democratized space exploration! \nWhen we hit $1,240,000, we will also unlock our next stretch goal reward for all $35+ backers. But guess what? We didn't have a plan for a post-$1 million stretch goal! So, we are improvising because you pushed us farther and farther. If we get to the $1.24 million stretch goal, we will put everyone who has backed us for $35 or more into a giant pool and randomly select one of you to join us for our post-LightSail symposium to fulfill and critical task\u2014you will become a volunteer blogger for us and attend our symposium as a representative of the backer community. \nIt is important to note that the winner will have some very real responsibilities. We will expect you to post and/or tweet about what you are learning, and to post updates for the project backers. We can't bring all 20,000 backers to the symposium, but be can bring one of you to represent the community. How cool is that? And there will have to be some legal \"fine print,\" of course. You will have to be an adult. And, we will limit airfare to the value of a domestic US fare, and we will cover food and lodging for the trip, only. If you are an international backer, you will still be eligible, but you will have to be responsible for all passport and visa issues (though we will provide any necessary administrative support). And last, the we will cap the total costs that we will provide or reimburse at $2,500. If unforeseen legal issues arise, then we will make a good faith effort to resolve them while reserving the right to offer a different stretch goal reward to this community in place of this one. So, with those caveats, we would like to offer this outstanding stretch goal reward opportunity. Make sure you can qualify for this reward by spreading to word! \nThe final days of the campaign are just ahead of us. It's exciting!  Let's change the world!  \nLightSail: The People\u2019s Spacecraft\nI\u2019m Bill Nye, CEO of The Planetary Society. Yes, the Science Guy is also the Planetary Guy. I invite you to come along on a cosmic journey with me by participating in a mission to sail a spacecraft, a tiny CubeSat no bigger than a breadbox, on beams of light. Imagine it: unlimited free energy from the Sun will provide CubeSats with propulsion and revolutionize access to space for low-cost citizen projects\u2014projects like ours or by teams of students and faculty at universities. This means that spacecraft, especially small ones like CubeSats, won't have to carry heavy fuels into orbit, and that the acceleration will be continuous. Even better, this is a journey that is directly funded by the world\u2019s citizens, like you, rather than by governments. LightSail\u2122 is truly \u201cthe people\u2019s spacecraft.\u201d\nOur LightSail mission will be the culmination of the hopes and dreams of our visionary founders, Louis Friedman, Bruce Murray and Carl Sagan. Some of you may remember Carl famously promoting solar sailing on Johnny Carson\u2019s The Tonight Show.\nLightSail is a huge contribution to space science and exploration. To learn more about this amazing project, check out our dedicated website at sail.planetary.org. Through this proof-of-concept mission, we will use CubeSats to open new paths beyond Earth and, one day, potentially to other planets with an inexpensive, inexhaustible means of propulsion: photons, solar energy in its purest form. We need backers like you to join us in getting to this epic point in space exploration history. LightSail propulsion truly holds the promise\u2014dare I say it?\u2014to change the world!\nTo tweet this, click here.  \nTo post on Facebook, click here.   \nLightSail\u2019s Moment in the Sun\nIt\u2019s going to be a big year for LightSail\u2014we\u2019re headed to space! First, we will test our prototype this month and next by flying it in low-Earth orbit for about 30 days. While our Kickstarter campaign runs, you\u2019ll be able to follow along in real-time as we validate the deployment of our sail booms in zero gravity as well as other key spacecraft characteristics. This is a huge opportunity for us to learn and apply lessons from the test program to the primary mission currently scheduled for fall 2016.  \nHere\u2019s where you come in. The final bill for LightSail is projected at $5.45 million, of which we have just over $1.2 million left to raise. We\u2019re nearly there, but our final push will be critical to getting to the launch pad next year. So we\u2019re reaching out to the Kickstarter community for backing at this key moment. We invite you to get on board the mission and help LightSail soar. Without your support, the project can\u2019t happen.\nWe don\u2019t expect to get this all from one source at one time, but you can put us on the trajectory to launching in 2016. We are setting an ambitious Kickstarter goal of $200,000, with stretch goals that take us all the way up to the $1 million mark. These goals will take us from 1) spacecraft construction, integration and testing; 2) through orbital operations (actual solar sailing!); 3) to data collection, analysis, and publication of results; and 4) a slew of public awareness and education activities to make sure solar sailing is widely noticed and adopted.\nAnd as we reach our stretch goals, we will unlock special digital-only rewards for all backers of $35 or more, like a video of our day-in-the-life test, an image from space, LightSail spacecraft schematics, and a copy of our symposium publication. Please be sure to share this project with your friends and fellow space-enthusiasts! \nThat\u2019s Right, There Are Rewards!\nWe invite you to join the LightSail mission team as a backer who supports space science and exploration. YOU can help unleash the potential of low-cost, citizen-funded exploration. When you get on board, we\u2019ll send you some fantastic rewards such as a \u201csquare centimeter of sail,\u201d an exclusive mission patch, LightSail t-shirt, a LightSail-gazing kit, limited edition LightSail poster, and lots, lots more including even sending your name to space on LightSail in 2016! We've worked with Planetary Society partners, a couple of which may be familiar to the Kickstarter community, like Chop Shop, ISS Above and Celestron to create these opportunities. All backers of $35 or more who are not already members will get a one-year individual membership in The Planetary Society\u2014the world's largest space advocacy organization. Note: all of our rewards will ship anywhere in the world (fees will be added at checkout), but backers are individually responsible for any local customs fees.\nHere are a few samples of what\u2019s in store for you: \nOur stunning embroidered LightSail Mission Patch, designed by our friends and partners at Chop Shop, which will also be the signature image on our sticker, collectible pin, t-shirt, hat and hoodie: \nOr, our exclusive, limited edition LightSail commemorative poster, also designed by our friends at Chop Shop (it's poster #6 is from a larger Spacecraft Series):\nBased on demand, we are excited to offer some of our Planetary Society swag.

The spacecraft is undergoing modifications and integration at Ecliptic Enterprises. Subsystems checks are underway, with functional testing scheduled to be complete by the end of June. Upcoming milestones for the primary spacecraft, all subject to change as the work unfolds, include:\nMay - July 2015\u2014Prototype flight operations and analysis\nJuly 2015\u2014Test readiness review for system level testing  \nJuly 2015\u2014Final subsystem and software tests\nAugust 2015\u2014Day in the Life test (a run-through of all mission-related activities for the spacecraft)\nSeptember 2015\u2014Vibration and T-Vac Testing\nOctober 2015\u2014LightSail readiness and pre-ship review \nOctober 2015\u2014integrate into launch canister\nDecember 2015\u2014LightSail craft completed; ready for launch!\nDetails on the Mission \nLightSail is a citizen-funded project that will make solar sail propulsion a reality for CubeSats and other small spacecraft!\nTest Flight \nMay 2015 We are flying our prototype right now, this very month! And you can follow along on by becoming a backer for our Kickstarter project, or by following us at sail.planetary.org.\nFollowing three years of painstaking design and testing, we\u2019re testing to see how LightSail flies. This month and next, May and June 2015, the first prototype LightSail CubeSat will hitch a ride to orbit aboard an Atlas V rocket for a shakedown cruise. This flight is sponsored by NASA\u2019s Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program which helps CubeSat operators find free rides to orbit. The Atlas V rocket's primary payload is a classified U.S. Air Force mission called AFSPC-5 (an Air Force Space Command acronym). \nWe won\u2019t fly high enough above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for solar sailing, due to atmospheric drag, but we\u2019ll do critical tests of several systems over a 28+ day mission, including a zero-gravity test of our sail deployment sequence and attempt to snap pictures documenting the operation of the booms that support the sails. About one week after sail deployment, with its work finished, LightSail\u2019s orbit will decay due to atmospheric drag, and it will burn-up on re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \nThe purpose of this first flight is to \u201cbuy down risk,\u201d as NASA might say. There are bound to be hiccups, and that\u2019s the point\u2014to learn and apply lessons from the prototype to the primary mission scheduled for 2016. For a detailed timeline of events during the test flight, check out Jason Davis\u2019 blog.\nPrimary Mission: Flight 2016\nThe 2016 mission will mark the first controlled, Earth-orbiter solar sail flight and we'll ride along with the first operational launch of SpaceX\u2019s new Falcon Heavy rocket. LightSail will team-up with Prox-1, a small spacecraft designed by Georgia Tech to demonstrate automated rendezvous and inspection techniques.\nTogether, LightSail and Prox-1 will be released into an orbit with an altitude of 720 kilometers (447 miles), high enough to avoid atmospheric drag. Prox-1 will gently eject LightSail into open space, and a few days later will rendezvous with LightSail to inspect it from all angles. When LightSail unfurls its sails, Prox-1 will be nearby to capture images of the big moment. \nOperations 2016: Solar Sailing \nOnce in space, LightSail\u2019s solar arrays will swing open, revealing the inside of the spacecraft. On command, four metal booms will slowly unwind, just like a tape measure, unfolding four triangular, Mylar sails. Each sail is just 4.5 microns thick\u2014one-fourth the thickness of the typical trash bag. Together, the sails span over 32 square meters\u2014large enough to provide real propulsion using only sunlight. \nWhen the sails deploy, the real action will begin as the mission control team puts LightSail through its paces. As LightSail soars around Earth, its shiny sails may be visible to the naked eye. Thanks to the folks at N2YO.com, our LightSail dashboard webpage (you can see our beta-version here) will provide status and telemetry data, and we'll organize viewing campaigns to show people where, when and how to look. Our researchers and others around the world will follow our progress as we experiment with and demonstrate this new technology. This operations phase will provide critical data to be used in the design and engineering of future solar sailing spacecraft\u2014and a new era in space travel will be born! \nPost-Mission LightSail Review\nWith the mission complete, it will be time to assess the performance of LightSail and to share it with NASA and private industry partners for adoption into other space exploration efforts. The LightSail team already meets regularly with NASA to compare technical notes, and the space agency will be watching with the rest of the world when LightSail\u2019s first images are downloaded.\nThe team and other partners will collect data for analysis, and team members will present findings in a variety of academic and industry forums. The Planetary Society also has plans to host a LightSail Symposium to summarize and share key lessons learned and to actively promote the further adoption of this technology by NASA and other space organizations.\nThe Impact  \nLightSail represents a major leap forward in the concept and technology of solar sailing. Through this program, we're making it possible for other groups, including NASA, to utilize this innovative propulsion technique on CubeSats and other small spacecraft\u2014opening the door to a huge variety of low-cost missions throughout the solar system. With LightSail as the pathfinder, CubeSats propelled solely by sunlight will be able to regularly leave Earth for interplanetary destinations.  \nThe next few steps are already within view. In 2018, the Space Launch System\u2019s inaugural flight will send the Orion spacecraft on an uncrewed lap around the moon. Hitching a ride to lunar orbit will be two NASA-built solar sail CubeSats: Lunar Flashlight and NEA Scout. Lunar Flashlight will circle the Moon, adjusting its position via solar sailing, and using its sails to reflect sunlight into the Moon\u2019s permanently shadowed craters for scientific observations. NEA Scout (the NEA stands for Near Earth Asteroid) will use its solar sails to spiral out of lunar orbit entirely, heading for a rendezvous with an asteroid.\nLightSail in the News \nBecause of its revolutionary approach, LightSail has inspired a great deal of attention from the media, with over 200 stories generated since January of this year alone. Worldwide, it has appeared in outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the industry-insider SpaceNews, and CNET.com, just to name a few. \nRecently LightSail made an appearance on national television during a segment by CBS Evening News. \nFeatured in the video was Planetary Society Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Vaughn, who spoke about LightSail\u2019s mission to demonstrate the viability of solar sailing for small spacecraft. \u201cWe really hope to kick-start a process where others now take the technology and make it better,\u201d she said. Also speaking about the project was Ecliptic Enterprises Corporation CEO Rex Ridenoure, who hosted CBS News during a recent tour of his company. Ecliptic is LightSail\u2019s integrating contractor for testing and flight readiness. The spacecraft shown in Ecliptic\u2019s clean room was actually the primary vehicle, dubbed LightSail-B, which is being prepped for our primary mission in 2016\u2014a ride to orbit on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy next year. The LightSail prototype has actually been shipped to Cape Canaveral, Fla., where it awaits a May 20 launch aboard an Atlas V rocket. \nHere\u2019s a short list of more news stories covering LightSail in the US and around the world: The Verge, TechTimes, Huffington Post, engadget, blastr, slashgear, IGN, Mirror, Adrenaline, webwereld, MOBILEGEEKS, cnBeta, ExtremeTech, Gizmodo, and NPR.  \nCool LightSail Extras\u2014Videos & Selfies\nWhile there a lot more great videos at planetary.org/tv (check out The Planetary Society SciTech Channel in particular), check out Light Sail - Flight by Light here:   \nAnd while LightSail may be too small to carry an astronaut, it's not too small to take YOU!

It is involved in research and engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, exploration, public outreach, and political advocacy. Founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, it has over 40,000 members from more than one hundred countries around the world. The Society is dedicated to the exploration of the Solar System, the search for Near Earth Objects, and the search for extraterrestrial life. The society's mission is \u201cTo empower the world's citizens to advance space science and exploration.\u201d To learn more, visit www.planetary.org.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou may have heard this before, but it bears mentioning here: space is hard. Indeed, the entire LightSail project is a proof-of-concept experiment, and there is no guaranteed outcome. Despite genius engineering and painstaking work, failure could come at various stages\u2014at launch, at release, during radio/attitude control testing, and at sail deployment. Or, we could just be delayed in our launch\u2014a day, a week or a month or more due to technical, weather or other scheduling issues. \n\nOne of the great storylines in the LightSail saga is the project rising from the ashes (or in this case, the waters) like the Phoenix of Greek mythology. The Planetary Society lost our first solar sailing prototype spacecraft, Cosmos 1, in June 2005 (almost exactly 10 years ago!) when the Russian Volna rocket that was lifting it into orbit failed and went off-course, landing somewhere in the Barents Sea. The Atlas V and SpaceX Falcon Heavy rockets promise more reliable rides to the stars, but things can always take a turn because, well, space is hard.\n\nThe Society will keep project backers informed about progress\u2014both accomplishments and challenges\u2014right here on our Kickstarter Updates page. Even better, we have dedicated reporter, Jason Davis, embedded with the project to really dig in on what's going on. His blogs are available at www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis and much more information is available on our dedicated micro-site, http://sail.planetary.org. Not only will you be monitoring our progress, but NASA and other researchers will, too! \n\nWhat's not at risk is the incredible opportunity that we have to experiment with solar sailing for CubeSats, to demonstrate the process of science, and to share the passion, beauty and joy of space exploration.

We've worked together in the visual arts for more than 20 years, as graphic designers, artists and 3D animators. We've also played Dungeons and Dragons (and other RPGs) together from an early age, starting with the red boxed Basic Set (oh, and even before that a game Dann made up and tried to make Greg play). \nThis project is a labour of love for us; to create imaginative, 3D-sculpted custom dice for our favourite hobby, and for the pure joy of holding and rolling them. We are very motivated to run this Kickstarter well and get the product into more hot little hands than our own. We'd love you to consider the pledge levels and rewards to the right, and if you'd like to order more than 4 sets, or for other details see the FAQ at the bottom of this page.\nWe needed your help to produce the Warrior Set! And not only have you helped us do that, thanks to your support and stretch goals we've already sized up the dice, added Knight Fight: A PolyHero Dice Game as an extra reward and unlocked Vorpal Purple and Amber and Steel Grey with Molten Copper dice sets! You've also helped us add a Grey and Copper Knight card to every copy of Knight Fight! Over the last few hours of the campaign only two potentially miraculous stretch goals remain unlocked, two more additions to Knight Fight: a set of multi-player battle-royale cards and rules ($88,000) and 6 new magic items ($99,000).\n Rolling Prototypes, Production Samples and What's Next...\nPLAY\n\nAre These Dice Balanced, Sir?\nWe've worked to make these dice balanced, through using lines of symmetry and weight and number distribution -- through testing in both computer simulations, with 3D printed prototypes, and samples of the final dice -- and they work very well. But we certainly don't claim they are as accurate as casino machined dice. If you want a guarantee of high precision and statistical clarity while you lop off a Troglodyte's head then these dice aren't for you. But if you just like fun and different dice for whatever reason, and don't care if you roll an extra 20 every 1,000 rolls then we'd love to raise a flagon together and share our dice with you. \nWhen we reached $40,000 it made it possible to \"chunkify\" the dice (for every set and with no cost to backers). We think it will make the dice look and feel even more impressive and Warrior like. Check out the end of the Rolling Prototypes, Production Samples and What's Next... video (higher up on this page), and Update 2 for more details. The below figures are a good guide, but we'll be printing new prototypes to get the feel of the larger dice in hand before locking in the percentage increase of each specific die.\nA PolyHero's Journey\nWhen I, Dann, first played Dungeons and Dragons I can remember the exact moment I learned that I needed to roll a certain one of these strange but cool dice to \"do damage\". I was in a class room at lunch time and I was examining the strange pyramid of the 4-sided dice, trying to work out how the numbers worked on it. As I rolled that \"d4\", I'm sure I can remember my 12 year old self imagining using the dagger that dice represented against whatever monster my friend had pitted against us. It may be a false memory, but I'm sure I remember part of me wanting the dice to more \"be\" the weapon in some way. But how could a dice also be a weapon...? (Well, I mean, besides just chucking it at someone)\n[Insert spooky video wipe]\n...to 30 years later and my team mate in the creative department at Game Salute, David MacKenzie dreams up and produces Rocket Dice for his excellent new edition of Alien Frontiers. Greg and I worked for David on the 3D sculpts for the dice, and as we were working on them David had the idea of doing an RPG set of Rocket dice. I suggested to him that maybe we do the higher number dice as flying saucers. The idea of saucers didn't \"take off\", but time passed and I got to thinking about custom dice in terms of my own love of RPGs, and soon dreamed up the idea for the 20-sided shield dice. I took the idea to Greg and we began working on the other designs.\nWe worked together on the designs and 3D modelling for almost a year in gaps between our regular work. Settling on the final designs was a bit of a journey. The first decision was to build a set themed around a Fighter. We had and still have other designs for other characters, but a Warrior just seemed like the best place to start. \nOne of the biggest decisions was whether to make the sword a d6 or a d8! In D&D long swords traditionally do d8 damage, short swords d6. What clinched it for us is that a d6 is a much more widely used dice and we felt like a sword would be a more iconic d6 for that reason. It would allow the possibility of people using handfuls of swords as their d6 in a variety of fantasy games, that seemed cool. Of course, it doesn't really matter, they are fun whether they exactly match the weapon you are using them for... but as you do, we wonder these things. And we can always do d8, or d10 swords in the future if things go well. (Plans for sets of d6s are on the cards, but not as part of the funding goal for this campaign, see the FAQ at the bottom of this page).\nIt actually took us the longest to come up with an idea for the d10 and d10 percentile dice. I'd started thinking about the dice in terms of a possible game, and the idea that the more faces a dice had the more defensive it would be, that all made sense, we had a shield and a helmet at the top of the scale and a dagger at the lower end. But what weapon would go in the middle...? Then somehow we got onto the idea of Gauntlets, which seemed to fit the bill as a transition between attack and defence, but also because there needed to be two of them... Coming up with the idea was the easy part in the end. Trying to arrive at a design for the d10 dice and modelling them in 3D took longer than any other design. We restarted multiple times on the design and ended up with more of a leather armoured glove look to the gauntlet. It's fun that we even have a right and left hand. We decided to use a simple dot beneath one of the number sets so they could together be used as percentile dice. Just think of it like a decimal point, or full stop.\nThe Production Process & Progress\nWe live south of Melbourne, in Australia, but thankfully Dann also works with Game Salute, who have been able to help us out with setting up this campaign, sourcing a manufacturer for the dice and seeing to their distribution internationally after the campaign completes. The plan is that after delivering to the backers, the dice could go on to be sold at retail in partnership with Game Salute.\nGame Salute's experience with the manufacturing of Rocket Dice taught the company a lot, and we've been able to benefit from that experience. We were adamant that the manufacturing process be bedded down before we went to Kickstarter, and Game Salute agreed, and agreed to foot the bill to guarantee it. They sourced a new manufacturer and went ahead and paid for a full production mould for some of the dice to be cut, so we could test the designs all the way through to a first round of production samples ahead of the campaign -- so that we anticipate no issues with the molding and manufacturing process.\nAfter the campaign we'll continue to refine up the finish of the dice, and implement a slight size increase (thanks to a stretch goal)... and then it's on into production. We'll update you as that progresses.\nFREE International Shipping! (Yes, that means Australia too!)\nBecause our dice are mercifully small compared to a big box board game, we can cover the shipping cost for you to locations all over the world! (using www.ShipNaked.com). \nStretch Goals and Extras?\nWe've unlocked a lot of stretch goals (see the introduction above)!\nBecause we have been so careful in testing the designs and the manufacturing process, we won't be adding new dice designs to this campaign. We'd absolutely love to do more dice design, and have some great ideas bubbling away, but that will happen as part of a new campaign if this campaign does well, with newly tested designs and due preparation on our part. (If you have ideas for the future leave them in the comments!!)\nWe don't want to add in extras like dice bags. As super-cool as they would be, there are lots of awesome dice bags out there and we would be honored if you chose to buy a special dice bag to hold your Poly Hero Dice, that would awesome!! But by us not offering that sort of thing here, we can concentrate on the task at hand and not end up with delays in our attempt to become dice bag creators and merchants. Maybe one day, maybe if this thing takes off we can offer custom PolyHero Dice bags, but not this day. The main concern for us is we deliver on time.\nKnight Fight\nAs part of the design process Dann created a dice game -- Knight Fight --- with a set of 18 cards to use with 2 sets of PolyHero Warrior dice! We're now making it part of the campaign! Check out the update.\nIf there are other game designers out there that feel inspired and work up games using PolyHero Dice, the easiest way to let us know is via the Submissions page at Gamesalute.com. We'd love to hear your ideas!\nCredits\nHere we go for the weird credits section where it's just us... but just so you can see the split of work...\nConcept and Design: Dann and Greg May\n3D Modelling and Animation: Greg May\nStoryboarding, Art Direction and Graphic Design: Dann May\nProducer: Dann May\nDann May is a visual artist and took on the role of Chief Creative Officer at Game Salute in January 2015. He has worked as an Art Director and Artist/Graphic Designer on games including Island Fortress, Chaos and Alchemy, King's Forge and the upcoming Legends of the American Frontier, Skyway Robbery, Area 1851 and Storm Hollow. \nGreg May is a professional 3D Animator and Modeller with over 15 years in the industry working on projects including children's television programs, medical animation and live event installations. He also freelances creating high end rendered images of board games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot about making custom dice through Game Salute's experience with creating Rocket Dice and watching other custom dice campaigns. These take a long time to make. We started this project about a year ago.\n\nWe know that it will take time to get these dice done right. That's why we've done all the 3D modelling up front and paid for a test mold with the factory producing the dice. We have gone to the extent of having actual samples in hand before the campaign begins to be sure that the designs didn't encounter in any issues during the moulding process. \n\nThat's also why we're keeping this campaign simple, with just two different colored sets. Game Salute learned that lesson from the ballooning of options with Rocket Dice and we're dedicated to keeping it simple for this one. If this campaign does well, we can always look at doing more options in the future, but we want to focus on delivering the first sets first.\n\nWe're being realistic by setting a year timeline for production and delivery. Of course we hope it takes less time and if it does Ship Naked will ship the dice out to all backers as soon as they have them.\n\nWe'll provide you with updates at each major milestone of production and delivery.\n\nWe love your comments and feedback. We'll provide any changes inspired by your feedback in our updates. If you've got a question or comment, whether it's in person, by phone, via email, or on this project page, we appreciate it.\n\nGame Salute have seen that sometimes, after a campaign successfully funds and the thing being funded is actually being produced, life happens and a few people will want to cancel their pledge before the estimated delivery date. If that happens, just contact us and we'll be happy to make arrangements to process a refund to you. Now take note: when we receive your funds, we only receive around 85% of what you paid thanks to various fees and charges, so whatever your pledge was you\u2019ll get it back less 15% to cover those charges. \n\nThanks for supporting us in making our idea for these dice a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Rogue Set on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Greetings Warriors!\nWe wanted to let you know that the Rogue Set is now live on Kickstarter!

You are a former officer of army of the Human Republic, forced to flee the death penalty because of the magic powers you have unwillingly developed. Being tracked down by humans and hunted by the monsters of the Wild, you are recruited by a mysterious group of Templars. And thus an epic adventure begins in which you will wander the world to fight inhuman, mutated monsters and discover the terrible secret of the extinguishing mankind.\nThe game features a unique mechanic called Apocalyptic Form that allows players to shape shift into a highly customized character! You\u2019re free to mold your character thanks to a deep and rich customization system. And thanks to our complex crafting mini-game and our housing module you will be able to make your adventure feel as YOUR adventure!\nUmbra aims to deliver many features that will differ from the classic games of the genre:\nOpen World : Discover the world and enjoy it at your own convenience\nExploration and experimentation is rewarded with new powers, attributed according to your play style!\nFree character development - No class limitation. You have three resources: Rage, Stamina and Mana, and they all interact with each other in order to balance gameplay.\nApocalyptic Form: According to your play style, you will develop special powers for your character, changing their abilities and look. Fierce melee warriors may gain a third arm to equip with a new weapon; a fire caster will have their skin turn into lava, healing from fire. Even wings and horns might appear depending on your actions!\nTons of Loot: Weapons, Armor, Potions and randomly generated magic effects for more gameplay diversity!\nSemi procedural Weaponry: Blades, pommel and guard details can be randomized for more unique gear in the game!\nAdvanced Crafting mini-game: Build your own weapons and armors thanks to a complex and challenging module in Umbra\nTons of Destructible environments: From small walls to complete parts of an area. We hope you enjoy it!\nHousing: Create your own house and proudly showcase your special gear!\nMature story full of secrets to discover exploring the world\nKythera AI system: The automatic real time navigation adaptation of Kythera adapts to any change in the physics of the world, allowing us to create exciting scenes including large portion of levels collapsing or moving and fighting on the back of giant creature, creating never seen before gameplay situations!\nDungeon challenge (Stretch goal): Transform a special part of your house into a dungeon and challenge other players to survive the onslaught!\nMultiplayer mode (stretch goal): Multiplayer is an ambitious goal we would love to achieve, but it must be done correctly. We plan to have different interesting stretch goals for you that will allow us to build the foundation of the multiplayer. In the best case scenario, we would like to have the following modes: Dungeon Challenge, Co-Op, and Competitive Plaver vs Player vs AI.\nA Different Hack & Slash\nThe scenario is an important part in Umbra, because understanding it will allow you to unlock secret areas with massive rewards. For example, helping an NPC who got lost in a hostile area may grant you with precious information about the game\u2019s story, and this may lead you to a hidden place full of treasure. If you just want to kill monsters you don\u2019t have to worry because you can focus on that. But Umbra will become even more interesting if you embrace the game\u2019s story!\nQuality of action, loot and personalization are keys for a good Hack & Slash game. By mixing these three elements, we designed the Apocalyptic Form feature, that will allow you to hand pick \u201cmutations\u201d for your character, such as wings or horns, and create a powerful war form for your character, affecting both your look and play style.\nWe are mixing the freedom of Skyrim, the action style of Diablo 3, the ambience of Diablo 1, the graphical power of Crysis, and adding our very own features on top of all that to come up with a unique and powerful gameplay!\nThe corrupted Human Republic is falling apart: Starvation and disease are ravaging mankind, leading to violent riots everywhere.\nIn order to maintain their grasp on the population, the Republic is using vicious tactics, poisoning the population to weaken it and removing all children from their parents to better mold their minds. Newborn babies are rare, and few are born healthy.\nAn unknown curse has made men lose their memory, provoking a limbo that has eaten their own history and technological knowledge.\nRumors say that the leaders of the Republic signed pacts with occult entities, and monstrously mutated humans are appearing in the wild, leading raids against cities and villages.\nFood became rare, leading to an extreme measure. In the name of survival, the Republic declared that anyone over the age of 50 should be killed. The same rule applies to anyone presenting mutation.\nThe Hero\nYou are a former officer of the Republic who developed magical powers. You tried to hide it, but your hierarchy found out. Instead of directly killing you, they tried to capture you and lead experiment on your body.\nYou managed to escape and take refuge in the wild. There, you were attacked by a large pack of the monstrous creatures. Outnumbered, you were about to fail when the mysterious order of the Templars saved you.\nWe want our quests to be memorable. We want you to fight on the back of giant walking creatures. We want you to defeat bosses that will collapse the ground under your feet.\nSecondary quest and random bounties will also be available and rewarding. They will usually be quick to execute, to make sure you can have fun if you don\u2019t have a lot of time to play.\nIf the funding follows, we would love to allow you to build your own dungeon using a system similar to our housing module, and challenge other players to defeat it. We already have the tech to do it... we only lack the budget to create more visual content.\nThe game will include a large open world featuring various environments, from swamp to mountains, to ancient ruined cities, forests and villages. If you want to spend a lot of time exploring the world and performing side quests, it is up to you.\nHumans populate most of the universe of Umbra. Other races exist, but are hiding because of the savagery of mankind. Most of the human population has actually forgotten about the existence of said races. Tales about dragons exist, but none have ever seen them in the flesh. The fact is that the Human Republic has conquered most of the known world and eradicated all of the potential concurrent living entities...\nThe CRYENGINE allows us to build a huge and beautiful world, full of dynamic vegetation. The game will feature a time of day mechanic that will influence gameplay as well. For example, some enemies will only appear during the day, others will try ambush you at night, and some secrets may only be revealed at a specific time!\nOpen World\nThere is a huge world to explore, and some areas of this outdoor environment will be randomized, so you will not see the exact same layout every time you start a new game.\nThe basic map size is of around 4 square km, and the world can be extended and grown if we reach specific stretch goals. The world will be alive and full of interesting locations to discover. And don\u2019t worry, this is a hostile world and enemies will be everywhere!\nIn addition to the huge map, players will be able to find several entrances to caves or ruined cities. These entrances will usually lead to a randomly generated dungeon, thus bringing more variety to the world each time you begin a new adventure.\nRandomly Generated Dungeons\nAs mentioned before, cave entrances in the open world or bounty quests will lead you into randomly generated dungeons. These levels not only look different during every game, but the game mechanisms inside these level may also vary during each run.\nRandomly generated dungeons are designed based on hand-made presets, with randomized elements thrown into the mix. We chose to do it that way in order to always control the render and the lighting of our scene because we want to exploit the rendering capabilities of the CRYENGINE as best as we can. For those who are interested in a more technical look at our Dungeon Generation technique, you can check some of our documentation about it at our DevBlog!\nFreedom of Development\nYou can build your character as you want, picking any skills, weapons or armors and making the combination of your choice. There is no class restriction. However, there is a price:\nResource Opposition System\nThe gameplay is balanced by three ressources:\nRage: Used for powerful melee attacks. You gain Rage by attacking enemies.\nStamina: Used for escape and assassin type skills. Stamina Regeneration is effective when your character doesn\u2019t take any damage.\nMana: Used for magic skills.\nAs stated above, Rage is gained by attacking enemies, but when you gain Rage, your Stamina and Mana will be reduced, and their regeneration rate will decrease. When you use Mana, your Rage bar will deplete faster.\nYou are responsible for your play style. If you keep attacking enemies with melee attacks, your Stamina will deplete, and you won\u2019t be able to cast an escape skill to avoid the deadly strikes from your enemies. It is up to you to balance your Build.\nOf course, there will be many ways to \u201chack\u201d the Resource Opposition System thanks to Active and Passive Skills or by carrying the right piece of equipment, so you\u2019ll definitely find a way to get things just right for your style.\nFire, Frost, Water and Lightning\nYou are free to use skills and spells as you want, but just like the Resource Opposition System, element-based spells will react to the environment and to other active elements in the area. For example, Lightning will spread in water and stun targets; Fire will spread unless water or frost gets in the way, ect...\nApocalyptic Form\nApocalyptic Form is a unique feature in Umbra making all players unique in their look and powers.\nWhile you are playing at a low level, all important actions of your character are recorded. Based on said data, we will generate specific powers for your character, called Apocalyptic Upgrades. At higher levels, every player\u2019s Apocalyptic Form should differ according to their story and play style!\nApocalyptic Form Concept\nHere are some example of Apocalyptic Upgrades:\nDemon wings: You can perform huge leaps and crush the enemies around you. You will also be able to access areas unreachable to other characters\nThird Arm: You have a third arm, and you can equip a new weapon for it.\nHorns: Run everywhere and rush into enemies to knock them down, crushing their faces while they are on the ground!\nBody of Fire: You won\u2019t take damage from fire anymore. Actually, fire will heal you. But beware of frost! You\u2019ll also leave a trail of fire on your path.\nBody of Shadows: You get a huge boost to your attack and movement speed and to your critical strike chance bonus while you are in a dark area. You also have a great dodge bonus.\nAura of Death: Undead raise everywhere you walk.\nHorrifying visage: Enemies have a chance to run away in fear when they see you.\nIncreased size: You are bigger. Your strength and Constitution get a huge percentage bonus.\nTornado: Reaching high speed will turn your body into a tornado, attracting every enemy around.\nOf course, there will be more powers to discover by yourself!\nAn Apocalyptic form is created with three of the available powers, but some items or passive skills may allow you to choose additional ones. Entering your apocalyptic form will grant several bonuses for a certain amount of time, but by combining Skills and Items, maybe some of you will find a way to make them last longer!\nActive Skills\nActive Skills are regular magic spells, assassin skills or special melee moves your character will use. They are usually paid with Rage, Stamina or Mana, but some can also be paid with Health Points or might simply have a long refresh countdown.\nActive Skills are found in the game by looting books. When you read a book, it is destroyed, and you gain a new skill. This skill will level up if you use it effectively against enemies.\nSkill Modifiers\nActive Skills can have their effects modified by special items in the game, usually with what we call Soul Gems. Soul Gems are socketable items with unique powers.\nThe effects of Skill Modifiers are different according to the targeted skill, but their effects are always powerful. A fireball will burn everything on its path, projectiles will bounce on enemies, and electricity-based skills may strike lightning everywhere in a large radius.\nThese Soul Gems will be numerous but will have a corresponding rarity, and they will be dropped by enemies according to your play style, so you will not find useless Modifiers for your build.\nPassive Skills\nPassive skills are a very important side of your character\u2019s development because each point you invest will drastically change you character\u2019s abilities. You will gain one passive Skill Point from each level up.\nPowers you may gain from the Passive Skill Trees can be very helpful and powerful. Some examples of the powers granted by Passive Skills are: \nAbility to have one Two-Handed weapon in each of your hands (because, why not?)\nAdditional Skill Slots on the Skill Bar\nIncrease the number of mercenaries following you\nStats increase\nArmor bonus from Health points (ideal for tanks)\nBonus damage against enemies in Fear\nCharacter Stats\nEach level, you will gain 5 points to invest in four different stats:\nStrength will increase your damage with melee weapons, how often your strike can stun enemies without using any special skills, and is also an important requirement to use the heaviest weapon and armors.\nDexterity will increase your chance to passively dodge enemy attacks or projectiles, how often you can perform critical hits, and increases your attack rate and movement speed.\nConstitution defines your resilience, increases your Health Points and Health Regeneration, passive Stamina recovery and resistance to various types of attacks.\nPower defines your ability to harness magic energy and it will increase the power of your magic spells and your Mana Points and Regeneration.\nCombining the effects of Stats, Passive Skills and Mutations will be a key element for your character\u2019s evolution. Combinations can be created to transform your character into a brutal force of destruction or to make him a vicious and elusive assassin!\nAllies\nMercenaries can follow you in your quest. By default, only one can follow you, but Passive Skills may increase that amount. You will be able to customize the armor and weaponry of mercenaries to complement your own powers!\nYou can also have an animal companion that will automatically sell your items in town, attack enemies and even immobilize some of them. If you feed them, they may start to dig for items, and they could even bring you great loot!\nUmbra WarDog - FREE Kickstarter Exclusive for Those at Wizard or Higher!\nZombie WarDog - FREE Kickstarter Exclusive for Those at Monk or Higher!\n   \"War Dog\" and \"Wolf\", exclusive animal companion skins for Kickstarter backers!\nFire Wolf Pet Skin - Kickstarter exclusive for those at BEAST TAMER TIER or higher!\nFrost Wolf - FREE Kickstarter Exclusive for Those at Duke or Higher!\nCreating Your Gear\nCrafting in Umbra is a unique mini-game designed to put you in the role of a smith. In order to forge a weapon or an armor, you will first need to gather all the requested ingredient. Once this is done, you will use them in the Forge Crafting module.\nThis mini-game is designed as a rhythm game simulating the hammer of a smith hitting the metal. Crafting can be frustrating because failing a recipe will destroy the ingredient, but it can also be very rewarding thanks to the customization and the possibility to hand-pick magical effects if your skill is good enough!\nA Stretch Goal we would love to achieve would be the ability to play the crafting module on your smartphone or tablet, and be able to bring your creations into the game!\nWeaponry System\nUmbra allows you to really personalize every detail of your weapons. Weapons are built from several elements. For example, a sword is usually built with a pommel, a blade and two guard elements. Each component of a sword has its own attribute, allowing a huge amount of different possibilities and optimizations.\nWeapon Stats\nWeapons in Umbra have a lot of different parameters. If you are a casual gamer, you may just care for damage and attack speed of your weapon, but the most hardcore one will love to check every stat our weapon system provides.\nEach of these stats will vary according to the weapon type and the crafted quality!\nAsymetric Armor System\nWe love asymmetric armor, and we want you to be able to customize your gear down to the finest details! You will be able to equip different shoulders and arm protection on the left and right side of your character, bringing a great number of personalization options!\nThese armors will be exclusive for Kickstarter backers! Check the Priest, Month and Duke tiers!\nSocketable Items\nSocketable items are precious stones or gems you can socket into your gear, upgrading each piece with new magical effects. There are three types of socketable items in Umbra:\nPrecious Stones: These items have predefined magical bonus.\nRare Jewels: These items have randomly generated bonus effects.\nSoul Gems: These are the most powerful gems, carrying unique and powerful powers, described in the \u201cUnique Items\u201d section below.\nUnique Items\nPotions are not items you can throw in Umbra. They are an important part of your build, just like a piece of armor or a weapon. Each potion can have various effects in addition to the classic Health / Resource recovery, such as a temporary attack or movement speed boost, invulnerability to elements, a search bonus, and so on. Potions can also be upgraded with Ingredients and special Recipes, granting them even more powers!\nVisual Design\nThe key idea behind the look design of our enemies is to make most of them look appear as tortured, mutated and dreadful humanoids. Terrible things have happened in the world of Umbra, turning normal people into inhuman and monstrous creature.\nEnemy sketches\nGameplay\nWe try to give every enemy its own set of powers. Each of one is supposed to challenge a side of your play style. Each one has advantages and weaknesses, and groups of enemies always feature a combination of various powers to make sure you face a a decent difficulty level.\nBosses are impressive, powerful, hard to kill entities, and they will always use the environment to challenge you.\nYou will be able to create your own house, build its walls and floor, add various kind of furniture, and showcase your best weapons and armor all over the place!\nSome achievements in the game will also allow you to unlock new furniture for your house to present your success to the world! Trophies and statues of your past victims can also be built if you have enough resources for it!\nMultiplayer is a very important aspect of Hack and Slash games, but also a complicated feature to setup because of the testing and balancing required.\nWe would love to develop a Multiplayer mode for Umbra, but we want to do it right, and that means additional development costs. For that reason, Multiplayer implementation is divided into different Stretch Goals:\nCreating a global leaderboard: All players will have to register on a server to be displayed in the leaderboard. It will allow us to develop ladders and cheat protection.\nHousing visit: Players will be able to visit each other\u2019s house. The most popular houses will be featured on our website!\nDungeon challenge: Things become serious here. You will be able to build a dungeon and challenge other players to defeat your setup. Tease them with precious items as reward for winners. And in order to participate, players need to pay in gold\u2026 and if they\u2019re defeated they will end up losing even more gold!\nCo-op: The classic Multiplayer mode!\nPlayers vs Players vs AI: A competitive multiplayer mode in which a group of players will have to complete a mission before an opposing team. And each team will have the ability to create traps or to use the roaming enemies to slow down the opposite team!\nWe want to self-publish the game, and we are asking for your help. In return, we want to build the game with the community.\nIn the following months after the Kickstarter campaign, we will release the prototype or Umbra (basic moves, spells, and gameplay will be implemented). It will be a glimpse into the future game. Most features are not implemented in this version, but you will be able to destroy enemies with powerful weapons and amazing magic effects. This will be available for those at the Wizard tier or higher. The prototype of the game will be limited to PC. \nThe Early Access will start with the Alpha release for backers at the Sorcerer Tier and at higher tiers. It will start with new content that will be the basis for the final game, including the beginning of the open world. This will be released to backers around November 2015!\nOnce that most features are implemented, and we consider we have a stable build, the Beta version will be launched for backers at the Apprentice Tier and at higher tiers.\nWe are using CryEngine EAAS\nAll key members of the team have years of experience working professionally with this engine.\nCRYENGINE offers us a great system for rendering, lighting, animation, particles effects and more. It allows us to forget about creation the technology for the game so that we focus on MAKING the game. \nThe amazing real-time environment we can create will allow us to present a beautiful world full of life and wonderful magic effects.\nIn real time, Kythera AI System adapts to every change in the world without any additional setup, allowing level designers to quickly test and reshape their work.\nThe amazing part of Kythera is that this system also works in the final game! So when a bridge explodes, AI will still find a way to come and beat you! It also means that scenes including moving platforms or walking on the back of giant creature without QTE is possible!\nWe are using the most cutting edge scan data available to create rich and high fidelity environments, with the help of early access to the Quixel Megascans library. It helps us as a small indie team to create really high quality graphics in a short amount of time, on par with AAA projects\nExocortex Species is a great tools for our character creation pipepline, allowing us to quiclky model and integrate new enemies in Umbra!\nSolarFall Games is a new indie studio born from the passion for creating the type of games we ourselves would love to play. All key members of the team have several years of experience working professionally with the CryEngine. That\u2019s how we met, and soon after we started to design Umbra during our free time. About a year ago, we left our jobs to focus our entire time on Umbra. \nWe are full indie. There are no publishers or private investors behind us. We had several possibilities to fund the game that way, but it would have meant losing control over our project and we decided we would prefer to remain 100% independent. So far, the game has been funded from our savings. \nReady to meet the team? \nPart-time staff members also works on the game: Alexandre Le Corre and Romain Pommier as Concept Artists, Jonathan Colin and Aurore Fiorini as Animators and Nathanael Fis as 3D Modeler\nUmbra\u2019s development started more than 4 years ago and hasn\u2019t stopped. It was originally supposed to be an open source RPG development platform for Crysis Modders, but was quickly oriented towards the Hack and Slash variety.\nFor Umbra on KS we joined forces with PR Hound, indie gaming gurus who have worked on several projects like MyDream, InSomia, Planets\u00b3, Animal Gods and Dungeons of Aledorn, to name a few. They know how to make the most out of what a Kickstarter campaign can offer and they definitely helped us us to get a ton of media coverage!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHack and Slash releases require a large amount of content and a high replayability value. We\u2019ve spent years on the game focusing on creating the right pipeline tools we could use to maximize our working time. All the team has great and valuable experience with the technology we are using, and we think it will minimize the risk involved in the development of our game.\n\nThe biggest risk we face is not being able to deliver the game on time. For that reason, we try to not make any crazy promises. Our Kickstarter is designed to build a solid game, and all stretch goals will contribute to making it better. We carefully picked the amount of money we need for a minimal team, and planned the potential extension of the team with the funds from stretch goals.\n\nWe do not have other financial backing, but this is a choice made in order to remain in full control of the game. We are confident in our game and are working hard to expand it and to make it even better. \n\nAs for Umbra itself, performance will be a very important focus for us. We have a good relationship with Crytek, and they love the fact that we are small indie team achieving great result with their engine. We know we can count on them for help for the optimization of our game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #122", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter pets and armors have been sent", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nAll the extra-keys have been sent to Adepts+ and Archbishop+ backers based on the email you provided in your surveys.

At the same time, it is our goal to make home security as easy and non-intrusive as possible.\nA self managing device: You no longer need to deal with alarm codes or constant monitoring. Flare takes care of everything on its own so that you can go back to enjoying your life.\nSmooth installation: Install Flare in under 10 minutes. Just attach it to the wall, download the BuddyGuard App and have your home secured. No expertise or technical assistance required.\nPower independent: Flare continues to operate on powerful lithium-ion batteries when electricity gets interrupted or cut off.\nData privacy: Your data is encrypted by the highest security standards as used by banks. On top of that, our camera gets mechanically covered when you or one of your trusted contacts arrive home.\nHassle free: Flare works entirely wirelessly, as it connects to the WiFi and even to cellular networks. Say goodbye to those annoying cables on the wall.\nPet friendly: Let your pets roam freely at home: You won\u2019t be bothered with notifications constantly.\nSmart control: Use your face, voice or the location of your smartphone to control Flare, for example to activate and deactivate the device\nYour home is your castle: It's where you feel safe and where you dare to dream. Home is where you always return to and where we share your thoughts and desires with those close to you.\nWhen someone has broken into your home, into your private atmosphere, it feels as if something irreplaceable has been taken away from you. Valuables are covered by insurances, damaged doors and windows can be repaired. But knowing that a stranger has forced his way into your home, might leave you feeling afraid and unsafe.\nHaving experienced this himself, our Founder Herbert Hellemann started developing a home security system himself, in 2014. Apart from having the vision of combining multiple advanced security technologies in a single device, Herbert made it the company's mission to create a system that is affordable, easy on the eyes and most of all: intelligent. Home security should not be a matter of contstant managing and monitoring: It should secure you and your home all by itself.\nFlare, the name of our device, is an easy to use home security system with a sleek design that looks right in every home. Forget about alarm codes, maintenance contracts or difficult installation: Flare is hassle free, low-maintenance and requires zero technical expertise.\nIt turns itself automatically on when you are leaving, but it does not watch you while you are home. Flare will notify you when someone it does not recognise enters your home, but when you don't have access to your smartphone or the internet, it can take intelligent actions on its own to protect your home. An intelligent action could be notifying other people you can trust, such as your partner or friends and family. If there is no speedy response, Flare will not hesitate to sound the alarm and notify the emergency services.\nNaturally, you can always add or delete friends, family, neighbours, your housekeeper or other people to your list of trusted contacts. Flare will authenticate this person as a welcome visitor, and then goes back to standby mode.\nComing home after a long day at work should be stress and hassle-free. With your mind still racing and your groceries in one hand and your keys and phone in the other, the last thing you want to do is dealing with security codes and all kinds of settings.\nFlare deactivates itself when you arrive home after picking up the signal of your smartphone and recognising your face. In case your phone ran out of batteries or if you simply don\u2019t have it with you, Flare will use face and voice recognition to authenticate your identity, before deactivating itself.\nFlare packs a wide array of cutting edge sensors and electronic components inside a very small enclosure:\nDiameter: 11 cm (4,33'')\nHeight: 2,5 cm (1'')\nWeight: 220g (7,7 oz)\nHD camera: A full HD 1080p camera is used to recognise your face and to record video and make snapshots in case of an event\nMotion detector: Spots movement in your home using infrared\nAccelerometer: Detects tampering with Flare, to avoid the device being taken off the wall\nTemperature sensor: Identifies sudden temperature changes in its environment\nMicrophone: Detects sounds associated with burglary and allows the user to give voice commands\nLoudspeaker: Emits home sounds like people talking or doing the dishes, so that the residents appear to be home\nSiren: Sounds the alarm when someone has invaded your home\nWiFi module: Keeps Flare connected to the BuddyGuard Cloud\nBluetooth LE: Enables Flare to communicate with your smartphone and with other smart home devices, without using your internet connection\n3G module: Takes over the connection to the Cloud in case the WiFi gets interrupted or cut off\nBatteries: Can power Flare completely or function as an electricity backup. Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.\nThere is a lot of physical parts inside Flare that help it make sense of its environment. Still, the thing that makes Flare very special is the way this information is used by the software. This allows it to be very intelligent. \nFace recognition: Flare can distinguish residents and trusted contacts from unfamiliar persons, by analysing and verifying the facial features of people entering your home.\nVoice recognition: By listening to your voice, Flare can authenticate your identity in order to take commands. For example, you can tell Flare to be more vigilant while you are on vacation.\nPrivacy control: Flare will only use the camera and microphone when there's a direct reason for it. Upon positive face recognition, the camera will be mechanically closed and the microphone gets turned off.\nLocation: By using the geolocation of your cellphone, Flare knows when you have left your home. From that moment on until it sees you again, the system will be fully active and extra alert to protect your home\nPet friendly: Flare can tell the difference between an innocent pet and someone who should not be there, as shapes and motions are verified to belong to an animal.\nScheduling: Inform Flare by voice command or app that you will be away for a few nights or even a long vacation, to make sure the system stays alert and activated at all times.\nFlare is an entire system. The advanced hardware and software work together in harmony to guarantee that it can act on your behalf.\nOur highly secured, continuous exchange of information between Flare, the BuddyGuard Cloud and the App ensure a home security system that stays intelligent by recognising faces, voices and patterns \u2013 so that it can always take smart actions to protect you and your home.\nFlare is meant to keep unwanted visitors at bay, but the people close to you should always be able to visit you - even when you are not at home. From your family to your best friends, the friendly neighbour across the street and your cleaning help \u2013 you can add them all to your Security Circle.\nNew members can be added to the system through the app or the browser based dashboard. After entering their name, Circle level and access rights, you will then introduce the new member to Flare by asking the person to face the device. Flare will take a couple of snapshots, in order to use face recognition the next time they visit. By saying out loud a specific sentence as shown in the app or dashboard, Flare will be able to recognise the voice of the new member.\nWe recommend every member to download our app, as geolocation will then be used as the first authentication step, making the process a lot faster and easier.\n BuddyGuard's Flare can be installed within minutes. Just follow these simple instructions:\nAttach the magnet holder with adhesive tape to your wall and place the device on top of the holder\nTurn Flare on by pushing the single button it has. This makes it automatically search for wireless networks nearby\nDownload the BuddyGuard App from the Apple Store or from Google Play. Open it and enter your WiFi password\nTake a few pictures of yourself and talk to the App for the system to train itself and be able to recognise your face and voice in the future\nThat's it!\nFlare's batteries are designed to last 3 weeks under normal operating conditions. Whenever Flare is running out of battery it will inform you through the App. In that case, just take Flare from the holder and charge it like you would your smartphone, using the micro USB port. Leave it charging overnight and place it back before you go out. If you prefer, you can always choose to leave Flare connected to the electricity using the provided micro USB Cable. This is very useful, for example, when you go on a long vacation.\n Some apartments are well-protected with a single Flare, whereas multiple level houses will benefit from installing three or four Flares. It really depends on the layout of your home. You can place as many Flares as you need, since they can all communicate to the BuddyGuard Cloud, using your WiFi and Bluetooth LE. In case of an interruption of your internet connection, each Flare will submit and receive data by using the 3G connection.\nThrough the App or the browser based Dashboard, you will be able to configure different settings for each Flare. This way, you are always in control.\nBuddyGuard uses the power of IFTTT to extend the functionalities of Flare. IFTTT allows you to communicate with other Apps and devices to create simple action-reaction rules. You could, for example, trigger your Philips Hue lights to turn green when you arrive home when the system has recognised you.\nDailyMail: \"Home security just got personal: Flare recognises faces and fools burglars by playing the sound of dishes being washed.\"\nCNET: \"Flare can tell the difference between you and an intruder and will automatically turn its camera and microphone off if it recognizes your face.\"\nGizmag: \"It's a device packed with clever ideas.

This means that you won\u2019t have to deal with entering security codes anymore. Flare recognises your face and then goes into standby mode.\nFace recognition\nBy analysing and verifying the biometric features of faces, Flare's artificial intelligence can distinguish residents and trusted contacts from unfamiliar people.\nVoice recognition\nWhile unfamiliar voices are a reason for Flare to raise its vigilance, authenticated voices from residents and trusted contacts can control and inform the system.\nLocation detection\nBy analysing the location of your phone, Flare can deactivate the system and cover the camera just as you are arriving home. This way, you never have to loose a second taking an action for yourself. Also, you will never feel observed.\n Pet detection\nThe artificial intelligence, powered by the BuddyGuard Cloud, just got a whole lot smarter! Flare can now distinguish shapes, objects and: Pets!\nThis way, your four-legged friends can roam freely in your apartment, without raising Flare's alertness levels.\nAlthough Flare will do its very best to keep intruders at bay, there is still a chance that someone will enter your home. Apart from sounding the alarm, Flare will video record and snapshot everything within its sight, while sending push notifications to your smartphone. Flare will also notify the emergency services of your city on your behalf. All video and photo material will be saved, encrypted, in the BuddyGuard Cloud, for future reference.\nYour pledge means so much more than just money. We have a functional prototype, but the development of Flare is not finished. We still need to tweak our design to be able to fit it in the beautiful form factor you see. With your support, we can produce and ship an amazing home security system.\nHearing from you means the world to us: It will help us to create a sophisticated device that can think and act on its own, to ensure optimal protection of you and your home.

We can re-invent everything right now!\nWhat's Makey Makey GO?\nMakey Makey GO is the World\u2019s First Invention Kit that goes with you everywhere. Makey Makey GO catalyzes the same creativity and ingenuity in creators as the original, award-winning Makey Makey Classic and gives today\u2019s tinkerers, dreamers, and makers even more mobility\u2014allowing them to invent anytime, anywhere.\nMakey Makey GO connecting a banana to laptop. While the look and feel is as simple as peeling a banana, the intricate sensors and circuitry were engineered by PhDs from MIT.\nSmall enough to fit on your keychain, book bag, or bracelet, Makey Makey GO turns everyday objects into touchpads and combines them with the internet. It\u2019s a simple tool-slash-toy that allows beginners and experts to make countless art, music, engineering, and science projects. It comes ready to use out of the box with no setup and no installations. Just plug and play.\nYou Can Wear It or Attach it to Your Stuff\nMake + Key + On the GO = Makey Makey GO!\nBy practicing inventing everywhere with Makey Makey GO you start to gain invention literacy\u2014you become able to \"read\" inventions (understand others' inventions), and you become able to \"write\" inventions (make your own inventions). As with ordinary reading and writing, invention literacy is invaluable even if you never become a professional inventor.\nWhat Can I Make?\nThat\u2019s up to you! The main thing is that Makey Makey GO turns the world into a giant construction kit\u2014because world-changing ideas don\u2019t always happen in a lab or at school. Sometimes they happen in the shower, on the playground, flying a kite, or sitting under an apple tree.\nDonut Spacebar\nIn a Text Editor, Makey Makey GO pushes \"space\" every time you touch the donut\nSlackline Score Keeper\nThe score goes up the longer you stay on the Slackline\nDog-o-Phone\nWhen Puppy touches the foil heart, Skype calls his people so he can say \"Wooof!\"\nSlip'n Selfie\nA High-Five triggers a selfie photo on a tablet as you launch off the ramp into the water\nPlant Harp\nMake a Harp from Palm Fronds, Cardboard and Thumbtacks. Strum the plant harp to trigger sounds and visuals on the laptop.\nFlappy Jello\nGive new meaning to \"Play with your Food.\" Grab some jello out of the fridge, and grab your Makey Makey GO off the fridge door (it's a magnet!). Play a video game by slapping jello.\nHow Does Makey Makey GO Work?\nPlug Makey Makey GO into the USB port of your laptop and then Alligator Clip an object to the Makey Makey GO board. For example, a banana. When you touch the banana the Makey Makey GO sends the computer a keyboard or mouse message. The computer just thinks Makey Makey GO is a regular keyboard or mouse. Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.\nWhat Objects Does it Work With?\nMost materials that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Here are some materials people have used in our workshops: Leaves, aluminum foil, cars, running garden hose, silverware, milk, wet things, alive things, metallic things, graphite, play dough, kitchen sinks, etc. If something won't work, you can make it work for example by applying copper tape or getting them wet.\nFruits, Snacks, Humans, Animals, Cars, Swimming Pools, Coins, and Your Grandma, and Thousands More\nWhat Apps/Webpages Does it Work With?\nIt literally works with any app and any webpage that use a mouse or a keyboard press, which is almost every app or webpage a laptop can run. it just presses keyboard buttons and clicks the mouse. You might try a one button game website, or a music website such as TouchPianist. Use Photobooth or an online webcam program to trigger selfies, and use Powerpoint to advance slides. Launch Skype or FaceTime and hover the mouse arrow over the \"call\" button. Cue up a video on YouTube and trigger it to play with the spacebar or the mouse click. Or use one of the many custom Apps that we have created for you. There are countless possibilities.\nWho is Makey Makey GO For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers, Special Needs Children, Tinkerers, Creators, Dreamers\u2026 Really it is for everyone.\nAge 6 to 101, Kids and Teens Love Makey Makey, but so do Hobbyists and Experts\nWhile Makey Makey GO is playful and easy to use, it packs a lot of power and has a sleek technical design that geeks love.\nRequirements?\nMakey Makey GO works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 & 8, and Mac OSX. It also works with some tablets and mobile devices.\nMakey Makey GO Plugged into a MacBook Pro. By hooking up the traditional pinball machine button to the Makey Makey GO you can play two pinball games at once.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Windows Surface tablet running Windows 8. The score counts how long the person has stayed on the slackline.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Samsung Galaxy running Android using a USB adapter. Cardboard SmartSword is made with a Smartphone, some aluminum foil, and Makey Makey GO.

We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits.\nWe redesigned Makey Makey Classic to focus it down to its absolute bare essentials: a single capacitive sensor input with a single alligator clip that can pretend to be any key or a mouse click. Then we gave it a magnet, a keyring, and shrunk it down so small that it fits anywhere. The result is something that can always GO with you and that is unbelievably simple to use. It's the size of a USB thumb drive and just as easy to plug and play. \nWe designed Makey Makey GO to feel more like a kitchen gadget or a multi-tool and less like a traditional circuit.\nMakey Makey GO stuck to a fridge door magnetically is just one example of how Makey Makey GO is always within grasp.\nMakey Makey Classic \nIn 2012 we created, Kickstarted and delivered (early) the original Makey Makey, and it was named Best of Kickstarter. It has now gone into the hands of 200,000 inventors and delighted millions of others.\nMakey Makey Awards and Press\nThe Makey Makey Classic was named one of Consumer Reports\u2019 \u201cBest Tech Toys of 2014\u201d and one of Popular Science's \u201cBest of Toy Fair (2014).\u201d In addition, Makey Makey Classic was recently inducted into the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s (MoMA) permanent collection.\nTED Talk on Makey Makey \n\"I used to want to design a utopic society, or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm getting older I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be 7 billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic, coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's a world I really want to live in.\"\nWho are we?\nTodd Eddie, Jay Silver, David ten Have, and Rachel Silver.\nJay Silver leads JoyLabz and recently came out of MIT Media Lab and Intel. Dave ten Have, COO, co-founded the first cloud 3D printing company, Ponoko, and is an awesome Hacker. Todd Eddie, our VP, is a climber, and he's a Georgia Tech electrical engineer. Rachel Silver, our Logistics Goddess, studied visual arts at Sarah Lawrence and Reed College and is a gardening guru. Liam Nilsen, who is a lifelong unschooler, joined most recently to handle social media \u2014 he also runs the Endor project. \nWe all collaborated from across the globe to bring Makey Makey GO into existence. As Dave said the day before launching the Kickstarter, \"I think I just realized that I am living in the future. I live in New Zealand, but here I am in Cocoa Beach riding an electric bamboo/carbon-fiber bike, made by a friend out of local bamboo and left over carbon fiber, to UPS to overnight prototypes of an invention kit the size of my thumb that didn't even exist until 2 weeks ago to people all over the world. I am my childhood self's superhero.\"\nSo many people contributed to Makey Makey GO that they can't all be listed here. Please see the about page for credits. Eric Rosenbaum co-invented Makey Makey Classic with Jay. Makey Makey would not be possible without the input of literally thousands of people.

The unassuming hoodie drawstrings that dangle down in front of the wearer are actually the straws from which your liquid is dispensed!

Our family had just grown from four to six and our income dramatically shrank. I had been working as a carpenter and Christine in the fine dining business. Both of our occupations were hit hard by the recession. We needed to find a way to reduce our dependency on these industries and become more self reliant. \nWe wanted to do something we could enjoy together as a family. I have a love for the outdoors and being on the water, Christine loves fine dining and yes the kids all love ice cream. So why not create a gourmet ice cream boat. At first our energy and resources went to keeping our family afloat. I spent considerable time researching the ins and outs of licencing and running an ice cream boat. Over time we collected materials we later used to build the Monkey Boat. Finally by the spring of 2014 we were ready. After a few last minute registration issues we got her in the water. \nWe quickly saw a huge positive response to our presence on the lake. People began to wave us over to their docks, boaters chased us down and formed \"drive through lanes\" and the sand bar was crazy! Customers  came swimming, floating, and paddling over with money in plastic bottles, bags and even in their teeth. Unfortunately the summer ended early for us. Our engine quit one day and we were never able to get her going again. While we were in operation we learned a lot! We saw what works and what doesn't work. \nWe are eager to begin our second season, but need a little help from our friends. The help is needed in three main areas. First we need to repair our out board, a dependable engine is critical to our success. Second we need to power our equipment with a dependable super quiet generator. Finally with several upgrades and additions to our kitchen equipment we will have the ability operate on a more professional level. Once our funding goals have been reached I am confident the Monkey Boat can generate considerable revenue during the course of this summer season. \nWe plan to continue and expand our \"dipping\" menu witch was very popular. We will offer frozen bananas, frozen cheese cake and a vanilla ice cream bar all on popsicle sticks. We dip them in chocolate and add toppings to order. We will scoop ice cream and serve it in our home made waffle cones and bowels. We will also add fresh fruit smoothies to our popular ice cream soda / drink menu. Finally we will add sandwich specials such as a caprese sandwich, lobster roll, and a wedge salad made with home made candied bacon and pickled onions. \nGetting this project off the ground and back in the water will allow our family some financial freedom and independence.

We will provide the convenience of being mobile, the satisfaction of supporting community, all with approachable, comforting, and familiar flavors. Every sandwich is crafted around our fresh, artisan soft pretzel bun. The same time and care that we put into our sandwich foundation will continue with all of the dressings, roasted meats and non meats alike, and all of the fixings. Seattle needs a sandwich trailer that will highlight the start to finish philosophy that so many of our local restaurants practice. \nAnchor End\u2019s number one priority will always be the customer and their need for a quality product at a reasonable price. The Seattle residents need the convenience of a mobile cafe and sandwich shop to serve delicious, quick, and thoughtful food from morning until late afternoon. This new mobile food business will be started and fully ran by the partnership under twin sisters Amanda Lewis and Jessica Lewis. Both of us will have equal say and shared goals for the overall well being of Anchor End. The focal point of all products starts with our pretzel rolls. Our pretzels are made daily from the production of the dough, to the roll\u2019s shaping, and to the final baking. There is a variety of different dough from which each pretzel sandwich is built upon. These flavors are paired with house-roasted meats, house made condiments, and the freshest of local produce. In addition to our sandwiches, we will also be serving Dirty chips, Shasta and San Pellegrino sodas, and Lighthouse drip coffee.\nFrench toast pretzels. Come on.\n Anchor End will be ran out of a sixteen foot 1969 Shasta 16SC camper trailer. The trailer is currently being converted and L&I approved at Seattle Food Truck Builders in Auburn, Washington. To do the preparation requirements in the space needed, we will be leasing a kitchen space from Special Occasions Catering located in North Seattle. It will be at this location where we will be prepping and cooking the majority of our products before service hours. In addition to serving curbside and at farmers markets, leasing a kitchen will allow us to cater events such as weddings, birthdays, and other parties. Through Anchor End catering, we will be able to provide other services including dessert tables and custom cakes.\nWith the recent incline in popularity of mobile food all over the country; but specifically even more so in the Pacific Northwest, the existing food truck customer base will be eager for our new idea. Not only will these current mobile food customers be part of our market, but also residents who are seeking a fast, fresh, and quality meal will gravitate toward our menu. Anchor End not only provides for people looking for convenience, but also for those who desire vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options. What seems to be lacking and missing a potential customer base in our great city is the availability of a quick and satisfying breakfast. Anchor End will start the day by providing the same thoughtful approach to breakfast sandwiches while continuing on to the mid to later day crowd with lunch.\nHomemade gluten free bun with veggie patty\nOur \"Beefcake\" (Steak Sandwich)\n Anchor End is a fun and unique answer to not only a small restaurant, but also to the typical mobile food trucks that are currently around all of Seattle. We will run our business out of a custom retro travel trailer that will be pulled by a truck to every service location. Our look will easily become memorable and help establish our brand. Once our customers see passed our creative exterior, they will find that what also makes Anchor End pleasantly different is our fresh approach to all of the food that we serve. As owners, we strongly believe and practice the process of producing our sandwiches completely from start to finish. We make our pretzel buns and condiments, roast our meats, use local produce, and support our city\u2019s small businesses by selling local coffee drinks. Anchor End shows an edge with our flavor profiles and commitment to producing darn tasty soft pretzel sandwiches!  Compared to Downtown, West, and South Seattle, North Seattle is in need for more mobile food options. With our comforting and thoughtful sandwiches, we will, without a doubt, make a splash in the food world.

Weather can definitely be unpredictable and quickly change your plans. Our custom service window will be cut in order to double as an awning. This covered space won't stop the rain, but it will sure keep more people dry!\nAnother obstacle can be getting permits for parking. Our plan is to secure specific spots each day of the week so that won't be as much of an issue. A lot of these spots have been chosen on private property so we would have the permission of the owner. We will have a catering license as well, so this will help us with other necessary paperwork or permits.\nA common problem is mechanical. Trucks break down all the time and lose precious street time while the truck is in the shop. While still in the planning stages of Anchor End, we decided to go with a tow trailer to avoid this issue. Our thought was that if we have mechanical issues with our vehicle pulling the trailer, we can easily use a different vehicle and not lose business.\nBeing L&I approved would also be difficult if you're not experienced with code, so that's why we selected a professional food truck builder to avoid any unexpected changes with the interior being up to code.\nWe are one hundred percent committed to figuring out any challenges that might arise and we will be very flexible after we get funded.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Amanda and Jessica Lewis (deleted)\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nAnchor End Pretzel Shoppe was thought up almost five years ago.

We also want to unleash Burrasca's full potential, allowing Paolo the scope to expand his seasonal menu and bring something truly unique to the collective Portland table.\nYour pledges will help with all the start-up costs associated with getting the restaurant of our dreams off the ground. We're searching for the perfect home for Burrasca, and when we find it, WITH YOUR HELP, we'll be in a position to dive right in, roll up our sleeves, and start slinging some of the best darn Florentine eats west of the Arno.\nWe're on a shoestring budget and we've got most of the start-up costs covered, however we're asking you to help us raise $12,000 so we can meet our deficit in the expenses associated with equipment, furnishing & fixtures, and initial inventory. Know that we're so very grateful for whatever you can manage or care to give, and we thank you advance for your generosity and good will. Grazie mille!!!\nHow did Burrasca come to be, you ask? Well, once upon a time, in a ramshackle vineyard far, far away....\nDOWN AND OUT IN FLORENCE, ITALY\nPaolo and I had been living over a decade in the Renaissance capital--his hometown--when it began to feel like a dead end. Paolo's long-held desire to own a restaurant serving the food he grew up eating and felt so passionately about was burning to materialize. We wanted to come back to the States and make it happen but with two children and all the immigration and family issues it was a daunting task, indeed. Nevertheless, we laid our plans, sold our house, barely escaped Italian bureaucracy with our lives (icing on the cake: we were gassed and robbed by thieves in our home on the eve of departure), and in late June 2013 landed in Portland--a city we fell in love with and continue to adore. We were excited about making a new life.\nA FOOD CART IS BORN\nIt made sense to start with a food cart: we could test the waters while hopefully building a following of loyal fans who'd eagerly dine at the restaurant we hoped to one day open. It was a great opportunity to interact directly with customers, creating an immediate and satisfying connection; Paolo came home every night exhausted but fulfilled.\nFood Cart of the Year 2014 - Willamette Week\nBurrasca the food cart achieved more than we could've hoped for. We got a lot of great press, we'd often sell out, and, most importantly, people seemed genuinely happy to eat whatever Paolo put in front of them, gallantly trying things--like our squid inzimino--that many had never even heard of. The cart's success and the warm welcome and enthusiasm with which Portlanders embraced Paolo's fiercely regional cooking touched us deeply and reinforced our goals of one day getting a restaurant off the ground. \nour gnudi, tortelli, inzimino, cartmade pasta & pappa al pomodoro\nREADY TO MAKE THE LEAP\nIn January of this year we closed the cart in order to focus on our dream of going brick and mortar; we've been actively searching for a space that's right for us and feel we're getting close to finding one. With the help of your pledges, we aim to defray certain startup costs and create a casual, lively, warm and welcoming place where Paolo can dish up his native version of comfort food.\nWHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?\n$3000 - Kitchen equipment such as deep fryer, food warmer, etc.\n$4000 - Inventory (food & beverage)\n$400 - Smallwares (dishes, glassware, silverware)\n$4600 - Tables, chairs, lighting, decor (including DIY supplies), signage \nWe're budgeting for a pretty bare-bones start-up; anything extra we raise beyond the minimum $12,000 will reimburse Kickstarter's fees and allow us to refine and upgrade certain fixtures and furnishings into the fabulous restaurant space we envision.\nWHO ARE WE?\nThe four of us--including our son Giacomo and daughter Gemma--are a family who loves to laugh, travel together and explore new places and cuisines, while striving to enjoy life and stay conscious of what's truly important. We've never chased material wealth, but prefer to pursue richness of experience: spending time with friends and loved ones, learning all we can about this incredible world, enjoying nature, savoring simple pleasures. We embrace change and have thus embraced our new life--and the launching of what we hope will become a full-fledged family business--in glorious Portland.\nTogether, Paolo and I have some 45 years' worth of experience in the restaurant biz. Fittingly enough, we met at an Italian restaurant not long after we both moved to San Francisco in the early 90s.\nCheck out the Burrasca website for more on who we are and what we do!\nFROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS\nPortland, you have been SO good to us, so very supportive and kind--as have our visitors and well-wishers from as far away as Italy. Since we opened our food cart, your appetite, enthusiasm, adventurousness and appreciation has touched us deeply. We are already so grateful. \nAs we appeal to your generosity with this campaign, know that any kind of support or pledge is deeply appreciated.

We are CT Provisions! Or we will be soon - with your help and support . For more than 20 years we have honed our culinary craft in many respected restaurants in New York, San Francisco, and Hartford, CT. As an integral part of the culinary management team at the award-winning Firebox Restaurant in Hartford, CT, we have earned a reputation as leaders in Connecticut's farm-to-table community and have developed strong relationships with many local small farmers in our region. Now we plan to take our passion for local, sustainable ingredients on the road. Please help us launch CT Provisions so we can bring the best locally-sourced, innovative cuisine to the streets of Hartford, and beyond!\n THE FOOD... Provisions, Summer 2015\n4 Mile River Farm Smashed Burger - Red torpedo onion jam, Melville cheese, truck ketchup, pickled mustard seeds, duckfat griddled ciabatta roll \nMarwin Farm Duck Carnitas - kolhrabi kimchi, crispy shiitake bacon, avocado crema, pita bread\nCT Bluepoint Oyster Po Boy - pickled peppers, Starlight Garden greens, green zebra tomatoes, old bay aioli, baguette\nFarmer's Market Heirlooms - Cherokee purple, brandywine,  & yellow boy tomatoes, lemon & kirby cucumbers, Mexican sour gherkins, local feta cheese, salsa verde\nTempura Squash Blossoms - Sweet Pea Farm feta cheese, local honey, basil\nKale & Quinoa Salad - Starlight Garden kale, toasty quinoa, roasted corn, slow poached farm egg, potato sticks, sungold tomato vinaigrette\nSummer Corn Corn Chowder - garden herb-pesto\nFried Pie - Rose's Berry Farm fresh blueberries, creme fraiche, shitload of powdered sugar\nOur Menu will aggressively change according to the seasons and availability!

Even though food truck startup costs are lower than traditional brick and mortar restaurants, they are still significant. We need to invest in insurance coverage, website and logo design, permits and licensing fees, point of sales system, commercial kitchen rental, and accounting and attorney fees. Plus our biggest ticket item, the food truck itself! So we've created this Kickstarter project to get things going.\nWe've spent months researching the ins and outs of the food truck industry and have worked closely with the Connecticut Small Business Administration to formulate our business plan. Our food truck is the heart and soul of our business and is the most important decision we weill make. We have two options.\n\nOption 1: Purchase an existing equipped food truck. This will be less expensive, but creates a greater risk with equipment and mechanical failures. Used food trucks generally do not come with a warranty on kitchen equipment, truck engines, or generators. A quality used food truck can run from $40k-$50k. \n\nOption 2: Food Truck Builder. We have four quotes from reputable food truck builders with prices ranging from $53k-$70k. Custom building the CT Provisions food truck will not only give us the luxury of designing our kitchen from the ground up, it will also come with a warranty on all kitchen equipment and engine related issues.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS !!!\n\nDavid Zemelskey - Starlight Gardens Farm - Durham CT\nwww.starlightgardensct.com 2015 CSA Shares available!\n\nKen Dahill - Marwin Farm - New Hartford, CT \nwww.marwinfarm.com Their Ducks are Amazing! \n\nLove our logo?

This is one of those stories. The place is Providence, Rhode Island, the time the late 1980's. As the city was opening up the river and revitalizing the downtown. Chance meeting of three young guys who's interests all included cars, art, and beer...I know, big surprise.\nEach of us builds things. We have in the past built all kinds of things like racecars, airports and shopping malls. We build important things like high tech helmets for our Special Forces troops and ballistic eye protection. We build beautiful things like homes and environments. We make art that grace the walls of private, public and corporate collections. We have raised the bar, and had the rules changed in places and times when the box was left open enough for us to shine above everybody else. Our work has been on TV and in movies and won national awards. Some has been top secret (Shhh) and others that nobody notices. Our work has enhanced lives, made things run smoother, sold products and most important our work has made people smile.\nDown East Lobstah's Mmmm tasty!\nThree years ago at Joe's annual clambake that happens at anniversary time (You should see this clambake setup) Joe brings out moonshine Mmmm, Moonshine! \"Thinking of opening a business,\u201d he says. \"Need a change,\u201d he says.\nSo I waited, waited because I had been making beer and mead for years. Ready to help, but not wanting to take a friends idea. I was hoping he would want my help. But nothing happened.\n\"When?\" I asked,\n\"Not now\" he says.\n\"Now?\"\n\"Well, I am busy again\"\n\"Well if you don't, and I start looking into it, you know what will happen.\" \"Yep, sure do\" he says. So one-day month or so later I did. Opened up the computer Googled distilling and stared my education, It was time for my change. Sipping everything I can get my hands on helps too and leads to some interesting conversations. Distilling for grins and giggles is different than doing it at an industrial level. All three of us have had very successful businesses.\nAll three of us have faced the changes that the recession has brought. Our hand crafted, one of a kinds eye on the detail kind of work has gone out of style. Our work has been replaced with cheaper and faster to make products. There is always somebody willing to do it cheaper. In the craft spirits industry, the opposite is true, there we can ply our art and craft and make something memorable and people are willing to spend more on it.\nclambake shine\nWe will be starting a small craft distillery. Small as in all done by hand, every batch the result of boiling batches of grain the old fashioned way. Andy working on making the distillery runs smoothly. Joe's creative genius making sure I haven't forgotten anything and to keep an eye on the numbers for those long-term goals. Sarah is doing the sales. John is doing the distilling. Pam, fearless graphic designer has a team of the most creative people working under her for our design and sales needs.  \nWe will make is a selection of aged and un-aged products, vodka, OOhh I make a great neutral spirit. rum-mmm, and I have a GREAT spiced rum, with a long familiar, but different finish. Wait till you try it, it will keep you warm at night! Whiskey single malt, aged and full of flavor, good for sipping neat. And of course some 'shine to come first out of our distillery. It will take a full 2 years to get our bourbon to find its way into bottles and into a glass, and when it does, you will be the first invited to enjoy it with us.\nAnd the Money is for\nBuilding. Of course over a third is to build the rewards we said we would create. $1,500 goes to Kickstarter for their service. Rewards will be about a third to build and get them to you $7000. $11,000 will be used to purchase parts, and distilling equipment. Mash cooker, fermenters, water heater, and cooler and a small experimental recipe still. No Vendome still for this group, way too inside the box. If we go over, and I hope we do, we will work at our energy conservation. Each little bit of energy we save, is energy we don't have to pay for. We will use lots of heating and cooling, and are hoping to recycle our waste heat, but that is a challenge. Self-sufficiency is part of the New Hampshire ethos, but it is a tough nut to crack with as much energy as it takes to run a distillery. \nA first version of a business plan is complete. It looks extremely promising with the low NH tax, (relative to the rest of the country). The customer base, are big drinkers (highest in the nation). The trending of the market all lead to a favorable marketplace. We need to attract a group of investors who have a similar desire to create and bring to market a line of spirits that profile the best of New Hampshire and New England. \nRewards\nRewards Will be so much fun! I can't wait. We will work (work is a strong word here) hard at creating a set of great cocktail recipes for your cocktail party. Each recipe using our unique and distinctive liquor, and each cocktail recipe will have its own full color recipe card. Each of these recipes will have a fun name from one of our Kickstarter supporters. A collection of 25 different recipe cards will be created. From these recipe cards, we will create a volume, bound together to use at your bar. We will create 50 of these signed and numbered as a limited edition for the first 50 who select that pledge. Other pledges will have collections of the recipe cards.  \nThe Name Game\nHere is a card to make s Sassy Sarah Smith. Of course the names of our drinks or liquors haven't been confirmed, but the drink is yummy especially if you have some wild Main Blueberries. Drink one of these and you'll be sassy too!\nCocktail Recipe Card\nName a bottle, name a batch!\nIts your bottle, go ahead, put your name on every bottle from one batch from the distillery. Each bottle is hand numbered with a batch and bottle, there is no regulation that says it can't be your name! So go ahead, and name it, make it yours. We will send you a bottle; sadly it has to be empty, Kickstarter rules.\nOR how about placing your name on our Kickstarter Thank You Plaque. Immortalized in our tasting room for all to see. Of course it might just be more fun to see your name on one of our drinks, no, make that YOUR drink.\nArt Don't Mind\nOur labels displayed as wall art framed and ready to hang. Once approved by the Govt. we will make a fine art print of one of the label designs, signed, numbered and matted. You won't find anything like it anywhere.    \nThe Hand Crafted\nWrite it down, least you forget with a whiskey bottle inspired Pen made from locally sourced Maple and Toasted Maple. Liz hand turns these pens just for us and inspired by the neck and finish of a whiskey bottle. We will create one just for you, available in a variety of finishes, styles and woods. Hoping to add an Oak bourbon barrel wood to the mix.\nWhisky inspired hand crafted Maple pens\nMy guess is you have NEVER had your drinks out of a hand blown shot glass. I do not make these glasses, sadly but a RISD alum makes them and they have been a staple in my liquor cabinet for a time. Each is unique, a great and fun piece of art glass you can use. If you need more than two, double your pledge for more! Uh, thinking I may need to limit these, they are hand created just for this project!\nHand Made ONE of a kind shot glasses\nA hand crafted, blown decanter AND two shot glasses. Yes my same friends, Sarah and Myles are hard at work blowing glass into shapes to go with our fine spirits. One hand crafted decanter and two unique shot glasses that you will NEVER find a duplicate of one .\nOne of a kind hand made decanter and two glasses\nThe Garden Connection\nBecause of our connection to local and whole foods, and Sarah being a master gardener. The Garden Connection reward is working with you on your gardening project, or yard project. We have lots of tools for making your yard or garden look its best and for $1000 you get Sarah and John's labor and the tools and experience we have at hand. Planting, cultivating, Yard leaf & debris cleanup, power washing. Contact us with your questions and we can work together to make your place amazing.\nAbout the market\nDid you know New Hampshire is where the cocktail was invented? New Hampshire is the best place to open a distillery. Taxes are very favorable. Most states the taxes on liquor ads 50% to the price of the product. Here in the live free or die state; our largest tax burden is from the federal government. Since the state has all the control over the distribution of liquor, they earn their money as distributors. We will easily fit under the 5000 case limits so we will be able to sell directly from our distillery. This is a great asset, especially if we are able to find the suitable high traffic location. With over half a billion dollars worth of product sold at the NH Liquor Commission every year, we don't need much market share, less than 0.1% in order to garner a generous working profit.\nMarket analysis as reported by the state of NH Liquor Commission, and by the Distilled Spirits Industry 2014 figures. Spirit sales are up overall by 3.3% nationally and 3.8% in New Hampshire which is a great thing. More importantly, sales of value priced Vodka are steady and overall sales are up, so all the gains in the market are in the premium and super premium brands which is where we would place our products. Whiskey and Rum both have similar results; sales of premium products are showing a greater rate of increase than the budget products. The growth segments are in the 21 to 35 year old age bracket, so as their economic growth happens, they will continue to move they\u2019re purchasing up market. Here are links, check them out for yourself:\nhttp://www.discus.org/assets/1/7/Distilled_Spirits_Industry_Briefing_Feb_3_2015_Final2.pdf\nhttp://www.nh.gov/liquor/AnnualReportFY14.pdf\nSmall distilleries have less than a 2% market share, and only 700 small craft distilleries in the country at this time (small as in less than 10,000 cases per year). There are only 5 in the state of New Hampshire. The rate of growth in this segment is starting to see the beginning stages of expansion much as the growth of craft breweries started small and in the 80'x and 90's had double-digit growth. So much so that Budweiser is now advertising against the craft breweries. Craft distilling is now poised for the beginning of that kind of growth. There is so much room for growth of a small distillery, but in order to compete we need to get it right, with your help that will be insured.\nTrade Group Membership", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are Many risks and challenges.

If after reading everything, and you have questions please feel free to email me. I am more than willing to answer your questions. I have my Facebook page listed on the links section so you can see the food I will be making in my truck. On the page there is also a menu for you to view. \nI want to start a food truck that serves classic american southern comfort food for the soul. That's a mouthful I know. My menu is definitely a wide variety. I have all types of southern food, including southern BBQ. I did not want to just cater to BBQ, because I have so many other great dishes I know how to make that deserve to be on my menu. You just can't say it's southern unless of course there is BBQ, and boy oh boy, nobody does BBQ like me. I started a Facebook page for Mama's Table so I could start getting the name out there early. Also, every weekend I make items from my menu for people to taste and to show on the page. I did this to show people things to come once I am up and running. \nI'm trying to raise enough money to fund all expenses for the new truck, equipment needed, food, and money to live off of so I can devote 110 percent of my time. I am currently working and scraping by to save to get this underway. Hopefully Kickstarter can help me get everything taken care of.\nI have been planning this business for the last year. I simply woke up one day fed up with working for someone. I do not want to work for some company that does not care for me. Most places treat you as expendable, because the job force is so scarce they can turn around and hire someone the next day to replace you. \nI also intend on giving back to those less fortunate. I grew up poor. I mean I was so poor we couldn't afford the \"r\" in poor, we was po. My little brother Devin showed me an article of a guy out in Philadelphia named Mason Wartman, and he uses a Pay It Forward Board. The board is simple. People can buy items for the homeless in advance, and then a voucher, or post it note, goes on the board for someone less fortunate to cash in later on down the road. I was so impressed with what Mason was doing I Googled his restaurant in Philly, and actually got to speak with Mason. He was very friendly, and then I asked if he wouldn't mind it if I used his idea with my truck. Mason was more than happy to allow me the privilege to do so, and he also gave me a few pointers. I will create a couple of low cost items for my menu that will be low enough to entice someone to Pay It Forward. I included a link to Mason's website to Rosa's Fresh Pizza so you can check out his place and see how the Pay It Forward Board works. \nI have been shopping around for a good used truck. I have a few trucks I found online between $17K-$26K. Luckily there is a really great used restaurant equipment store in Portland I can go to to get what is needed, depending on the truck I get. There seems to be a lot of taco trucks that keep popping up for sale. I'm a haggler, so I am confident if I show up with a fair amount, people will give in. No one says no to money, especially once it is in their face.\nThe goal is to grow this business into trucks located through-out the NW.  After one year I want to purchase another truck or cart in Portland. Once I have it up and running I want to take my original truck on the road to see which cities in other states I can expand to. \nAnother goal is to turn Mama's Table into a brand. I make my own Marinara, BBQ sauce, and Pineapple-Mango marinade. I would like to eventually start jarring, and selling at my trucks. I will also be doing funny t'shirts, hoodies, and aprons for Mama's Table. I have a friend who runs a barber shop, who has a guy who runs a small screen printing business. I am all about buying local and supporting small businesses.  \nI'm also partnering with a good friend; Craig Haynes, who makes his own jerk rubs. His companies name is FiMi Kingston. I am including a link for his website so you can check out his business. Craig the owner, devotes a portion of the proceeds he makes to schools in Jamaica, Vietnam, and Oregon. I use Craig's Jamaican Jerk rub for my smoked turkey I make for the Smoked Turkey Dip on my menu. I'm also looking forward to having Craig come through to do tastings at my truck. I believe in helping people who are trying to be entrepreneurs like myself.\nFreshness and quality is what I'm about. I will shop locally at Gartner's Meats in Portland. They have fair prices, and great quality in meats. Another place I will be going through is Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods. There I will be getting my flour, cornmeal, beans, and gluten free products. I grew up within a mile of their store, and it is really nice. There you can buy in bulk to cut cost. I live right down the street from Portland Fruit Company. This place is amazing because I can buy in bulk here as well to cut my cost on vegetables and fruits. They have a larger store with more items I can shop at during winter days for wider selections, but for what I am serving it wouldn't be necessary. I have included links to these places for you to view as well. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are several risks. That's the challenge of starting a business from scratch. I am trying to raise enough money so that I can quit my job and pay my bills, so I can devote 110 percent of my time to my business. I have spoke with many people who have failed in running a food cart or truck, and even recently, someone who was trying to start one. the one thing they all didn't do was quit their job, and commit to their business. I also witnessed some people I worked for in a couple restaurants years ago do that same thing. In order to be successful you have to be there everyday. If I have to hire someone to help, at least I will be there to keep an eye and make sure everything goes the way it's supposed to. Besides, no one can do my food the way I make it. I am going to hire someone to help for prep work mostly. I will never get burned out because if you do what you love, you never have to work a day in your life again. \n\nSince Kickstarter only allows you to cash in if you raise all the money I am asking bare minimum to buy a used vehicle, and used equipment for my start up. I looked over every option available. I would love to go out and buy a brand new truck with everything I need equipped for $79k, but it is irresponsible of me to do that for my firs time. Later on down the road I am hoping to expand out to more trucks, so I will definitely consider that option then. \n\nThe reason I am going with a truck and not a cart is, I want to be able to go to certain places I have scouted out that are a hit, and no one is around to capitalize on around Portland. Also, if I gain popularity I want to go on the road and visit some other states to try and spread my business out. I would like to open a small cart up someplace, then hit the road with the truck. That way I am still keeping people happy in Portland. \n\nIf I come across portion issues and people want more I will simply incorporate into the menu an up-size option which I can call Papa's Plate. Everyone from the south knows Papa was served first, and he had the larger serving over everyone, but he always waited for Mama to sit down and join the table before eating. A King is only as strong as his Queen. The difference in portions will be the sides will get larger, so that I don't have to use up more of the meats. \n\nThere are always bumps in the road to getting things underway. I am prepared to deal with whatever comes my way. If my opening gets postponed, I will put in the extra time needed to get it as close to my official date as possible. If my permits don't go through, and I am stuck waiting, I will stay on the phone or appear at the business office to get my paperwork and necessary documents out in time. If I cannot get cleared by safety inspection, again I will put in the extra time to thoroughly go through what it is they say I need to get it running, All the things that can go wrong, and possibly will, because that is life, I am ready to take on. I am not afraid of failing, or trying. I am afraid of failing for not trying. \n\nI'm looking for believers in the american dream, that are willing to believe in me. If you're feeling like, \"oh this guy doesn't even have a business yet, why should I back him,\" that's fine. Can you spare a dollar or two? I would like for everyone who sees this to just donate one dollar. I would like to think this is going to be seen by thousands of people, and one dollar is nothing for most, but something to me.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Chad Harvey\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nWhen I was younger I struggled with my weight.

I am doing this because of what patties meant \nto me growing up as a kid in Jamaica and to add something positive to \nthe perception of Jamaica and Jamaicans to people all over the world.  \nGrowing up as teen in Kingston during the 70s, I lived next to a home \nbakery owned by a guy named Jah Lloyd. He baked beef patties and \nbulla. During the summers while on break from school, I would wake \nup to the distinct aroma of delicious beef patties being baked. After \nbrushing of my teeth and washing my face I would head over there and \nwould gladly helped doing whatever was asked of me, not for pay but \njust to learn what was going on plus to at some point handed a hot patty \ncoming right from the oven. To me this was the best thing next to \nsomeday going to Heaven. Taking the first bite into that patty as some \nof the flakes falls to the ground, gave me a feeling even up to today I \ncan't put into words, all I can say is that at that point everything in my \nworld was A OK.\nHow I Felt As A Kid In Jamaica Eating A Patty\nAs the summer progress, at times I was asked to drop \noff patties to nearby corner stores which I gladly did and at the end of \nthe day would check back for returns , more often than not there wasn't \nany to my personal disappointment knowing that I wouldn't have one \nlast patty for the day, but certainly not to Jah Lloyd. As time went on I \nlearned everything about the business from buying of the products \nneeded, preparation, baking, delivering and dealing directly with the \nowners of the stores we delivered to. I developed a passion for it that I \nhold dear even to this day. This went on until the summer of 1979 when \nthe violence in Jamaica broke out which abruptly brought an end to the \noperation.The violence greatly restricted our movements which in turn \ncut us off from the majority of the stores we delivered to. At the time I \ndidn't put much thought into what I had loss as staying alive took \nprecedent over everything else. What I had loss was my dream to \nsomeday run my own successful patty operation, a dream that was \nrevived when I migrated to the U.S in 1989 and saw how guys as \nyourself and people of all race and background liked this little heavenly \ndelight that had brought me so much joy as a teen back in Jamaica. \nEven thou the passion was ignite, it took over two decades later for me \nto finally act on my dream, for various reasons, such as furthering my \neducation in Business Management, starting a family,and learning the \nrules and regulations of the food industry in the U.S. \nBut glad to say my passion is even greater now than ever before. \nBeside my great passion for Jamaican Beef Patties another motivational \nfactor for me to bring them mainstream through out the world is, badly \nwanting to see my beloved Island of Jamaica be viewed in a positive \nlight by having them exposed to someone as perhaps yourself, who \nwouldn't have otherwise known of them. Something that you can take \nhome and share with your family or just grabbing a quick bite with \nfriends.True, Jamaica is known for Bob Marley, Reggae, to a lesser \nextent Usain Bolt and dear I say it, Marijuana (just keeping it real) this \nwould be a welcome positive addition to what Jamaica is widely \nassociated with. Just knowing that you, the potential new customers and \nalso for you the ones who have had Jamaican Patties before, can now \nget them on demand and knowing that each time you eat one that you \nare experience what I have been experiencing all my life is the driving \nforce that will forever keep me on the pursuit of this dream.\nHOW WILL I DO THIS? With the cooperation of as many convenience \nstores as possible, I will make Jamaican Beef Patties as readily \navailable as hamburgers are, all over the world. They will be fresh, hot \nand ready to go throughout the day. I have just graduated from a \nrenown culinary school in Phoenix, AZ, which the sole purpose of \nattending was to learn the rules and regulations of the food industry \nalong with acquiring additional cooking skills that will be of great value to \nme moving forward in my endeavor to achieve this goal. To ensure that \nit reaches you safe, hot and ready to eat, correct procedures has to be \nfollowed at all times, plus we have to have all the necessary equipment \nneeded to do this, in place. \nMaking Sure It Reaches You Safe.\nEquipment such as warming units at the locations they are to be \nsold, \nWarming Unit\nalong with Mobile Food Warming Units to transfer the patties from \nbakery to designated locations will be added as well.\nMobile Food Warming Units\nMultiple mixing units will also be needed.\nIndustrial Mixers\nWhat I Am Bringing To The Market.

Our idea is to create a gaming caf\u00e9 for the Ohio neighborhood and community.  The intended location is to have the gaming space sitting along a main street in Columbus, Ohio.  The space would be centered along a busy street that is near a high school.  And based on our marketing strategy, we would be able to cater to several yet related demographics.\nWith technology, social media and face to face communications, we want to help provide a physical extension of a place where gamers and sci-fi enthusiasts would be able to meet, socialize and have fun in an environment that is relaxing and inviting. \nWe started with a grassroots way of linking up with those that we could server and in doing so, we realized we have the opportunity to provide more services to the gaming community.\nAnd that is the question we have, what can we do now?\nWe are building a gaming space with parts of a caf\u00e9, and have come to you in hopes that you could help us make this a reality? \nWe Need More Space\nWe began as an online meet-up of like minds, to be able to meet, discuss and play games in whatever area that we could find...  As we have grown in numbers, we have noticed that we also have the opportunity to expand and support a more grounded experience for people of different, yet similar likes to be able to come to.\nAnd with that, we just need a space to help make it work better.\nWhy a Gaming Caf\u00e9?\nIn and around Ohio, as well as in Columbus, we found that gamers, sci-fi enthusiasts and the like would stay in comic shops until closing.  And after that, we too noticed that people would meet up later at restaurants and coffee shops.  The issue with that is that there have been issues with enthusiasts being able to share their likes and interests while eating, snacking as well as getting some coffee.\nSo we have come to the conclusion that we could invest in both our gamers and the surrounding area, not just Columbus, but Ohio as a whole.  This could be a destination spot for gaming, sci-fi, movies, and more!\nWithin this investment, in future preparation, we too have made arrangements to bring in locally sourced foods, bands and other products so that we can help to contribute to the economic welfare of our surrounding community.  It\u2019s our goal to also help provide jobs to the surrounding area as well.  Of that, our goal is to get the help of local artists\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nThe initial funding for this project would help for us to provide funding for the following, but not limited to: tables, chairs, coffee machine, refrigerator, espresso machines, shelves, musicians\u2019, outdoor signage and more.\nOnce we begin to meet our funding targets, we will provide more details to you in regards to where we are.

I had an opportunity to move on to a new project that I felt was a challenge and keep the Deli too. At that time my staff took over running the Deli and did a fine job of it.

Its graphical display is just like what you're used to!\nC.H.I.P. comes preinstalled with dozens of useful applications, tools and amazing games. Beyond those, C.H.I.P. can run THOUSANDS of free applications from the open source community. \nPocketC.H.I.P. makes C.H.I.P. portable!  PocketC.H.I.P. gives C.H.I.P. a 4.3\u201d touchscreen, QWERTY keyboard, and 5-hour battery - in a case small enough to fit in your back pocket.\nSPECS\n3,000 mAH battery \n4.3\" 470px x 272px screen w/ resistive touch \nFull Super-Clicky QWERTY keyboard \nRugged Injection Molded Shell \nFully open source \nGPIO breakouts \nC.H.I.P. is removable via hatch\nUSING PocketC.H.I.P. WITH C.H.I.P.\nAt 1Ghz and with 512MB of DDR3 RAM, C.H.I.P. is powerful enough to run real software, and handle the demands of a full GUI just as well as it handles attached hardware. Best of all, CHIP runs mainline Linux, which means it\u2019s easier than ever to keep teaching it new tricks without inheriting a pile of kernel patches. \nSpeaking of power, C.H.I.P. includes a fully integrated battery power circuit so that you can take your project outside right away. No external power circuit needed, just attach a 3.7v LiPo battery to C.H.I.P. and you\u2019re ready to go mobile. \nMost important, though, is that C.H.I.P. is built to be flexible. Whether you\u2019re building yourself a wall clock that counts down time to the next bus at your stop, or setting up a network of hundreds of solar-powered air quality sensors for use in disaster relief, you need the same basic tools to start from: a processor, a way to exchange data, and a way to power everything. With C.H.I.P., all the groundwork is laid, and the only question is what you\u2019ll do next.\nWe built C.H.I.P. to make tiny powerful computers more accessible and easier to use. A huge part of making C.H.I.P. accessible is making sure that it can change to meet the needs of the community. That's why both C.H.I.P. and PocketC.H.I.P. are both TOTALLY OPEN SOURCE. This means all hardware design files schematic, PCB layout and bill of materials are free for you the community to download, modify and use.\nCan\u2019t wait to get started developing on C.H.I.P.? Join our team! By backing at the Kernel Hacker level, you\u2019ll get one of the first 1000 pre-release \"Alpha\" C.H.I.P. prototypes, hot off the reflow line *THIS SEPTEMBER* PLUS you\u2019ll be first in line for five C.H.I.P.s and one PocketC.H.I.P. as soon as they are ready. This is a special backer level meant only for hardcore linux devs who want to make meaningful contributions toward helping us build C.H.I.P.\u2019s kernel software. If that sounds like the kind of challenge you\u2019d like to sink your teeth into, back at the Kernel Hacker level, and join us on the march towards open source glory! \u256d( \uff65\u3142\uff65)\u0648\nWe've worked very closely with the amazing team at Allwinner Technology to insure that all the necessary documentation and source code for the System on Chip and Power Management Chips used in C.H.I.P. will be available for the community to use and learn from.\nAt Next Thing Co. we love to make things. The only thing we love more than making, is sharing what we make. We're so excited to see what you'll do with a $9 computer.\nIt takes more than the whole Next Thing Co. team to make C.H.I.P. possible.

There's so much energy and positive activity happening in Downtown Akron just under the surface. #LovetheWall is a way to bring a burst of color to one of Downtown's main entryways and enhance people's lives on a daily basis.\nDowntown is the heart of Akron; the living room of the community. It's where we come together to work, experience arts and culture, enjoy a meal, and connect with the community. It's home to the Akron Civic Theatre, Akron Art Museum, Akron-Summit County Public Library, Lock 3 and an incredibly eclectic mix of diverse, independently owned businesses.\nSouth Broadway is a major entry point into Downtown Akron. Everyday, more than 10,000 vehicles pass The Wall (located between the Robert K. Pfaff METRO RTA Transit Center and The Depot Apartments). The Wall is very large in size and has a formidable presence as you enter Downtown. This public art project would serve as a welcome to Downtown, announcing to drivers and pedestrians that they have arrived in a place of importance, a place that matters, and a place we love.\nLocal artist Nathan Mayfield created the simple geometric design, which will incorporate mirrored stainless steel, inspired by international artist El Anatsui. The simple but classic look of the shapes will allow for a colorful, timeless, and vibrant design that fits the space and the traffic flow.\nMockup of finished mural by Mayfield.\nThe stainless steel panels, represented in the mockup by light blue panels and arrows, were inspired by El Anatsui's Broken Bridge displayed here:\nEl Anatsui's Broken Bridge, from New York Times, photo credit Erik Lasalle, Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York\nMayfield has completed planters in Downtown Akron with a similar design:\nPlanters near 47 N. Main St. designed and painted by Mayfield\n\nMayfield, an Akron native, is excited about transforming Downtown. \"I've lived in Akron my entire life. I've seen it go through a lot of changes. It's always been able to reinvent itself.\"\nMayfield remembers seeing a mural as a kid on the corner of West Bartges and Main Street, thinking to himself that he'd like to paint the city one day. #LovetheWall is his opportunity to give back to Akron. He hopes the project will help attract people back to Akron and realize that this city is still ever changing.

I hope kids get this opportunity!\"\n\"I am fascinated with automation, so to see your project in action, was a thrill. I am going to have to count my pennies to get me one of these.\"\n\"This is a really awesome project. I can only imagine the planning that went into the design of the circuit board alone.\"\nThe Story\n\"Electronics for Everyone!\"\nMost other educational platforms on the market today are either extremely expensive, or lacking in features. We saw plenty of solutions that were affordable, but lacked the functionality to grow with the user. We wondered: Can we create an easy to use, low-cost platform that was also full featured and would grow WITH the user? \nMeet Muribot\nMeet the Muribot Robotic Educational Platform\nOur dream is to create an affordableopen-source STEM platform that grows with the skill level of the individual using it. Something that is as useful to an elementary school student as it is to a university student, enabling people of all ages to explore those fields more freely than ever without having to spend a lot of money to do it.\nTo bring our dream to reality, we created Muribot. A $250 dollar robotic platform, that is nearly as cheap as a Mindstorms NXT, but with features comparable to one you might use at a university lab. We've packed this platform with an amazing set of features and functionality:\n8x Infrared Proximity Detectors\n8x Ambient Light Detectors\n2x Quadrature Wheel Encoders\n2x Line Detectors\n3-Axis Accelerometer\nYaw Rate Gyroscope\n3-Axis Magnetometer\nInfrared Transceiver\n1MB On-board Memory\n~6-8 Hours Battery Life\nReplaceable 900mAh Lithium Polymer battery\nCharging and Programming via USB\nI2C Extension bus to add your own sensors and hardware!\n1 Year Warranty - If it break, we'll fix it!\nThe Muribot Mainboard with IR Proximity/Ambient Light Sensors\nARM/Raspberry PI/Arduino Compatible!\nBy installing the I2C slave firmware ANY third party hardware that has I2C capabilities can take control of the Muribot! All the sensors are on the same exposed I2C bus, so your hardware will have access to ALL of the platforms sensing capabilities! And with our 3D printable mounting bracket, you can make sure you get a secure fit to our platform.\nWith Muribot, you're only restricted by your imagination!!\nAs part of building and designing Muribot, I've spent the last two years and nearly $5,000 of my own money towards refining the design, packing more features into a less expensive platform until I had the low-cost high-quality product you see here today.\nWho can use Muribot\nMuribot is for students, hobbyists, and researchers. It was designed for people of all ages to explore STEM concepts and learn about robotics and coding. When you buy a Muribot, you get something comparable to a $4,000 platform.\nMuribot is a great resource for teachers and educators, and is the perfect complement to any Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum. Muribot can be used to explore basic concepts such as:\nObstacle Avoidance\nMaze Solving\nLine Following\nFollow/Avoid light\nShape Drawing\nOdometry\nSerial Communication\nAnd some more advanced concepts:\nPID Control Loops\nRoom Mapping/Path-finding\nSignal Filtering\nSensor Fusion\nFuzzy Logic\nNeural Networks\nSwarm Robotics\nHow is Muribot different?\nMuribot is different from other educational robotic platforms due to it being a university level platform that's designed to grow with the individual. The included API allows inexperienced users to easily explore robotics concepts without the complexity of learning how to use an embedded platform. A more experienced user could opt to control the hardware directly and forgo the library altogether.\nLightweight, Durable, and Compact package\nWith the only additional hardware being a USB cable the small size makes Muribot easy to transport and the hard outer casing means Muribot can survive and accident or two. Our cases will be printed on a Form1+ printer and will be very ABS-like in terms of durability.\nEasy to Program\nCross-Platform, Open-source and Hacker friendly\nWe are built on the shoulders of open source giants, so it would only make sense to make our hard work open source as well. MuriProg is written in C using Qt making it easy to compile for Linux or Mac; you just plug-in, install, and start programming no matter what OS you have!\nWe designed the Muribot be user repairable and to use as many common and readily available components as possible, as well as making it easy to access our I2C bus and 3.3V line without having to modify the mainboard itself at all.\nWhy We Need You!\nIf you support our project, it will help us to truly bring Muribot to life and to the world. We will be able to purchase the equipment and enough supplies necessary to create them quickly, efficiently, and easily; as well as spend more time focusing on getting Muribot out into the world in general. We believe in the open source movement, and if we're successfully funded we'll be releasing all the files to create a Muribot online, for anyone to use to build their own Muribot.\nBy supporting us, you keep control of the company away from a bunch of greedy investors, who may or may not understand our dream and vision as well as we do.\nFacebook! - http://www.facebook.com/moarobotics/\nTwitter! - http://www.twitter.com/moarobotics/\nOf course, the best way you can help us is by getting the word out! Sharing our project on Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media is really the greatest thing you could do to help with this and future projects. AND we will be forever grateful for your assistance in spreading the word.\nHow will the funds be used?\nOne thing we feel strong about is being open with you, the backers. A lot of Kickstarters do not disclose how they are going to use the funding they receive. We've done a lot of research into successful and failed Kickstarters to determine exactly how we should go about planning it, and pitfalls we should avoid.\nEquipment and Supplies\nCurrently the thing we are in the greatest need of right now is a couple Form1+ printers. We priced injection mold tooling for the Muribot case. Tooling costs $8,000-$17,000 dollars, and when compared to the cost of a new Form1+ ($3,300) it's easy to see which way to go. The Form1+ is simply superior in price, and it can print complex and thin parts which we require not only for Muribot but for other products we're designing.\nAnother big factor is simply the fact that to facilitate the mold tooling would require us asking for nearly $20,000 dollars more. We're not greedy and we simply couldn't risk spending any funding on what could become a $17k paperweight.\nIf we're going to be building and shipping these robots we'll also need lots of supplies, things for shipping like boxes and packing materials; Electronic components such as PCB boards, resistors, sensors, etc.; and miscellaneous supplies like product manuals and USB cables.\nThe Form1+ uses a UV resin that isn't cheap and will make up a bulk of our ongoing production costs, as well as other supplies to facilitate the printing process. There may also be maintenance costs for these machines, as they will be doing a lot of work.\nBacker Fulfillment\nKickstarter Rewards @ a Glance\n The most important thing for you that we will be spending money on will be fulfilling backer rewards so if you support us at bronze or above you actually get what you wanted. Based on our research and from our own projection, we've found that about 75% of the funding we receive will be used to build Muribots for our backers. This was expected, and our funding goal matches that expectation.\nI've spent a lot of my own time and money refining the process to be as low-cost as possible, so that I can give you our assurance that if you support Muribot you WILL get your reward as promised.\nDelivery Time-line\nDelivery will be divided up into four distinct phases: Funding, Purchasing and Receiving Supplies, Assembly and Testing, Packaging and Shipping. Each of these phases are discussed in more detail in Risks and Challenges.\nFunding \u2013 ~1 Month\nPurchasing and Receive Supplies - ~2-4 Months\nAssembly and Testing \u2013 ~4-8 Months\nPackaging and Shipping \u2013 ~1-2 Months\nBased on the above numbers, a tentative estimate to delivery completion would be 8-15 months. We feel this is a nice safe number that will give us breathing room; in the end if we finish ahead of schedule that's all the better.\nTechnical Specifications\nMuribot Technical Specifications\n About Mid-Ohio Area Robotics\nOur philosophy here at MOAR is \u201cElectronics for Everyone!\u201d- We believe an educational robot could be an amazing tool to spread interest in the programming, electronics, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. We have designed Muribot with parents, educators, kids, robot enthusiasts, and researchers in mind. We hope that Muribot will lower the barrier into those fields and cultivate a whole new generation of scientists, programmers, and engineers.\nAbout Michael Stone\nMichael Stone, CEO/President of MOAR\n Michael Stone is Founder, CEO and President at Mid-Ohio Area Robotics where he designs affordable educational and hobby electronics for people of all ages. He creates unique modules and platforms that make it easy to explore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  \nBefore founding MOARobotics, Michael has spent nearly a decade in a variety of electronics manufacturing and production environments for several Fortune 100 companies. Bridging multiple disciplines he now designs and produces low-cost electronics solutions .\nHis passion for robots started in his childhood and has stayed with him ever since. He embraces and embodies the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and Open Education movements and works actively to contribute to those areas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe team behind Mid-Ohio Area Robotics has more than 5 years of industry experience manufacturing and fulfilling large quantities of consumer electronics products. We have our own in-house assembly equipment and have a lot of experience with the bugs and gremlins that can sneak into any well thought out plan. We have sent our products around the world, and thus we already have solutions in place for shipping.\n\nWhen designing Muribot, we have been very careful to only use parts that are readily available in large quantities with short or no lead time. At the time of this writing, there is enough stock available in the US to make hundreds of Muribots, and all critical components are purchased from reliable sources inside the US. It is quite unlikely that any part will require a lead time, but it is a remote possibility nonetheless.\n\nWe have our printed circuit boards manufactured in China and have long standing relationships with several companies specializing in circuit boards. There is a chance that parts sourced from overseas could be lost, damaged, or otherwise unusable. This would add some additional time and cost, if we had to order some parts a second time. This is unlikely, but a risk worth mentioning.\n\nA fulfillment delay could result if demand for Muribot exceeds our capacity to assemble them in-house. If that were to occur, we have relationships with a few manufacturers here in the US that could pick up the work load should a significant problem arise. Typically these companies have a lead time anywhere from five to eight weeks; therefore a two month turnaround time is the longest delay we could imagine occurring if we had to shift to one of these manufacturers. Again this is unlikely, but worth mentioning.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Michael Stone\n3 created \u00b7 14 backed\nI am an electronics engineer, musicophile, and 3D printing enthusiast from Maryland.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Cancellation :(", "update_content": "So after a lot of testing, we\u2019re proud to announce tha Muribot is 100% compatible with ARM, Raspbery Pi, Arduino, and many more!

I was mostly in front of a computer 12+ hours a day, but we also put on the Dream Series, which were meaningful events to help kickstart people's dreams. A few hours after an amazing obstacle course run through Golden Gate Park, my sciatica pain began. The pain and discomfort made it hard to concentrate, do great work and enjoy life.\nPost-race wearing the trophy (the Golden Shoes) a few hours before sciatica pain would forever change my life. #NotWorthIt\nI tried dozens of products, therapies and techniques to help with my back pain. Many of them had great features, but weren't full solutions for me. The Neo G Posture Brace: helped with alignment, but it was difficult to breathe and really bulky under my clothes; Easy Posture Lumbar Support: I still managed to wiggle and slump in my chair, and it only helped when I sat at my desk; the Nada Chair: brilliant knee form and pelvic stabilization, but gave me knee pain after just a few minutes of wear; LF Ultrasound: provided short-term pain relief, but it was fleeting; Memory Foam Knee Pillow: provided better alignment when I started sleep, but would end up in the bottom of my bed; and on and on.\nA friend and I spent weeks tinkering with anything we could find to help get back support. There are still taped together take-out soup containers for lumbar support floating around my apartment. The first version of the BetterBack knees? A cut out from the top of a mega-sized protein bottle. \nMaking the latest knee prototypes. So many iterations in between!\nI had no idea how many people were suffering from back pain when this all began. I felt way too young to have back pain, personally. Friends or colleagues would see me wearing the early versions of BetterBack and ask to try it. As soon as they did, I would get messages all the time: \"Oh hey, I'm flying to New York on Tuesday, any chance I can borrow that thing you wear?\" Or \"My back is acting up, any chance I can just borrow it until Friday?\" I had no idea so many people were suffering. I began to do more research and was blown away by what I found.  I decided to make more -- and invest time and money into making it better. \nSix prototypes later, I began working with manufacturers to build a high quality, well crafted and incredibly comfortable posture strap I would be proud to see my mom wear. And your mom too, if she doesn't have an awesome back.\nI'm on Kickstarter for two reasons. One, I'm hoping 500 people will pledge so I can hit the minimum order quantity and produce the very first run of BetterBacks. Even more importantly, I'm hoping to find people who will go on the journey with me to get a better back. I want to hear your story, what has worked and hasn't worked for you in the past, understand how BetterBack helps you and how it can help you better.  Please join me.\nGood posture affects your health, your mood and your motivation. Most people only begin to understand the importance of posture after their body is so damaged from slumping that sitting aches become chronic pain. I know because I am one of them.\nMy mission is to help people be their best selves and unlock their full potential. Without health, that is impossible; it is the foundation for everything else.\nI have spent the last few years learning about back pain, trying a huge range of products and therapies, and developing BetterBack with dozens on dozens of bad backs and amazing souls.\nThe relief and support people feel while wearing BetterBack\u2014and even after\u2014is truly amazing. No matter how many times or tools you\u2019ve tried to sit pain free, BetterBack is like posture training wheels so you can experience and integrate good posture into your life for good.\nI have self funded the design, development and sampling for BetterBack. Our final prototype has been well tested and our manufacturers are ready to go. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, packaging and shipping. \nBetterBack was my first Kickstarter campaign. It has been some of the most amazing and challenging few weeks of my life. If you are thinking of running a crowdfunding campaign, I encourage you to take the leap and go for it. You will connect with the most incredible global community of supporters and get to bring a part of yourself to life. I wanted to share some of the amazingly talented people who contributed to my campaign; maybe one day they will help you with your campaign too.\nIndustrial Design // I had the chance to work with three amazing industrial designers on the development of BetterBack.\nAndy Storms is a softgoods and SolidWorks pro.

It is comfortable to wear all day long, but even 15 minutes a day can greatly improve the quality of your life.\nWill I look stupid wearing it?\nIt's hard to believe, but most people don't even notice when you're wearing it. I sit through meals, meetings and flights with BetterBack on and it's only when I'm taking it off that people tend to notice it, with a \"you've been wearing that this whole time?!!\" The thing that tends to happen next is someone shares their story of back pain and asks to try it on. \nHow comfortable are the knee straps?\nI have absolutely terrible knees (at one point I was put in two leg casts because of feet and knee injuries, later having surgery on my right knee). We spent a lot of time designing the knee cushions so that the force was widely distributed and comfortable for people who have knee problems *and* back problems.\nCan I wear BetterBack while I drive?\nUnfortunately, no. BetterBack is not safe to wear driving, or when you need quick leg mobility. It is great for sitting at your desk, eating, meeting, going to a movie, sitting on an airplane, meditating, etc. Note: you can wear BetterBack cross-legged! \nHow is this different than the Nada Chair?\nLet me start by pouring heaps of praise and adoration on Dr. Toso who came up the knee form to help people with their posture. I have tried the Nada Chair and while I loved the stabilization it offered, it unfortunately hurt my knees very badly to wear after just a few minutes. It wasn\u2019t a solution for me as a result.\nBetterBack uses the same knee form as the Nada Chair, but the design and construction of the knee pads, back support and straps are new, incorporating six rounds of prototyping with two amazing Industrial Designers and the feedback of 62 wonderful backs who beta tested it last year and this year. Here are some of the ways BetterBack is different:\nKnees, knees, knees!\nWe use PE (polyethylene) to disperse force and foam to provide cushiony comfort on the knees, so even people with bad knees can wear BetterBack. Because of backer support, everyone\u2019s knee pads will now include thicker compression molded foam for even more durability and comfort. :)\nBack pad\nBetterBack is worn outside of clothing, but it can still get hot on an airplane, at a game or when things heat up at work. BetterBack combines a perforated foam and spacer mesh for maximum back breathability, without sacrificing lumbar support.\nStraps & Adjustability\nStrap adjusters are placed where your hands naturally rest, for easy tightening and loosening. Quick slip keepers keep the straps flush against BetterBack for a clean and minimalist look.\nUsability\nWe\u2019ve developed two ways to make sure people can put BetterBack on quickly and correctly. The first is using a poly cotton fabric for the outside materials and a spacer mesh for the inside materials that touch your body. On inside surfaces, we\u2019ve also included easy to read icons so you know exactly which way is up without any guessing.\nMaterials\nWe want people to feel good and confident wearing BetterBack, so we\u2019ve sourced high quality, durable materials similar to what you\u2019d find in fashion, rather than in the medical section.\nThis all started in my kitchen, trying to make something to help me with my excruciating sciatica pain. My friends and people I\u2019d meet all around San Francisco turned out to need it too. Never in my wildest dreams did I think it would be such a success on Kickstarter! I believe Dr. Toso was a visionary and I hope to see much more attention and innovation on the knee form/pelvis stabilization in the years to come, just as innovation on lumbar support products mean people looking can find something just right for them.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have extensive manufacturing and operational experience (I used to manufacture interiors to large condominium buildings and hotels), plus two manufacturers capable of delivering BetterBack. One thing I know for sure: something unexpected always comes up. I\u2019ve buffered my timeline to account for unexpected curveballs that may impact the schedule, so I can deliver BetterBack to you on time. These things could also impact the delivery schedule:\n\nVolume - sometimes Kickstarter campaigns wildly exceed a project creator\u2019s expectation. If we hit huge volume, it may push the timeline back, likely to the tune of 14 days. \n\nReally awesome ideas - I know I will receive some amazing ideas and insights from the Kickstarter community. I don't want to lose out on the ability to deliver you a superior product, if it can be reasonably done.\n\nFreight - Port closures and customs delays happen. It\u2019s impossible to know when and for how long. The buffer calculated into the timeline should cover this, but it is an unknown.\n\nMy goal is to deliver the highest quality, most effective posture strap on the market. I will work my back off for you and deliver transparency all the way through. Feel free to reach out to me personally anytime you have a thought, idea or a question at kk@getbetterback.com.\n\nLast but not least: any pledge amount brings us closer to our goal -- both of hitting our first production run and of building awareness around good posture.

We are offering a $10 shipping discount per game purchased. This makes shipping in the United States free, and shipping to other parts of the world in some cases relatively inexpensive.\nGiven this strategy, backers from different parts of the world will get their games at different times. While the rewards on the backer levels say September here is a schedule of when we expect the games to be shipped to different places, in conjunction with other milestones:\n1. China/Asia - ship to backers by or before July\n2. United States/\"Rest of World\" - ship to backers by or before August\n3. European Union - ship to backers by or before September\n4. Broad Distribution - released just in time for the SPIEL '15 (October 8).\nThe summer convention season is the most important for our business and thus, once all of the games have arrivedin the U.S. via container ship, we will sell at conventions - particularly GenCon - which in some cases may occur before backers have received their games from our fulfillment partner. It will only be sold there at full MSRP, $60. We will also offer any backers who elect for it free pickup at the convention.\nThe attention GenCon offers this game is so valuable to our business. We hope that, in backing us, you want us to be successful beyond just receiving your reward from this campaign. If you are not happy with this policy we fully understand your choosing not to back this campaign. Thank you for even considering offering your support - we are grateful!\nWe've already begun the early design process on the first Tesla vs. Edison expansion. However, we want to invite you, our Kickstarter backers, to share your ideas about what we should or could include, and express your preferences about which ideas you'd most like to see!\nDuring the campaign we'd like to invite your suggestions in the Kickstarter comments. When the appropriate stretch goals are reached we will take all of your and our ideas that seem viable to us and within the range of things we would consider acceptable and put them all up for a vote by out backers. Whichever of those gets the most votes will definitely be included. We hope to have a few rounds of voting and thus backer contributions to the design. The expansion won't be limited to those things but will definitely include there. Here are some art examples, as well as just conceptual ideas:\n6th player expansion with a historical company\n6th player expansion with an ahistorical company. Actually it is a real company just not in the electricity business.\nFemale luminaries. Real inventors and entrepreneurs who thrived in other fields during the same-ish period.\n Other current expansion ideas:\n- \"Robot\" to allow solitaire, 1 player games\n- New/alternate board and project maps\n- \"Storytelling\" game resolutions: narrative outcomes based on the final game conditions, in addition to simply appointing a winner\n- Additional, historical \"War of Currents\" luminaries\n- Conflict cards that bring more conflict, player-vs-player spicy-ness into the game: labor strikes, sabotage, shady dealings, and other historical elements from the real War of Currents infusing into the game\nThe plan for the expansion is to serve as modules, not an all-or-nothing. So, whatever we end up shipping, you can take or leave (for example) the conflict cards. View the expansion as ways to customize and extend the game for your group and game session, not as a set template that is a wholesale replacement for the base game.\nWe expect to Kickstart this as its own project in the first half of 2016.\nWe are a new game company, built by experienced designers, developers, artists, and games industry business people. We are combining our collective 40+ years in the business to design, develop, and deliver games that offer fresh themes, innovative mechanics, and smooth playability.\nThe Tesla vs. Edison project is the culmination of key contributions from our team:\n- On his own and as Conquistador Games, designer Dirk Knemeyer has run five successful Kickstarters. His latest games, the War Stories series, are being celebrated as \"state-of-the-art\" in the innovations they brought to the well-worn tactical combat genre. He is a host of www.thegamedesignroundtable.com, which is worth a listen for anyone interested in game design.\n- Developers Rob Seater and John Coveyou brought very different experiences to the product development process. Seater has developed many different games, including one of the best-designed games in print, Glory to Rome. He brings  a rigor and deep experience that none of the Knemeyer/Conquistador games of the past has at their disposal. Coveyou, himself the successful publisher of two Kickstarter games via his Genius Games, has a deep mathematics and science background in both university and his professional career. He combined these methods and processes with his insatiable energy to infuse the project with an additional development layer.\n- Artists Heiko G\u00fcnther and Jess Riola combine skill in making beautiful things with years of experience providing art, illustration, and design in the games industry. G\u00fcnther has served as the art director and designer for all of the Knemeyer/Conquistador games. Along with winning awards for his work on these games he has contributed art to more than 20 different tabletop games. Riola provided the custom illustration for Tesla vs. Edison and has contributed wonderful art in the video games industry for more than seven years.\n- Nils Herzmann, who provides leadership across marketing and sales for everything at Artana, has been part of the convention staff at Asmodee, the largest game company in the world, for more than a decade. His participation is new to our publishing process.\nWe also want to thank some very good people beyond the above team for donating free time in amounts large and small to contribute to or advise us about the Kickstarter portion of this project: Brian Liston, Jamey Stegmaier, Nate Lovett.\nOur project video includes alterations made to original images that are generously-made-available by people thru creative commons attribution. Check out the full credits and information for these images on the YouTube page for the video: http://youtu.be/rQv17CaGSmQ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are so appreciative for the opportunity to create games, and for Kickstarter connecting directly with our backers and future customers!\n\nArtana is extending and improving on the legacy established by Conquistador Games and Dirk Knemeyer. Since 2012 that team had five Kickstarter projects, spanning five total games and one very large campaign for metal gaming coins. Three of those games were delivered essentially on-time and our backers were happy with our service. The last two games, part of the same campaign, suffered from the original designer dropping out of the project literally within days of the end of the project. We pushed our entire publishing schedule back a year and redesigned that game from the ground-up in order to fulfill successfully to our backers, which we did albeit almost a year late. The coins campaign, as a product of its own success, unlocked numerous stretch goals that were asked for by the backers and naively agreed to by our team. The problem was that we did not have a clear view of the production and fulfillment nightmares that this would cause. In trying to satisfy our backers and meet their various needs we agreed to a lot of things that we were too ignorant to realize would make that campaign push out and be more than a year late. The fulfillment for that project is currently in process. Backers getting the coins are effusive in their praise for the quality of the final product.\n\nOur team felt joy and pride in our successes and shame and frustration in our failures. Along with learning from those experiences, we've reached out and created a larger and more extended team to participate with this game. We believe that we have created an approach to Tesla vs. Edison that will guarantee this is an exemplar of a Kickstarter campaign:\n\n1. The game is completely designed - we continue to tune the economy and are trying to make the rulebook ever-better, but we believe in the game as-is, right now, today - and the production process has begun. The Kickstarter is timed to end at the point that we need to put in our deposit, and commit to final quantities. This ensures the highest possible chance of delivering on-time to our backers short of pre-printing the game - in which case, why would we be Kickstarting to begin with?!\n\n2. Stretch goals that upgrade the base game have already been discussed with our production partner and will not add production time to include. They have been 100% incorporated into the production engineering for the game.\n\n3. We will not have stretch goals outside of the upgrades to the game that require physical shipping to backers. There's lots of cool things that we could do about Tesla, Edison, and the other rocking personalities from the War of Currents that would both be awesome and send us back into \"ZOMG this is going to be super late because we were so successful!\" territory. We simply won't sign up for that. Maybe one of you could do a Kickstarter for some fantastic Tesla memorabilia? We will happily point our backers to it! :-)\n\nWhether our Kickstarters delivered on time or late we always always always always always delivered a quality product. Bottom line. Now, as a larger team here at Artana, our ability to be on-time and continuing to increase the quality of what we do is stronger than it's ever been.

Now you can, with Prynt: the first ever instant camera case for smartphones. Just plug in your iPhone or Android device, snap a photo or choose one from your favorite social network, and print it out in thirty seconds!\nPrynt is portable, lightweight and fun! Snap and print photos anywhere, anytime. \nIt's ideal for when you're out with your friends, sightseeing, or capturing a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Gifts and cards become more special when you include an instant photo. Take it with you on the go and never miss the chance to shoot and share some everyday magic.\nWe also designed Prynt to be modular so it can fit different types of phones. The part of the case that contains the dock can be easily changed based on the phone model. That means if you upgrade or change phones, you don't need a whole new Prynt Case, just order a new dock adapter from us and keep printing.\nLastly, we worked hard to design a beautiful object you'll love to carry.

What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not.  Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn.  Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating.  It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With KickStarter's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.\nLet's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder is no exception to that rule.  The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets.  If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories.  So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight.  You can't.\nBut if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.\nWe'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories.  Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising.  If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.\nIf you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold.  If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment.  If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.\nSo, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute.  Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder and enhance your calorie burn.\nWhether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort.  Note that The Cold Shoulder cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.\nThe Problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories\nThe first thing I always hear when I say I\u2019m touting a \u201ccold vest\u201d is, \u201cI don\u2019t like being cold.\u201d But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over\u2010stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro\u2010intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.\nThere is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long.  There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories.   But it's not.\nThe Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure\nIn addition to exercise, there\u2019s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It\u2019s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you\u2019re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact \u2013 and I should know,  since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.\nThe idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.\nI was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, \"If cold exposure burns calories, there\u2019s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn.\" That\u2019s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. The vest looks like this:\nThe Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest\nI have put it to the scientific test and proved this vest's efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Here are a few before-and-after shots after just 3 weeks of using The Cold Shoulder:\nResults of 3 weeks of wearing The Cold Shoulder\nConsidering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?\nWhy You\u2019ll Love The Cold Shoulder\n1. Burns calories without exercise. Whether you\u2019re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you \u2013 the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.\n2. Saves time. It takes about 30s to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Then you go about your day until the ice melts, and it's another thirty seconds to take it off and put it back into the freezer.  Do that twice a day, and you've spent 2 minutes to burn 500 calories. Compare that to the same calories burned in a gym workout, which can consume several hours once you include travel time, change room time, and waiting for the machines that are busy when you want to use them. Two minutes vs. two hours, for the same 500 calories.\n3. It\u2019s effective. The idea is based on decades of research by scientists from Harvard to Cambridge and beyond. Mild cold exposure burns calories \u2013 it\u2019s a scientific fact. The only question is how to do it comfortably, effortlessly.... even fashionably!\n4. It\u2019s comfortable. The first time you wear it, yes, it'll feel cold. But you won\u2019t shiver. After trying it a few times, you\u2019ll hardly notice you\u2019re wearing it. Some of our current users actually look forward to putting it on.\n5. It gets more effective the more you use it. As your body acclimatizes to periodic mild cold exposure, it gets more used to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories. It gets easier and easier to burn off more and more calories, just like going to the gym gets easier the more you do it. This is exactly opposite to drugs or supplements, which usually decrease in effectiveness as your body builds a tolerance to them.\n6. It\u2019s fashionable. You can wear it pretty much anywhere. I've worn it to fancy French restaurants, as part of a 3-piece suit. I even tried wearing it on my wedding day, but my fianc\u00e9 \u2013 now wife \u2013 decided it wasn\u2019t quite ready for that.\n7. Sold direct at wholesale prices. Expect to pay significantly more once this is available in retail stores. There\u2019s no middle man on KickStarter. We\u2019ll manufacture your vest and ship it directly to you.\nHow Does It Work? \nThe Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn\nYou don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure \u2013 such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank \u2013 can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you.  On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.\nFor example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. It\u2019s the water. They spend their day in water that\u2019s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.\nDue to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.\nAny mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it\u2019s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it\u2019s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.\nOur vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:\nDue to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.\nThese are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you'd burn without it.\nExample clinical trial result - Nick Hamilton\nBelow is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss.\nNick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen.\nEvidence from independent scientists\nFor more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it's independent and objective.\nOur Mission\nWe want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn\u2019t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.\nWhy We Need You!\nAlthough we have the designs and prototypes finished and our manufacturer stands ready to produce the vests, the cost of production is high unless we fulfill minimum order quantities. In order to cover the costs of fabric and production at this level, we need to commit to this minimum order quantity to secure the best deal, which can then be passed onto you, with special rewards exclusively offered here on Kickstarter!\nWill It Fit Me?\nWe have sizes to fit everybody from XS to XXX-L. We\u2019ll get your sizing option after the funding period is over.\nThe Details\nInside-out view of the front + back of the vest, showing ice pocket locations.\nRe-inforced stitching at stress points\nVelcro closure on ice pockets to firmly hold ice packs in place\nVelcro closure at the front of the vest, which allows tightening the waist as you lose weight\nThe Cold Neck can be used alone or in conjunction with the vest to add an additional 20-25% calorie burn.\nBacker Rewards\nStretch Goals:\nWomen\u2019s sizes: Although the current vest is unisex, it's not particularly flattering to the female form. If we reach about $40k in funding, we will have enough spare capital to hire a female clothing designer to design a version more tailored to the female form. We envision it as having a fashionable waist-level fabric body-wrapping belt to adjust the waist size, rather than Velcro.  If we get here, and you want a female version of the vest, you'll be able to choose that after the funding period is over, but it'll probably add about an extra month to your delivery date.\nProduction Plan\nOnce funded, we will put in our order for materials. Delivery and preparation of materials may take 2-4 weeks. During that time we\u2019ll confirm sizing for all of our backers and prepare the manufacturing process. To ensure quality construction, we\u2019re personally overseeing manufacturing of our vests in the Los Angeles Fashion district, which requires 4-6 weeks. We source our ice packs from the USA.  Once the vests are made, we\u2019ll prepare them for shipment (at most 1-2 weeks), and then ship them to your door (2-3 days Domestic US, or 1-2 weeks International). \nTotal time from funding to shipment: Between 8-12 weeks within the continental US, plus another 1-2 weeks for international shipments.\nOur Guarantee\nWe are confident that you will be happy with your vests and the results it will produce, but if for any reason you\u2019re not completely satisfied, just send it back (you pay shipping, and please give us a \u201cheads up\u201d first), and we'll repair or replace your vest and ship it back to you free of charge.\nTESTIMONIALS\n\u201cThe Cold Shoulder allowed me to cut body fat while still gaining Lean Body Mass. It\u2019s easy to use and makes experimenting with cold exposure simple.\u201d\u2013 Nick Hamilton\n\u201cAfter just 2 weeks wearing The Cold Shoulder, I lost approximately 5.5% of my body fat. A loss like this for effectively doing nothing is excellent.\u201d\u2013 Robert Camille\n\u201cIn addition to the extra 1.5 lbs I lost using The Cold Shoulder, my second favorite benefit was that my sleep improved. I wore it for a few minutes before bed every night and slept much more soundly than I had done for months.\u201d\u2013 Mike Sirak\n\u201cThanks to The Cold Shoulder I was able to eat 6000 more calories over two weeks while having friends and family visit without any weight gain. It is great to be able to indulge a bit without losing precious progress.\u201d\u2013 Kyle Timblin\n\u201cI lost 5 lbs and an inch off my torso in just 3 weeks using The Cold Shoulder. I wore it only once or twice a day, and it was cool and comfortable.\u201d - Jocelyn Hayes\n\u201cI lost 15 lbs. in 3 weeks.  I lost much of my stomach flab and it was easy to use!\u201d - Anthony Peters\nTHANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nPlease take a look at the rewards - we hope you'll take advantage of our special early bird offer, but any contribution big or small helps lots!

Take a look at how they react when hit or missed and all of the things that differentiate them from each other.\nThe Grey Lady may be shy, but she's not afraid to stop your roughhousing in its tracks. If this librarian has paid your scenario a visit, she won't go quietly! If you do manage to get her attention, she leaves you only with your thoughts, waiting to cramp your style in the next adventure! The Grey Lady will add a challenge to many scenarios, especially if playing more than one in a single session. \nSandman will include a custom scenario specifically designed for him.\nZombie Taxi Drivers are eager to take the Ecto-1 on a joy ride around town! Once one of them reaches your ride, he immobilizes it until you get rid of him, but not until he sends it speeding off, ghost rider style!\nThe Zombie Taxi Drivers will come with a scenario specifically designed for them. However, they can also be used as Class 1 replacements and companions in base game scenarios. \nNote: When differently named Ghosts share a Class, roll a d6 for each, with the higher roll making an appearance. Impossible Mode versions get +3 to this roll!\nPlayer Cards\nUp to 4 players take on the roles of the Ghostbusters and attempt to return balance between the Spirit World and ours, busting ghosts and sealing the gates from which they\u2019re invading. Completing a scenario requires teamwork, planning, and resourcefulness.  \nMelanie Ortiz keeps a watchful eye on her coworkers, and a closer eye on her targets. Her selfless acts bring her closer to knowing herself, and in turn, in how to deal with the approaching end game of the other worldly intruders.\nJanine\u2019s quick response time is her key attribute at the front desk and as a Ghostbuster! When she spots a newly summoned Ghost, she acts fast, and when she sees a fellow Ghostbuster in a tight situation, she leaps into action!\nKylie thinks things through, to the point where she anticipates what's coming! Her research into the forbidden arts has granted her insight into the dark intentions of her enemies, whose actions seem entirely random to everyone else.\nRon is always trying to prove he has the chops to be a better Ghostbuster, even if that means putting himself in danger. He's no schlub when it comes to tech and the closer he gets to a threat, the more brazen he becomes.\nPeter Venkman is a risk-taker who does his best work in close proximity to ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nRay Stantz excels at removing slime from his fellow Ghostbusters.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nEgon Spengler is a wild man with his proton pack, but learns from his mistakes.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nWinston Zeddemore aids the team by being the best at depositing trapped ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nFeatured ghosts from the movies, cartoons, comics, and toylines have unique abilities as well, in terms of how they move and react to your actions.\nThe game features 3 campaigns, each with 4 unique scenarios. It\u2019s a fast-paced game: each scenario takes approximately 30 intense minutes to play. Every campaign concludes with an epic battle against an iconic boss character.\nThe game uses dice to resolve a lot of the action, so it\u2019s never the same game twice! The three types of dice represent the proton packs and ghost traps, the unpredictable movements of the ghosts, and the chaotic activity of the gates. During each turn, players move, shoot proton streams, deposit trapped ghosts, use unique character abilities, and drive the Ecto-1 to complete objectives. \nEach scenario\u2019s map is constructed using double-sided tiles, featuring street and park imagery by the talented Robb Mommaerts.

And rest assured that if we exceed $2,000 by another $250 (and another, and another), I will be adding more FREE stuff! \nAll we have to do is raise more money, and you get more stuff for free. Win-win.\nP.S. The Yeti buttons/pins have been upgraded to a glow-in-the-dark version!\n=== END UPDATE ===\nPerfect for your backpack, sleeping bag (popular with scouting and camping enthusiasts). You kids will love these more than you will (yes, you can order more than one!), and if they are in the Boy Scouts or Girls Scouts, these are a superb addition to the patch collection as I've been told by many happy customers/fans of the original Bigfoot Patrol patch.\nYeti Squad embroidered patch artwork (2.8\" x 3\" final size)\nThe Rewards: Membership Kit\nThe embroidered patch will ship as part of a new Yeti Squad \"membership kit\" which includes the Yeti Squad embroidered patch (2.8\" x 3\"), a 1\" Yeti-themed pin, and a Bigfoot Patrol: Yeti Squad membership card. There are also limited edition kits, which come with an artist certificate of authenticity, signed and numbered in a limited edition of 50. \nAll limited edition items will be assigned lower numbers to the higher pledge amounts, in the order received. In other words, those who pledge $100 will get lower edition number kits and prints than those who pledge $50, and so on.\nThe limited edition prints will be screen-printed by hand by Sire Press on French Brand Premium Papers at 8.5\" x 11\" size. The print will be an original, limited edition of 50 for this campaign only.\nPhotos of the actual items in the initial \"Bigfoot Patrol\" Membership Kit artist merch series. Provided to give an idea of the quality level of the final merchandise.\nThe Rewards: Levels\nThe pledge rewards are simple: I am offering four levels of reward, with some reward levels offering limited edition versions of the membership kits:\nEmbroidered Patch\nMembership Kit (Patch, Card & Pin)\nMembership Kit + signed & numbered limited edition 8.5\"x11\" print\nMembership Kit + signed & numbered limited edition 8.5\"x11\" print + original Bigfoot art (with both pencil drawing & color pencil drawing levels)\nThe limited edition kits are only available at reward levels $50, $100, $150 and $250. \nThere will be 25 limited edition kits available for the Kit + Print level, \nThere will be 25 limited edition kits available for the Kit + Print + Original Art level: 15 kits for the pencil art reward level, 10 kits for the color art reward level.\nThe highest reward level ($250) includes everything in the $150 level, plus you get the #1 signed and numbered kit and #1 signed and numbered original limited-edition print.\nMultiple Items: Add-Ons\nThere has been a lot of interest in obtaining multiple patches, buttons/pins and/or multiple kits. I've decided the best way to handle this is with add-on purchases. The way it works is simple: just add the amount of the extra items you want to your pledge. For example, if you want one kit and three patches, just add $15 to your $10 pledge and when the campaign ends (successfully, of course), the wrap-up survey will ask you what add-ons you want.\nAdd-on pricing is simple: $5 for a patch, $10 for a membership kit, $1 per button/pin. You can order up to 10 of each per Kickstarter's rules.\nBigfoot Patrol Add-Ons\nThe original limited-edition, signed and numbered Bigfoot Patrol Membership Kit series sold out, but I am making available a \"Standard Edition\" for people who missed out initially. If you want to get either a Bigfoot Patrol embroidered patch or the complete basic membership kit (patch, membership card and pin), just add on $5 per patch and/or $10 per kit to your pledge. Feel free to mix and match. And yes you can get just the button/pins for $1 each as well.\nSplit-view comparison of the final embroidered patch with the original artwork. Pretty cool, huh?\nCampaign Background\nThe Kickstarter campaign for the first \"Bigfoot Patrol\" project wasn't fully funded. But I went ahead and had the patches produced as well as a subset of the items (stickers, cards, buttons/pins) and learned a lot from both the Kickstarter process and the production and shipping process. The patches and the Bigfoot Patrol Membership Kit went over extremely well, which is why I am moving on to have the next patch created. I pretty much sold out of the initial run of 100 kits, so I will be aiming for the same amount here.\nCampaign Focus\nThis time I will be aiming a bit more directly at getting the patches made, and less on the pricier items like the t-shirts \u2014 and believe it or not, stickers. The prints and original art were popular items, so I wanted to make sure they were included despite being expensive items to ship.\nThe artwork for the \"Yeti Squad\" limited edition print. Will be silkscreen printed by hand by Sire Press on Mr. French premium paper, then signed and numbered by the artist.\nStretch Goals\nI have some ideas for stretch goal incentives to add to the kit if we hit certain goals after the campaign minimum is met. I'll be updating this with more info on those as the campaign progresses.\nThere has already been requests for window clings for your car so I think those will be the first stretch goals. Stickers are always fun so we will do a Kickstarter-exclusive Yeti silhouette sticker, and if the campaign does really well, Yeti silhouette patches!\nIf we reach $1,000: a Yeti Squad window cling will be added to the relevant backer levels*\nIf we reach $1,250: a Bigfoot Patrol window cling will be added to the relevant backer levels*\nif we reach $1,500: Yeti silhouette die-cut stickers!\nif we reach $2,500: Yeti silhouette patches!\nYeti silhouette artwork\n*Stretch goal items will only be added to those who pledge at the $25 \"Limited Edition Print\" level or higher.\nTestimonials\nCheck out these testimonials for the original \"Bigfoot Patrol\" embroidered patch and membership kit:\n\"Man those Bigfoot packages are really great. So exciting to get this today. I can't wait to give one to my buddy. He's gonna really like it. He's a huge Bigfoot buff.The badge looks even better than I thought it would. The detail is awesome.\" \u2014 John W.\n\"Received the Bigfoot Patrol kits today! Very awesome results. I'm pumped to show off my membership. Thanks and good luck!!\" \u2014 Tony P.\n\"Hey I got the stuff! Super cool. Nice quality too. Very nice. Great work George. Just great man. Outstanding.\" \u2014 Scott L.\n\"Got mine today. Wow, they're sweet! Hard to believe that one of the most quickly fulfilled, best Kickstarters I've backed was from one that didn't even reach its monetary goal. Great job, George!\" \u2014 JT\n\"Awesome stuff. As I thought the kids love the kit. Everything turned out awesome. Thanks!\" \u2014 Todd H.\n\"The quality of the kit is top notch, George.

years I have worked in the food service industry, while living in Houston, Texas I worked in restaurants, country clubs and hotels and was never really satisfied with the work. Then when i moved back to Ohio in 1991 I started working for a caterer, I loved it. I loved how she designed the food and how she was able to make the buffets so beautiful using flowers, fancy trays and bowls; I learned so much from her. Then I started working for what I would call an everyday caterer.  We did total off-site catering we would cater small and large parties,  unlike the first caterer I worked for this caterer used wire racks with disposable water pans and 1/2 pans frequently. There were times when we would fill an entire van with just 1/2 pans full of food. When we would get to the site and set everything up we would continuously refill the buffet after every 12-15 guest went through the line. It was tedious to say the least. \nWith my experience 3 1/2 pans of food would equal 1 water pan of food.\nOne day I said to myself it would be great if we could use a water pan as a food pan inside the water pan itself. The problem with that was if you put the 2 pans together the water would come out immediately from in between the pans and if you lit the sterno fuel you would burn the bottom of the food. So I thought about it off and on for a few years and could not come up with a solution. I had tried quite a few ideas but to no avail.\nThen one day about a year ago I came up with the idea that I could put a support rack in between both water pans and put water under the rack and still be able to use sterno fuel to keep the food hot.\nSupport Rack\n Then there was the issue of keeping the heat and steam between the 2 pans and not escape as it would between the gap of the pans.\nSo that's when I got the idea that what ever fabric I used it should be insulated. I thought of pot holders and what was used on the inside to allow you to pick up a hot pan and discovered insul-brite, it is the inner lining of the pot holder that repels the heat away from your hands. A thought occurred to me that since this sleeve would be used around fire, a fire retardant material would have to be used. Also the issue of food possibly being dropped onto the sleeve when people are serving themselves made me think that the material would have to be machine washable too. After gathering all these products together I found someone to make a sample sleeve for me. The sample turned out very well and at this point I knew I had the material to make my pan warmer sleeve.\nThe Pan Warmer Sleeve\nThe sleeve blends in well with the wire rack and water pans giving a clean neat appearance.\nThe next step in this process was to find a sewing house willing to take on my project. I tried a couple of places locally and they were not interested in dealing with a new project that they did not know of and if it would be worth their time . I found a woman in town and she made my initial sleeve. I went on line and found Bespoke Stitchery LLC they are located in Orlando Florida, I sent them my sample sleeve and after much communication they were able to put a pattern together for me and developed my sleeve. They called it the Pan Warmer Sleeve and that name stuck with me and I am using it for this project. \nBespoke Stitchery, Orlando Florida\nThe original racks I wanted to use were costly and as testing went on I discovered that the outer coating started peeling off after multiple uses.  I went on-line trying to find the exact size I was using but I could not. I remeasured the inside of the water pan and found a rack that was 18\"X10\" and nickle plated. This rack would fit the pan exactly and the nickle plating would handle the temperatures when in use. Then another problem showed itself, the 18\"X10\" rack sat a little higher than the previous rack so after measuring the new opening between the 2 pans  I contacted Bespoke Stitchery and explained the problem, they agreed to make a new pattern a 1/2\" wider and the problem was solved.\nThe pan warmer sleeve is almost unnoticeable when you use it on the buffet.\nNow I am ready to go forward with my plans to put my Pan Warmer Sleeve on the market.\nComplete Pan Warmer Sleeve Kit\n\"Patent Pending\"\nThis kit will consist of: 3 sleeves, 3 support racks, double drawstring bag to store your kit in and instructions of use and care . \nWith the much needed donations I plan to:\n1. Purchase the materials to make 300 sleeves or 100 kits.\n2. Purchase the 300 support racks.\n3. Purchase the large plastic double drawstring bags needed for storage of the kits.\n4. Purchase the boxes to package the kit.\n5. Pay for the advertisement page of the kit.\n6. Pay for the licenses and registrations needed to put this product on the market.\n7. Pay for the marketing aspect of this project.\n8. To acquire the shipping packaging  for the kits and satisfy the backer rewards. \nI could have never gotten this far with my project without the support of my husband Dana Rhodes. His believing in me and his encouragement kept me going when I was bumping my head against the wall trying to figure this all out.  I would like to thank my cousin Wendell Napier for the photography and the video, his patience was unmeasureable and I so appreciate his help. I would like to thank my step daughter Dan\u00e9a Rhodes for her marketing skills, the logo making and the countless hours we put in bringing this project together.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk & Challenges\n\nThe biggest challenge I feel will be getting the information out to the masses about my Pan Warmer Sleeve. Cost effective shipping of my product is requiring a great deal of thought, planning and organizing through choosing the shipping outlet, via Post Office or UPS as well as packaging materials needed to ship. I am a bit nervous about getting out there and saying, see me and what I have created. One way of getting this information out there is through the internet advertising and social media although in this area I am not very savvy, I am confident that with the help of my marketing manager we will handle this aspect of our project. We are giving our all to this project and with your help we know we will be successful. \n\nThe risk I would say is the unknown of this type of business, although I do run a successful part time concession trailer \u201cLisa\u2019s Place\u201d, which I started with no prior experience.

We have created the ultimate pair of athletic underwear for youths through adults.  Our product is so unique that we have a patent pending on it. Looks like regular underwear on the outside with our innovative technology on the inside. \nJockster is the most innovative product on the market today. Guaranteed to put the confidence back into your step during work, play and extracurriculars... all day, every day, every man, everywhere. Go get \u2019em boys! Set the world on fire!\nBad relationships happen to good people. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them...seriously.  They are so complicated. One minute everything feels all smooth and cozy, the next they\u2019re all up in your business.  You feel suffocated or the opposite\u2014totally unsupported... At the very worst, they cause major destruction in your life.\nThe only choices up till now for men to find an effective support system are not up to par. Shopping for one is like dating a girl with a questionable reputation; you may have some fun together, but nothing you want touching your goods every day. \nThe jockstrap: Nothing but a bunch of a-words: the most archaic, awkward apparatus. Invented in 1874, this...uhhh...whatever it is...hasn\u2019t evolved much. While it may do the job, it twists and rides up into places that the sun doesn\u2019t shine and...let\u2019s be honest...it\u2019s a little embarrassing to be caught with one (just like that questionable girlfriend). The only reason 20 or more companies continue to produce the jockstrap is because they are the most supportive product that currently exists. Sad story.\nCompression shorts: This devil contraption was created as an alternative to the jockstrap with many style options. However, they are soooo tight in all the wrong places. I don\u2019t think shoving my package into a saran-wrap-like fabric and feeling like a stuffed sausage is the best idea for support.\nWe deserve better. It\u2019s time to evolve. The answer, my friends, is the Jockster. The first comfortable, flattering and effective support system!\nWill be available for youth and adult, black boxer brief style. Youth size S, M, L, XL & Adult S, M, L, XL, XXL. With your help we can expand our inventory! Our goal is to quickly start producing additional colors & styles.We\u2019ve got to protect our boys!\nThe Jockster is one piece, one waistband with the comfort and style you desire in everyday use with the functional components to stay put and be supportive while exercising. No more bunching, twisting, pinching, uncomfortable straps riding up underneath your underwear. No more tightness in all the wrong places. No more embarrassing moments stopping to adjust.\nOur Story Tom Ziehler is just a typical guy... successful in life and in business, coaches a youth sports team and lives an active lifestyle. His days could get intense and he realized he was lacking a solid support system. After experimenting for years with all kinds of shapes and sizes, different characteristics, personalities, styles and colors but he was just unable to find \u201cthe one.\u201d Tom began to build his own perfect combination of support, comfort, style and functionality into an all-in-one solution to his underwear problem. Thus, the Jockster was born.\nGoal - Why we need Kickstarter Stop buying athletic shorts that don\u2019t work and start supporting your business\u2014by supporting this project. By doing so you are making a difference in men\u2019s lives everywhere. Men have suffered long enough! Life is tough enough, humankind has no idea what a man who feels fully supported can do; there is no stopping that man. Feel the support! Feel the love! Lets evolve! #Jockster #GetItOn Let\u2019s work together to make Jockster a reality\u2014I believe in this product and have personally funded it up to this point.

TWO Doorbell buttons\n3.  Power adapter\n4.  Vintage style rotary phone\nDesign\nAs with all Robomotive designs, the Doorbell Phone has simplicity of operation as the primary design objective.  The doorbell phone uses a wireless transmitter button, which is the only operator interface.  The button transmits to a receiver in the module.  The receiver signal is sent to an Adafruit Trinket, which sets the ringer and commands the phone ringer circuitry.  Analog phones operate on 35 to 70 volts DC, so bulk of the circuitry is involved in stepping up the 6V input voltage to something the phone can use.  The ringer frequency and duration is determined by the software in the Trinket, so if so inclined the savvy owner could change the ring to suit their preference.  For instance, we've had it ring using a UK standard ring in the past. \nWhat's done\nAll development costs have already been funded.  The prototype doorbell phone is currently working as the only doorbell in my house (Trick-or-Treat was fun!).  This unit uses all the same electronic components as the production unit, but on a prototype PCB.  The production PCB design is about 50% complete.  The unit is currently in a prototype enclosure, which is tucked away out of sight in my installation.  The production version will retain this small and easily hidden design.  The video above shows the actual installation in my home.  The Multi-Button versions are a little behind the others, and will be shipping slightly later.\nWhat's left to do\nFinish design of the production PCB and have units made. We also need to finish enclosure design, which will be 3d printed plastic until injection molding tooling is made.  All of these items will be complete prior to the end of this campaign.\nFunding\nRemaining funding requirements for this project are relatively modest, and mostly consist of volume pricing for components. A 3d printer is also planned for the early component cases, most of the cost of which will be funded from other sources.\nGift Giving\nClearly we won't be shipping by Christmas or Chanukah, but you can still give the Doorbell Phone as a gift.  If funding is successful early enough we can send a printed gift card on request.  If we go down to the wire we can send the card digitally.  Here's our draft graphic below:\nGift Giving Card", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe tasks remaining required to complete the production version of the doorbell phone are well understood and relatively simple. The prototype versions utilizes all of the electrical components of the production version, but has a hand built circuit board and prototype enclosure. In the case of the multi-button versions the microcontroller may change to a smaller version as well. The production printed circuit board (PCB) design is nearly complete, and vendor quotes have been included in cost estimates. The final production enclosure will be injection molded plastic, but early units will be 3d printed. Let us know what you'd like it to look like! \n\nFunding from this campaign is required to order the first batch of PCBs and a 3d printer for the first batch of enclosures. Our pricing depends on a certain volume, and once our funding goal is reached will send volume orders to our suppliers. Our longest lead supplier is 3 weeks, so productions units are expected to be ready shortly after he close of the campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Doorbell Phone 2.0 is Live now!", "update_content": "Miss your chance to get the Doorbell Phone when it was still in production?

I set out to Columbus, Ohio where I found a new home, new friends and a launching pad for my music career! Within a month of making my move, I set out on a 26 day/City/Show marathon tour of the East coast, north to south including Canada! I made so many new friends and memories that continue to inspire me to keep going and to believe that each day is a new opportunity to live your dream.

Also the pizza cooks differently depending on the toppings. A pepperoni will produce oil which speeds up the cooking process. Another example would be having loaded the pizza with every topping you can think of, and they all act like insulators preventing the cheese as well as the other topping from cooking correctly with a normal grill. The only solution for a normal grill would be to cook it longer. But time and time again people try to cook everything through and end up burning the crust. Because simply with a normal grill, you can not cook toppings through without burning the crust. This grill is designed to be able to cook everything a normal grill can, except it funnels heat up and keeps it suspended.

The doctor's fancy camera recently broke and he was preparing to ask the client to come back in a few weeks.  He then remembered the awesome new Easy-Macro lens he had just purchased.  He produced his Easy-Macro and captured a photo of the patient's eye in just seconds, saving the client from the hassle of returning to the office.  Stories like this are a huge reason why my team and I have continued to work hard to make Easy-Macro the best, most convenient macro lens on the market.\nHere are a few more ways our customers are using their Easy-Macros:\nTake incredible up-close photos of everyday objects\nShow kids the tiny details in the world around them\nTeach up-close photography in schools\nRecord plants and insects for ecological field studies\nKeep records of dermatological concerns\nShow of their amazing manicure art\nPhotograph fine details in jewelry and crafts\nInspect electronics\nThe uses for Easy-Macro are only limited by your imagination!  Use it to explore the world around you and you'll be amazed at what you discover.\nThe Lenses\nWe have already completed the mold designs for our 2x and 4x lenses.  The new additions to the Easy-Macro family will be just as high quality as our current product.  \nCheck out the results:\nIn fact, thanks to the custom lens design made possible by last year's campaign, we have increased our 30 day 100% refund guarantee to 90 days!  If absolutely anything goes wrong with your Easy-Macro within 90 days of purchase, we'll send you a new one or refund your money.  \nWitness The Difference\nDon't just take our word for it, check out these awesome examples of what Easy-Macro can do!\nSunflower 4x\nScrew 4x\nEye 4x Instagram Credit: @54r4ii\nEye 4x Instagram Credit: @phobalob\nStink Bug 4x Instagram Credit: @amchu\nManicure Art 4x Instagram Credit: @boatmate\nBee 4x Instagram Credit: @hauntedinautumn\nDragonfly Wing 4x Instagram Credit: @jedidiahpeters\nKitten Nose 4x Instagram Credit: @karindodge27\n There are just too many to share!

As I was making them, I thought to myself, buckeye candies are very good, I can only eat 1 or 2. But they are really boring, how can I give them a \"face-lift\"?  I asked if I could play with the flavors.  The first creation was born \"Hazelnut Cream\".  Original buckeyes infused with Hazelnut liqueur and hazelnut fudge.  The second creation was born \"Coconut Paradise\".  Original buckeye infused with fresh coconuts and coconut milk.  I brought them to work and everyone loved them.

Well now you can!  Introducing the all new Game Gate: Gameroom Edition. \nStill with me?  Good, then lets talk potatoes and meat.  This isn't your grandmother's arcade machine or some cheap furniture with a home game console inside.  Game Gate represents huge leaps forward in how games are played.  Originally designed to be coin-operated, this amazing machine is being upgraded to GAMEROOM EDITION. This campaign is all about adding a revolutionary arcade panel and tweaking the system for free play, and at a price only available to those willing to help us launch through Kickstarter!\nSo let\u2019s talk for a minute about the new arcade panel. There\u2019s a lot of buttons and joysticks on today\u2019s handheld controllers. The Game Gate commercial quality arcade panel has you covered. Each player features a classic style 8-way D-stick, 10 analog arcade buttons (they still click and function as digital and analog), and an analog joystick. All of this is mounted to a reverse printed Lexan panel that is scratch and spill resistant. We have also added a 4-way ball style joystick for those wanting an authentic classic experience on games like Galaga, Pac-Man, and Dig Dug that work best without diagonal movements. This is a great control panel and will work with Xbox 360 or PC. Check out our single player version if you want a similar feel without the cabinet.\nSo what is a Game Gate?\nGame Gate is way more than an Xbox 360 in a cabinet.  As mentioned, the machines were the world's first and only licensed for public use home console based arcade.  The Xbox game console is controlled by a custom developed control board that switches video between an integrated PC and the game console.  Power and USB functions are directly controlled by the system, and game play is in a charge-by-time configuration.  Time remaining and custom messages are displayed in the LED matrix housed in the backlit marquee.  Color changing LEDs on the sides and front of the cabinet change to attract players.  A powerful sound system with ear level speakers and a powered subwoofer make any game sound incredible, and the games look stunning on the 32\u201d LCD.  There\u2019s a ton of extra features on the machine that make it very unique.  There are two headphone jacks on the front of the machine with separate volume control.  There are illuminated pushbuttons for player selection and system reset.  There is a video out on the back of the machine so you can use a shadow monitor (so if you have big screen TV in your gameroom, hook it up to the Game Gate and play from either screen).  There are casters on the bottom of the machine for easy moving and leg levelers for stable play.  \n\"The list goes on and on... no other universal arcade touches it.\"\nIf you are the tech savy/maker type and want to do some tweaks, it is quite easy to modify the system to run emulators and front ends such as Hyperspin on the onboard PC. Imagine customizing the LED matrix to display the game titles, creating your own front end, etc.  Definitely consider the standard editon here, because you won't need the XBox 360. \nIf you have ever wanted to spice up your game room, the new Game Gate: Gameroom Edition is a guaranteed winner. The ability to play classic and newer generation games means there is always a game someone will love. So enough reading already, spread the word, pledge if you can, and GAME ON! Seriously, your dream gameroom just called and wants this for Christmas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project involves pulling together a labor force for the final assembly, integration, and testing. We have over 100 of the (unmodified) machines brand new, sealed and in a box. We plan to open every unit and thoroughly test and review every part before and after we make the modifications. We do make the components and electronics, so we are equipped to replace any component that is not 100% (and provide service or replacement parts for any unit that we ship). The biggest challenge for us is to fulfill all the orders as quickly as possible because we are eager to launch another campaign for a new product we have been working on for over a year. \nWe fabricate the single player control panels by hand, including the thermo-formed base. These units take hours of painstaking attention to detail to build, and we only have a few people qualified for the work. If we sell a lot of them (and hopefully we do!), it could take a few months to fulfill all the orders. Also, we do have a limited inventory on hand of the circuit boards that connect the joysticks/buttons to the game console. If we have a demand beyond several hundred units, we will need to do another production run of the boards to complete the orders. This could add up to 12 weeks from the day we place our order to completing the product. We promise to advise backers before the end of the campaign if pre-sales are beyond our current inventory and any schedule impacts.

Want to still get a Beluga Razor & Save? \nJust head over to www.belugashave.com and Pre-Order Today!\nPRESS WALL:\n\u7ffb\u8a33\u3092\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046GIGAZINE\u3002\n           Independent Razor Review\nIndependent Razor Review\nBasically, if you want a better quality shaving experience, want to save money, and help save the planet (the blades can be recycled! No waste!). Then this razor sounds like it\u2019s for you.\n*NEW VIDEO* Beluga Razor in action + comparison (Please excuse the low-quality)\n*NEW IMAGE* Comparison of Beluga Razor and DE razor\nBy using an innovative and open design, the Beluga Razor stands alone when compared with others:\nA SINGLE EXPOSED EDGE\nA Professional\u2019s preferred choice that is now available in a user friendly design for the first time ever with the patent pending Beluga Razor. Professional Barbers take years to gain the muscle memory to maintain the ideal cutting angle of a single edged razor, but with the Beluga you gain these years of experience instantly.\nMost people don't realize the amazing experience of shaving with a single edge, mainly because of the large learning curve typically associated with them (unless they just aren't aware).  However, that all changes today, because the Beluga Razor virtually eliminates this learning curve, thanks to its pivoting neck, so you can shave with ease for the first time ever.  If you can use a Gillette Razor; you can use the Beluga Razor the same way.\nSuch a unique and open design saves you thousands of dollars in the long-term because of the use of substantially lower priced replacements blades of your choice that can cost as low as 10\u00a2 per blade!\nPREMIUM MATERIALS\nHEAD/NECK: \nWe use 316L Stainless Steel for your Beluga Razor so it is incredibly durable and heavily weighted for easy shaving, while also looking and feeling incredible when compared with other razors that now just look like cheap substitutes.  This steel requires zero maintenance, virtually forever, thanks to its high degree of corrosion resistance, so just enjoy.\nHANDLE: \nWith the Beluga Razor we designed our handle to be a little bit larger and longer than usual to provide a nice and relaxing shave, but still retain the versatility to use multiple hand positions with ease and greater comfort.  The handle material that was carefully selected is Linen Micarta. Linen Micarta is a premium plastic used by many premium knife handle makers because it is extremely durable and actually creates a better grip when wet. Known as the \"Cadillac of Plastics\", the feel of this handle is truly unique, and just like the razor, it must be used to truly appreciate. The feel is warm and organic, and overtime it will even darken with age to represent the generations of use you will get out of it.  Each colored batch of Micarta is unique and will vary overtime, making your razor truly unique.  The handle colors available are Tuxedo Black, Hunter Green, and Bourbon Burgundy (aka maroon).\nPIVOTING NECK: \nA pivoting neck is a simple and easy solution to make single edge shaving incredibly easy for the first time.  With the Beluga Razor we wanted your razor to have a high degree of pivot, but we recognized from the beginning that the pivot point would be the weakest feature. Accordingly, we spent a lot of time to make it one of the strongest features possible so it can help you reach those hard to reach areas and eliminate excessive pressure.\nMAGNET:\nWe at Beluga recognized the ability to achieve a better quality shave with a single edge, but we wanted to make sure your entire experience with our razor was easy and safe when in use.  Accordingly, we recognized early on that picking up a thin razor blade from your counter was extremely hard, thus we added a magnet to easily pick up a razor blade from a flat surface to keep you safe and make things that much easier!\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR SHAVE + SAVE \nWhich will you choose?\nBeluga is simply interested in providing you the best shaving tool, and not charging you an arm and leg for proprietary razor blades. For the first time you now have the ability to choose from 70+ different double edge blades available from manufacturers all over the world. They differ in metal composition, blade sharpness, and even the type of low friction coating applied, if any.  This allows you to find the perfect blade that best suits your skin and budget. Just look at how much you can save in the long-run below!  #expectmore\nDouble edge razor blades are the lowest priced blades in the world, thanks to their ease of manufacturing and standardized form.  Costing as little at 10\u00a2 each, this allows you to pay back the Beluga Razor in less than two and half years.  When have you ever had a razor that pays for itself!  This means you can save over a thousand dollars in the long run!  These blades generally last for 3-7 shaves on your face (depending on how thick your hair is), but last far longer for shaving your body where the hair is thinner and your skin is tougher.\n60 Day Return Policy!\nIF YOU DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU GET IT...RETURN IT! Typically Kickstarter campaigns do not have return policies, but we at Beluga felt it was worth it to provide a low risk way to try a truly unique shaving experience. Accordingly, we created a 60 day, no-questions-asked return policy starting on the day you receive the razor. However, your razor must be returned in like-new condition and any dents, excessive wear, or other damage will cause your product not to be allowed to be returned. \nNOTE: You can only ask for a refund AFTER receiving the product in the mail and you will have to pay for shipping back to us (the razor is very small and light so it's not that much).  For full details on the return process go to http://www.belugashave.com/terms-and-conditions/\nNO CLOGGED OR DIRTY RAZOR ANYMORE\n The Beluga Razor is designed to easily remove any and all hair with a simple rinse.  Additionally, because it is made from 316L Stainless Steel, you can easily clean the razor with ease.  Who designs a razor that gets clogged everytime?  That's just annoying.\nGREENEST PIVOTING RAZOR ON THE PLANET!\nAll pivoting razors currently on the market rely on cheap, plastic cartridge blades that have to be thrown into the garbage and cannot be recycled since they are a mix of plastic and metal that are too small and labor intensive to disassemble. This leads to hundreds of millions being thrown out every month!  With the Beluga Razor, you can recycle your double edge razor blades since they are pure metal. Additionally, since our razor was built to last, there should practically be zero waste.  This makes the Beluga Razor the greenest pivoting razor on the planet! (See our FAQ about how to recycle razor blades) #expectmore\nHold up, you mean to tell me that not only will the Beluga Razor give me a better quality shave, but it will also save me a considerable amount of money even compared to so called low cost competitors?  AND I can help the planet at the same time?  YES, now you are getting it!  We hope you are excited about this product just as much as we are to bring it to you!\n25 YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY\nWe wanted to ensure that when you purchase the Beluga Razor that you are as confident about the quality of our razor as we are.  So we provided a 25 year guarantee to ensure you never need worry.  Either way, everything on the Beluga Razor is easily repaired or replaced.  For more specific information please view the \"Legal\" page on our website at www.belugashave.com.\nHOW IT WORKS\nWe are working on making the Beluga Razor as easy and safe to use as possible to ensure you are confident when using it.  You just:\n1. OPEN UP THE HEAD \n2. INSERT ANY DOUBLE EDGE BLADE\n 3. LOCK IT DOWN \nCurrently, we are using a brass thumbscrew that you twist on, but we are working on several more user friendly designs we know you will appreciate!\nPATENT PENDING\nWhen we first conceived the idea for the Beluga Razor, we knew we had hit upon something truly unique.  Accordingly, we are seeking patent protection worldwide to ensure a standard and high quality product is delivered to your door\nWEIGHTED HEAD\nWe found that placing more weight into the head of our pivoting razor is where the experience of the shave really improved since one does not feel the need to press any harder since they can simply let the head do the work. This takes a lot of stress both out of your hands and your face and allows for a more comfortable shaving experience.  If you are a hardcore DE user, trust us, we were just as skeptical as you are (SHOUT OUT TO: badger&blade + wickededge)\nDESIGNED TO BE SEEN\nThe Beluga Razor was designed from the beginning to be something that you can be proud to leave out and display. Most people hide their razor simply because they are ugly, cheap, or full of grime since they are difficult to clean. We want to be, and would be honored to be, the distinct voice in your bathroom that says you are unique, think for the long-term, and value quality without having to say anything at all.\nTRAVEL FRIENDLY \nEven when on the go you want a high quality shave and with the Beluga Razor this is what you get. Many places all over the world generally don\u2019t have replacement blades for some of the higher cost competitors like we have in America, but they generally do have a wide assortment of double edge razor blades that will work with the Beluga Razor. Thus, no matter where you travel you can be assured you will have a plentiful supply of blades to choose from.  Just be aware that double edge blades cannot be carried onto a plane and must be checked.\nMADE IN USA\nFrom the beginning we wanted to make this product in the USA with American companies and American workers.  Accordingly, we have reached out to many USA manufacturers who are eager to help us make a high quality product that can be quickly delivered to your door without the usual delays other crowdfunded products run into when sourcing from overseas.  \nSTRETCH GOALS \nMore backers means more options and even free gifts! So please help spread the word in order to ensure you get all the options we have to offer!\n$150,000 Stretch Goal Reward!\nIf we can get the campaign up to $150,000 in pre-orders than EVERY razor ordered will receive 5 free PREMIUM blades.  Just our way of saying thanks, and to make sure you can immediately use the razor when you get it.\n$250,000 Stretch Goal Reward\n                    FREE TRAVEL CASE\n We will reveal what the travel case looks like at $200,000, but it's really nicely designed and can store a pack of blades for travel.  Normally it would retail for $25.\nOTHER STRETCH GOALS ARE FURTHER DOWN THE LINE.\nPRODUCTION & DELIVERY PLAN\nHere's a basic breakdown of our plan to get the Beluga Razor produced:\nOctober - Finalizing form/dimensions, Sourcing Components, Finalizing Manufacturers, Developing Packaging\nNovember - Finalizing form/dimensions, Sourcing Components, Finalizing Manufacturers, Developing Packaging\nDecember - Finalizing form/dimensions, Develop Tooling Molds, Finalize Packaging\nJanuary - Refine Tooling Molds\nFebruary - Refine Tooling Molds\nMarch - Test Runs on Tooling Molds\nApril - Final Test Runs and Final Approvals for Tooling Mold\nMay - Start Production, Assembly, and Packaging for Shipping.\nJune - Buffer Month, unlike others that expect things to go as scheduled, we want to plan on delays and thus included 2 buffer months.\nJuly - Another Buffer Month and Shipping\nWHO ARE WE YOU ASK?\nZac Wertz - The founder and CEO of Beluga Shave Co.  He is an Attorney with an MBA and background in Finance from Cincinnati, Ohio.  Taking a detailed oriented approach from his legal career and applying it toward designing the Beluga Razor.  He is creating a better shaving tool not only for you, but himself and he won't stop till he is absolutely sure when you open the box that your mind will be blown!\nREST OF TEAM:\nThe rest of the team is made up of high level independent industrial designers and mechanical engineers that have been hand selected to be just as passionate as Zac is!  We just can't currently disclose who for confidentiality reasons.  We can share that the initial design and prototype was made with the help of the talented design team at Trident Designs (trident-design.com) in Columbus, Ohio!\nANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP?\nAfter you support us, we would love if you helped spread the word.

We want to be as responsive as possible, but depending on the volume of people this obviously can pose some issues.  Still, we hate crowdfunding projects that are not responsive so we promise to be as responsive as possible to ensure you are satisfied. Responsive, haha.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelivering the perfect shaving tool is our focus; and we would like to be open and honest with you as we make progress.\n\nWe designed the Beluga Razor from the beginning to be as relatively simple as possible to manufacture in order to quickly deliver to your door the best shaving experience of your life. We have been working on the Razor for well over 2 years. Nothing on the Razor is overly complicated and was purposefully built to be robust, last for generations, and be straight forward to manufacture.\n\nOUR CHALLENGES:\n\nProduct Changes: The Razor is in a final form for production, but small changes may be needed to both ensure we manufacture a consistent/reliable product and to further enhance the quality of the shave given.\n\nChoice of Factory: In the USA we have a wide selection of quality manufacturers to choose from that we are currently in talks with. When making any hardware product there will be a number of challenges to getting it just right and it will be important to take the time to ensure our factory partners understand and can meet our high quality standards, while also being large enough to scale.\n\nQuality Control (QC): High QC is a major focus of ours as we want the Beluga Razor to be a cherished product of yours for the rest of your life. Through the use of dedicated QC personnel and specialized QC equipment we know we can exceed your expectations and deliver a consistent and high quality product that you will appreciate every time you shave.\n\nDelays: Delays tend to be a natural occurrence of manufacturing hardware and we promise to be transparent and upfront about any impact on the ship date. By manufacturing in the USA we can avoid lengthy shipping lead times and costs in order to deliver you your Beluga Razor as quickly as possible and efficiently as possible. We even have built in extra time to account for potential delays in order to meet our shipment date, but with life there is always a chance that things will take longer than planned and we will let you know if this is the case.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "September Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers, \nFrom our last update we talked about finalizing the design and getting re-quoted from various vendors to start production. In this update we plan on explaining what happened since that time, where we are now, and then finally give a detailed step by step plan towards production and ultimately shipment of your Beluga Razor. \n The process for deciding on and locking down vendors took a bit longer than anticipated as we actually had to switch a few things around in regards to who we anticipated working with and where things were going to be made. We were finally able to engage with select vendors here in the United States that would best be able to hit our tolerances, speed to production, and price points for production. The most critical vendor selected was our Metal Injection Molding (MIM) vendor who would build the tooling and manufacture the critical metal parts that will precisely hold the blade. This one vendor\u2019s timeline alone is what dictates the time to ship because it involves the creation of a tool from hardened steel that will be used in manufacturing the main critical metal parts of the Beluga Razor. Here is an image of the one of the tools for the neck in CAD form that has been confirmed and will be cut into a steel tool. "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "May Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nWe recognize that we\u2019ve been a little delayed in communicating what has been going on, thus we want to bring you up to speed with this update about us finalizing the design for production and progressing forward. In our last update we told you that we have locked in the blade position, but that we wanted to shrink the size of the head because the largeness was causing issues for some people when shaving in tight areas. This was a bit of a challenge to shrink this area, and as we were doing this our designer realized the potential for a vastly better latching mechanism (shown below) to replace the thumbscrew. It was so much better and straightforward that we decided to take the time to go through with the change since we were still shrinking the size of the head. In addition, we wanted to wait on sending out an update until we received the finalized metal prototypes with this design to confirm that this was the design we were going to go with. We didn\u2019t want to add to any confusion with our direction just in case this design ended up not working."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "February Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nWe know it\u2019s been a couple months since our last update and we wanted to explain why there has been a delay in communication, highlight our progress to date, and explain the next steps. \nIn the last update we had just made approximately 8 prototypes for consumer testing. This took a while to perform because it was right during the holidays, but by January we were able to gather all the results. "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "November Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers, \nWe just got in some new prototypes to do some larger scale shave testing to do final testing before production begins. Beluga has been taking part in a local hardware accelerator here In Cincinnati, Ohio called First Batch (www.firstbatch.org) and after achieving a more finalized design we have discussed with our advisors that it would be best to do a somewhat larger testing phase with a larger variety of unfamiliar users before running a production run. The shaving performance so far has exceeded our expectations for a smooth and close shave, but we just want to ensure this translates to a larger variety of unfamiliar users. Accordingly, we are creating 2 test batches of razors before completely finalizing the design and moving towards production that we have stated in our prior update will take approximately 20-22 weeks and thus initially pushes us until Q2 of 2016 to be able to ship the razors. "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "September Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nWe have been doing extensive testing in plastic form to finalize the bottom surface of the head of the razor where the blade is exposed.  We are excited because we have found a form that has eliminated the nicking issue that some testers have been experiencing.  This took time because we had to work with the varied elasticity of the skin of different users.  Those with thicker skin never have had any real issues, thus we are primarily working with more sensitive skinned individuals to ensure we were completely confident before moving forward with a metal prototype version.  We are finalizing the current form in metal in 1-2 weeks to confirm these changes, but there could still be some slight adjustments/testing that we want to do to ensure absolute confidence in the design before production.  This could entail making 10-30 metal prototypes with subtle adjustments to the bottom surface, having a larger set of  25-50+ testers provide their feedback, and then evaluating the best bottom surface to lock in for production. "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "August Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nRight away we want to say that our push for a September shipment is not going to be feasible and we will have to delay until a to be determined shipment date.  A couple of things hindered our ability to reach this goal and we will also explain below why the shipment date is to be determined.\nFirst, our prototype vendor incorrectly machined a critical area on one portion of the razor as we have stated before, and this led to an unacceptable shave.  We were the ones who selected this vendor, thus we will certainly take the blame.  However, this is not an ordinary prototype machine shop.  This machine shop specializes in very tight tolerances and complex geometry, and was why they were ultimately chosen.  Plus, they were the only ones to guarantee our tolerances versus just offering best efforts.  This resulted in them reworking the flawed parts for free, but we first had to figure out exactly what went wrong.  However, given the tight tolerances involved one cannot simply just measure the part using hand tools.  Rather, this required us to perform metrology on the part which involved laser scanning the surface in order to compare it with our CAD data to see where the metal parts were off.  Below is one of the laser scans for you to see (please note that we pixelated the critical area, but anything dark blue is way off).  The flawed area where the blade is exposed out the bottom resulted in the blade being distorted at the cutting edge and increasing the cutting angle beyond acceptable levels.  "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "June Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nWe got metal versions of the razor in last week, and the razor looks great so we wanted to share some images below of what the Beluga Razor looks like in metal form.  Unfortunately, there is an issue with the metal version that is leading to infrequent nicks/cuts that wasn't present in prior prototypes.  It shaves very well, but based on our prior shaving experience we can feel that something is off.  We believe the issue lies with the razor blade edge being distorted because of an error when CNC machining it, but when we are talking about subtle differences in microns it is hard to immediately measure and pin point the issue.  Accordingly, we are working with a Metrology company to laser scan the razor to see how and where it might deviate from our CAD data in order to pin point the issue."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "May Update #2", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nWe wanted to send out an update with a few of things we have just gotten in and quickly share these with you all.\nFinal Metal Verification (Coming Soon!)\nWe mentioned that the final metal verification razor will be coming in soon and we were able to get the vendor to supply a picture of it while it was in the machine a day ago.  This version is CNC machined via a high accuracy 5 axis machine, but the final production version will not be CNC machined like this.  The reason why it even took this long is because first the Beluga Razor has some very high tolerances making it difficult to even find a vendor who could meet them, and secondly every vendor has lead times of work already scheduled ahead of when they could even fit our razor in.  "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "May Update", "update_content": "Hey Backers,\nWe wanted to update you on where we are at and also layout our revised timeline to give you a better perspective.  We have finalized the design, have created 2d prints and tolerance info for all the parts, and are working with our final select few vendors, most of whom we have been in discussion with since last year about this project.  As soon as final vendor selections and tolerances are finalized we can start setting up  for production.  Just be aware that after selecting the final vendors that there is still a long lead time for this stage, and this is the reason why we had to push shipping back until September.  This razor is a precision tool with very precise tolerances, and this just takes time to accomplish."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "March Update!", "update_content": "Hey Backers- \nWe have several things to mention in this update, but the most important of which is that shipping is most likely going to be delayed by 2 months until September 2015. We know this is the last thing you want to hear and we will work hard to make this time up, but the reason for this delay is because we discovered that our design firm incorrectly modeled how the blade curved resulting in the incorrect blade angle being applied to the razor. We hoped to have a final design earlier, but this recent unplanned revelation ended up requiring the razor head to be redesigned because of this error. We have been delaying an update because of these issues so that we delivered you the final solution to this problem, and we are pretty excited with what we came up with both from a design and functional stand point. We actually think everything ended up for the better in all aspects with this redesign, except for the slight delay of course, to ensure you get the best razor and shave possible since the increased blade angle would have resulted in a harsher shave. Below are quick snapshots of the new razor design, and we hope to share images of this new design in metal form in a few weeks.

A dedicated motion capture system enables each controller-half to know exactly where it is in the room. It uses this information to add motion play to unmodified consoles and PCs while preserving the use of standard buttons and sticks.\nSee some shotgun frenzied action in Titanfall!\nSkyrim on First Generation Prototype\nThe Mad Genius Controller uses a new patented technology to know where you are down to 1/100th of an inch! Any move you make is accurately tracked. Other \"motion\" controls that use cameras and accelerometers don't have this accuracy and can't provide this level of motion play.\nThe Mad Genius Controller is designed to look and feel familiar to gamers. The controller acts as a traditional controller when it's together. When split, it adds high definition motion gaming. All buttons and sticks still work EVEN WHEN MOTION IS ACTIVE. Play with conventional buttons and sticks, motion, or even use both at the same time.\n\nThe Mad Genius Controller works out of the box with any title you buy or already own and with any console or PC.  It doesn't require modifications to the game software or to the console hardware.  It is not a \u201cproof of concept\u201d awaiting the development of new games. It needs no patches to work with existing PC titles. Choose a Game Profile to match your game and add precision motion.  It's that simple.\nIs it wireless?\nWe have received several questions about the wires shown in the videos. The wires are there to provide power to the controller and carry traditional button presses back to the console. The controller shipped to backers will be 100% wireless. Wireless communications to a console is easy. We just do not have the space inside the current prototype to house batteries and our custom circuitry. Kickstarter funding will enable us to shrink our custom hardware to a chipset, freeing up the space to accommodate the batteries and the standard wireless modules.\nIt was important to us to demonstrate the unprecedented accuracy of the NEW technology, which is the absolute positioning system you have seen in the videos.\nCES 2014\n\nWhy Would I want one?\nYou can use it with any game and console, even the ones you already own\nNo waiting on special titles to be developed for it\nYou can use this ONE controller on all your consoles\nIts Ergonomic. When split apart the controller is much more comfortable than a traditional controller\nIt adds 1/100th of an inch precision aiming, pointing and moving to your game\nUse motion for in-game actions such as reload, melee, open doors, pick things up and more\nYour game character can move with you, walking, ducking and sidestepping right along with you\nProgram button combinations into an easily remembered motion\nFinal Version will be wireless\nWorks with head mounted displays\nThis one device gives you the features of a:\nStandard Controller\nMotion Controller\nSteering Wheel\nFlight Stick\nMod Enabled Controller\nBut takes up the space of a traditional controller!!\nDid we say it works with all your existing games???\nOh - And we have AWESOME T-Shirts too!\nHow does it work?\nThe Absolute Positioning System\nA dedicated motion capture system determines the absolute position of each half of the controller in 3D space in a 12ft by 15ft playing area\nDetermines acceleration and velocity based on changes in position\nTracks your motion with 1/100th of an inch (.25mm) accuracy with no drift.\nUse it when standing, moving around or sitting on the couch\n      No Hardware Modifications Needed\nPlug the Mad Genius Controller into the standard console controller port with provided console adapters\nWorks plug and play with head mounted displays like Oculus, as well as desktop PCs\nWe have compiled a series of short explanation videos on our website that cover how the controller works in more detail. Check out the : Mad Genius Controllers Chapter Videos\nThe Profile Designer\nA \"Game Profile\" customizes motions to match the game. The Profile Designer allows you to create, edit and share game profiles with the Mad Genius Controller online community. Don't like the motions we designed for your game? Change them. Don't see a design for your game? You can create one and share it.\nThe Profile Designer can be run locally on your PC / laptop or tablet, or via most browser enabled devices.\nUse the Profile Designer to:\nDownload Game Profiles from the web community\nUse Game Profiles as they are or change them to make them yours\nBuild new profiles from scratch and share with other players via the cloud\nFollow authors of your favorite profiles and rate their profiles\nThe Mad Genius Controller gives you more than pin point aiming and motion control. Split the controller in half and it morphs into:\nA Steering Wheel\nA Flight Stick and Throttle\nA Bow\nA Horses Reigns\nA Dragon\u2019s Wings\nA Sword and Shield\nAnd so much more ...\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are a small team and we've taken the project as far as we can part time. The next step is to take the product to production. For that we need your help.\nOur goal is to provide a high quality, well tested and durable product to you and that requires time and resources to do it right. The patented tracking technology is a completely new innovation.  It takes more resources to deliver something that hasn't been done before. That's why we're here.\nProduct Timelines - Our Journey So Far\nProduct Next Steps with Your Support\n\nWill there be a Development Kit?\nYES! Development Kits will be available!\nThe first is aimed at Game developers and game studios.  The second is for hobbyists who want to use the tracking technology in other applications.\n\nGamer Dev Kit:\nWe didn't want to bring you a device with only promises of the future and we didn't want to build a device that was limited to only the games of yesterday and today. The Gamer Dev Kit gives a developer access to every bit of tracking, velocity and acceleration data that the controller creates.  True one-to-one control between your hands and the game will be possible for swords, light sabers, moving objects, moving around, and anything else you can imagine.\n\nTech Dev Kit:\nMany people have expressed an interest in the amazing accuracy of the Mad Genius Controller's location tracking technology for other, non-gaming applications. The Tech Dev Kit has been designed to satisfy the hobbyist and those wanting to explore what can be done with 1/100th of an inch location tracking. In addition to the controller and APIs you will also take delivery of additional tracking markers and all the info you need to get you started.\n\nMore details of both of these kits can be found on our website at:\n- http://www.madgeniuscontrollers.com/devkits.aspx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mad Genius Controller uses new technology that has never before been brought to market. We have already overcome the challenges of transforming an idea of motion gaming into a working proof-of-concept design. We are confident that we can take this to the next level.\n\nMad Genius Controllers has a small capable team but we are by no means alone. We have built relationships with suppliers and manufacturers here in the USA as well as overseas in Hong Kong and Singapore. Their support enabled us to demonstrate at CES 2014 and has given us access to additional technology to make our first consumer prototype even better.\n\nWe are confident we have the right team to complete this project but there are always risks to manage:\n\n\u2022 The prototype's hardware design will be cleaned up and miniaturized\n\u2022 New software must be designed, written and tested\n\u2022 Hardware components must be sourced while controlling costs\n\u2022 Plastic components must be designed, fabricated and tested for comfort and usability\n\u2022 The hardware and software responsible for (x,y,z) tracking will be engineered into a single chip\n\u2022 A system must be set up for final assembly and quality testing of each unit\n\u2022 A system must be established for Shipping and Receiving\n\nWe will update our supporters every step of the way.

The bar was set very high because, unfortunately, that's what it would take to produce something like this properly.\nDespite that it's still been a good experience.  Several OEMs are interested in the tracking technology that makes the controller work.  They're looking into using the tracking technology in other, non-gaming applications.\nMuch of the cost of the controller was in the expense of reducing all of the electronics down to a manageable size.

Director/Producer, Jon Schnitzer, hopes you share his vision to make HAUNTERS the best it can be:\nHAUNTERS is a documentary for all you haunted house fans, who have to get your \u201cscare-apy\u201d this time of year!\nA life-long fan of Halloween and all things horror, Jon Schnitzer (co-owner of The Brain Factory & HAUNTERS Director/Producer) was inspired to document the world of haunting as it becomes increasingly mainstream and spawns a whole new wave of extreme - sometimes controversial full-contact - entertainment.  And, he was curious to explore what is driving the boom in demand for the wild spectrum of interactive horror experiences that have proliferated in recent years.\nOver the last year, we gained exclusive access to some of the most popular, theatrical and infamous haunts in America - like Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights, Knott\u2019s Scary Farm, Delusion, Blackout and McKamey Manor, to name just a few.  We also have shot hundreds of hours of behind-the-scenes and personal footage of a fascinating cast of characters, including professional and home-haunters, their families, the monsters and the fans who love them. \nIf you're one of the >32 million Americans who will attend a haunted house this year, we know you will appreciate the passion and professionalism that have gone into making HAUNTERS The Movie!\nEvery dollar raised will help make HAUNTERS a better movie!\nWe\u2019ve accomplished a lot with HAUNTERS so far, but we still have a lot of work ahead of us to finish the film\u2026 and we will have to make a lot of tough decisions where to cut corners if we don\u2019t get some outside funding to help.  \nIf we don't make our Kickstarter campaign goal, all the pledges will be refunded to our backers and we will get $0.  Kickstarter's rule is all-or-nothing - scary!So, while we continue to devote our own resources and time to completing HAUNTERS by next fall, we hope you are inspired to kick in!\nWhen you back HAUNTERS, you\u2019ll be supporting must-have essentials to finish the film:\nEDITING \u2013 Jon has had every intention from the start, to edit HAUNTERS himself. Everyone knows the real storytelling of cinema happens in the editing room and telling the haunters\u2019 stories is what inspired him to make HAUNTERS in the first place. However, we will need to hire an assistant editor(s) to help organize and cut the hundreds of hours of footage that was shot over the last year, as well as to help compile and overlay all the footage/photos the haunters gave us rights to include.  Our goal is to finish HAUNTERS in time to submit to film festivals, so we can get the broadest exposure possible...\nAUDIO \u2013 We are extremely lucky to have the score and the music for HAUNTERS already covered, and by some amazing talents. However, we will need to hire a Sound Engineer to level-out the footage audio, to match the caliber of our soundtrack. All the different locations we wanted to include in HAUNTERS ended up generating a lot of variability in the sound quality. And, as you can imagine, the sound tracks from recording inside the haunts will take some significant tweaking due to all the screaming...\nARCHIVAL FOOTAGE/IMAGES \u2013 We need rights to include some copyrighted footage/images that will help tell the story of how haunted houses have evolved over the years and highlight media coverage of the controversies some haunters have had to face, from protests to shut-downs...\nVOICE OVER (VO) NARRATION \u2013 The storylines of HAUNTERS will be told by the haunters themselves, their families and fans. However, every documentary needs a great professional VO talent. We have VO options in mind, but the final choice will come down to who/what we can afford...\nINTERVIEWS \u2013 We\u2019re shooting HAUNTERS now (as you read this!) and will continue shooting into early 2015. It\u2019s impossible to include every haunt, but we want to interview a few more cutting-edge haunters and experts to help shed light on why we love to scare and be scared, the therapeutic value of screaming your head off and the primal need for that rush of \u2018survival\u2019 adrenaline.  The final choices will come down to who/what we can afford in terms of travel and local equipment/crews...\nHAUNTERS will premiere next Oct 2015, one way or another - the final version of the movie is up to you!  Plus, when you back HAUNTERS, you\u2019ll get to choose from some great rewards (scroll down for pics).\nWe\u2019ve accomplished a lot already, to make HAUNTERS a reality and we plan to premiere HAUNTERS in October 2015.\nOver the last year, we invested a tremendous amount of our own resources and money on pre-production, production and some post-production - on the good faith that there\u2019s an audience (*you*) who will share our passion for this movie.\nWe know it\u2019s risky to try to raise funding on Kickstarter, but we don\u2019t just see this as a way to help to cover the final costs to complete HAUNTERS. Making a documentary is crazy hard work and we are energized by others who share our passion!\nNot only do we have hundreds of hours of footage of amazing scares, behind-the-scenes drama and in-depth personal interviews with some of the most popular and infamous haunters in the world, we are ecstatic to have an all-star soundtrack already locked-down.\nSince soundscape is so important to the horror genre, we wanted HAUNTERS to deliver the caliber of cinematic audio experience we know fans will love:\nJonathan Snipes (Composer for ROOM 237) will compose an original score\nAlexander Burke (Magnolia Memoir & Save Ferris) is our Music Supervisor\nWe have rights to use 2 songs by DEAD MAN\u2019S BONES (written/performed by Ryan Gosling & Zach Shields)\nA documentary soundtrack normally costs ~$100K+, so we are incredibly lucky to have this dream team already committed to HAUNTERS The Movie.   \nEvery dollar raised above our initial goal will go to making HAUNTERS even better:  \n$30K STOP ANIMATION:  Many haunters shared heartwarming stories of how they got into haunting and we'd love to depict some of their origin stories in the most heartwarming way possible - stop animation!  We are lucky to have Pete Levin (Robot Chicken, etc) and Musa Brooker (Celebrity Death Match, etc) ready to jump on board. Pete says: \u201cHaunts are handmade and are created out of passion that first began at childhood. which is why I\u2019m excited to bring my stop animation skills to Haunters and bring a bit of whimsy, childhood innocence and my own handmade art to this incredibly visceral documentary.\"  \n$20K MOTION GRAPHICS: Many haunters' have wild dreams of the future of haunting and we want to use motion graphics to create their vision on screen, rather than just have them talk about it.  And, it would be great to have some killer titles of course...  We have several options for graphics, it will come down to what we can afford.\n$17K PROFESSIONAL COLORIST: All the different locations we wanted to include in HAUNTERS ended up generating a lot a variability in the video quality, so we'd ideally like to hire Juan Cabrera to take care of the coloring and make sure that HAUNTERS has a rich cinematic feel. Juan\u2019s credits include Transformers: Age of Extinction, Beneath, Amazing Spiderman, Prometheus, Star Trek Into Darkness, etc. \n$? CELEBRITY NARRATOR: We have a short list of celebs we\u2019d want to go after, if we could afford them. And, if we get to this level of fundraising on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll have a LOT more options for sure because they\u2019ll know they\u2019re part of something that already has an audience of dedicated fans. \nAll funds raised will be used to make HAUNTERS the best film it can be!    \nStop motion sequence by Pete Levin & Musa Brooker - so cool!\nSome of the people in HAUNTERS The Movie\nHAUNTERS THE MOVIE - PARTIAL CREDITS (L-to-R, top-to-bottom)\nJohn Murdy (Universal Halloween Horror Nights Hollywood, Creative Director) // Lora Ivanova (Co-Owner, ScareLA) // Melissa Carbone (Ten Thirty One Productions Great Horror Campout & LA Haunted Hayride, Co-Founder/Creator) // Russ McKamey (McKamey Manor Creator & Co-Owner) // Justin Meyer (Ten Thirty One Productions) // Jason Blum (Blumhouse Productions, Director/Producer The Purge & Paranormal Activity & etc ) // Josh Randall (BLACKOUT, Co-Creator & Co-Owner) // Brooke Walters (Knott's Scary Farm, Supervsor of Design) // Larry Bones (Bone Yard Effects) // Jill Killington (aka Jill Kill, Horror Writer/Reviewer/Expert) // Bruce Stanton (Reign of Terror) // Shar Mayer (Professional Monster & Entertainer) // Donald Julson (Nightmare on Loganberry, Creator) // Ted Dougherty (Haunt Historian) // Johanna Atilano (Theme Park Adventure, Co-Owner & ScareLA, Co-Producer) // Eric Lowther (Haunted Overload) // Jon Braver (DELUSION, Creator) // Iris Markofsky (aka Shard, Sinister Pointe) // Preston & Dianne Meyer (Rotten Apple 907) // Chris Atkins (aka Twitchy, Sinister Pointe) // Carol Schultz (McKamey Manor, Co-Owner) // Dasha Kittredge (DELUSION, Actress) // Slash (Haunt Fan & Musician) // Chris Williams (Universal HHN Hollywood, Art Director) // Patrick Tatopoulos (Special FX Master & Creature Creator) // McKensie Westmore (SyFy's Face Off) // Brady MacDonald (LA Times, Theme Park Reviewer) // Rick West (Theme Park Adventure, Co-Owner & ScareLA, Co-Producer) // Brian Kinsman (DIY Haunts, Creator/Owner) // Clay Stevens (Home Haunter) // Kristjan Thor (BLACKOUT, Co-Creator) // Melissa & Jason Thompson (Rotten Apple 907 & Co-Owners The Haunt Store)... and MORE!\nSince forming in 2008, www.TheBrainFactory.com has been involved in a variety of 3D projects.  \nHAUNTERS is a passion project, for everyone involved!\nTWO amazing artists created original images for the HAUNTERS Kickstarter fundraiser: \nHAUNT-HEAD by Dave Kloc - Dave is probably best-known for his Meltdown Comedy posters, which he produces for each Wednesday's show.

Aren't peanuts usually roasted? Why would you boil them?Peanuts had been eaten boiled for centuries, and it seems to have been a common way of preparing them in antebellum South Carolina when they were green and fresh out of the ground. W. H. Shelton, a Union soldier who was captured in 1864, escaped from a prison camp in Columbia. As he made his way eastward toward Charleston, he was given food by some of the African-American residents he encountered. In his account of his escape, he noted that he was provided on multiple occasions \"boiled peanuts, which was a favorite way of cooking when the bean was too green to bake.\"\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, peanuts became one of the country's most popular snack foods, but in the roasted, not boiled, form. In Northern cities, roasted peanuts were eaten in theaters, at circuses, on trains, and at baseball games. By World War I, peanuts had become a popular ingredient, too, being incorporated into salads, baked into cakes, and folded into an array of candies. But eating them boiled seems to have been confined to just a limited part of the Carolinas.\nAfter enjoying the pleasures of boiled peanuts in the South, for decades, we have moved North and realized they have not ever tried Boiled Peanuts, and never even heard of it!\nIt will be a unique plan, destined for success as nobody in the North knows, and/or sells Boiled Peanuts, we will be the only source for several hundred miles.

It is meant to be shared. A person receives a \"starter\" from a friend. A starter is a yeast fermenting sourdough culture. Person feeds and grows their starter, which is super easy, basically person stirs every day (that's it) and on day 5, feed the yeast. They get flour, milk, and sugar. After 10 days, person divides batter into four. One cup person keeps and bakes with, and the other three person passes along to friends, along with instructions. Super simple. Super delicious. And, there is a huge amount of different food that can be made from a starter. Like waffles, cakes, cookies, pizza dough, pretzels, rolls, biscuits, and cobblers just to name a few. And the starter, so long as fed properly, will stay around indefinitely. Pretty neat stuff. So I have put passion into starter feeding and my bread baking. Made with love. It is all too easy nowadays, to consume food that is \"filler\". It was convenient, cheap, whatever, but there was no love in it. I just want people to get back to eating at home, and enjoying it, and sharing that enjoyment with others.\nSo if this project is a success, I will be sending out a lot of starters, just in time for Christmas. What a great gift idea! The starter will be in dehydrated form and have complete instructions for reviving it (super easy), then feeding it, and last baking with it.

By sharing my work with you in the form of paper models and other rewards, I hope to build a much improved version of my real house and start a village of them. Together, we can dream a better world into being.\nWhy Live Tiny and Off-Grid?\nPeople are exploring the tiny life these days because it can drastically cut their clutter and expenses. They end up with more time and money for the people and activities they love. There\u2019s also something wonderful about having everything close at hand. But when people live small, the biggest winner is the web of life that sustains us.\nAccording to National Geographic, human activity is driving species extinct over a thousand times faster than normal. There hasn\u2019t been a mass extinction like this since the one that killed the dinosaurs. Sooner or later, the toll will include species, such as the honeybee, which millions of people depend on for survival. Adjusting a few thermostats won\u2019t help: the extinction rate will continue to increase until we make major cuts in our resource consumption and pollution.\nMy tiny house uses 30x less materials and energy than the average standalone house. Because it\u2019s so small, it\u2019s easy and relatively inexpensive to take it off-grid. All the electricity and water it uses comes from the sky. The toilet safely converts biohazardous waste into high-quality compost.\nI\u2019m developing two sites where clusters of tiny houses would share organic gardens, a diverse fleet of vehicles, and a common house with a commercial kitchen, laundry, lounge and work areas. In such a village, you could enjoy a vibrant community with an amazing standard of living at a tiny fraction of your current monthly expense.\nAbout the Paper Models\nThe models are approximately 1:60 scale, and exquisitely detailed inside and out. You can build each one in less than an hour without tape or glue.\nIn the Amaranth model, the exterior forms a ring, and the interior folds up and drops in from above, locking everything into place. Once built, it breaks into four flat pieces small enough to fit in a CD mailer. These can be re-assembled in two minutes.\nThe backrest for the couch doubles as a second bunk (I sailed 3,400 miles in a boat with flip-up bunks, so I know this works great). It also fits next to the couch to make a queen size bed. Of course this means the front door must open out like a storm door.\nThe roof locks in place with two tabs that tuck inside the inner walls. If you plan to take it apart much for flat storage and transport, it helps to reinforce the tabs of the exterior with a piece of tape.\nIn the model, the kitchen counter features drawings of a wood stove, sink, top-loading refrigerator, and a fold-up table.\nIn the real house, the area under the stove will store 70 gallons of rainwater in self-cleaning tanks with an automatic freeze-proofing system. The battery and inverter under the refrigerator will supply standard house current to the GFCI outlets over the counter and below the vanity mirror. The closed door opposite the wardrobe will open to a composting toilet. It's a 2-way door, creating a private dressing room with a wet bath.\nThe real Amaranth will measure 7x10 feet plus a 30-inch porch, with an inside area of 59 square feet (Peapod, my current house, is 8\u2019x14\u2019, excluding porch, with 98 square feet inside). Despite its smaller size, Amaranth features better storage than Peapod.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Amaranth models are designed, tested and ready for November delivery. I have limited hard copy production to what I can handle in that time frame. The models are simple, but challenging to put together. Card stock can tear and wrinkle with use; fortunately, you can always print out and build spares as needed.\n\nThe Peapod model exterior is ready to go, and I'm working on the interior.\n\nI have limited the number of custom design rewards to a workload that I can handle by the delivery date. The village design reward can start as early as February, weather permitting.\n\nAs a second-time builder, there\u2019s still a lot I don\u2019t know, so I am assembling a team of experienced builders who have agreed to consult with me on retainer throughout the project. Among them are Jeff Wilson, author of The Greened House Effect, my neighbor Jeremy Dixon, a builder with off-grid utility experience; Mamerto Tindongan, a renowned wood sculptor and traditional house builder; and Randall Gabriel, a local inventor with mad fabrication skills and a fast-growing solar business.\n\nI am also working to create an owner-builder co-op for tiny houses, so additional labor may be available at critical times during the project. My goal is to develop a local off-grid talent pool versed in a well-defined set of best practices.\n\nI should be able to finish the real Amaranth well before June 1. My current house took 12 weeks to build under the direction of Danny Yahini, another experienced builder. Amaranth uses fewer materials, and this time I know where to get every component, and what the lead times are. I\u2019m creating an indoor space to build all the components in winter, and I\u2019ll order the long lead-time parts as soon the project is funded.

Like a deckmop it can focus the power of the scrubbing action into a small area. With the oak dowel I can really scrub hard to clean gunk on the tile, but the spring designed into the steel will keep it from scrubbing too hard and damaging a surface like hardwood. \n       THE GREENEST WAY TO CLEAN\nLess disposables saves money and the environment.\n                       BUILT FOR LIFE\nQUICK-LOOP with a standard U.S. mop handle\nSteel and unfinished American oak. No moving parts to wear, no replacement sponges or sheets to buy. The loop traps the cloth and holds it. \nEarly adopters will get hand assembled units made by me. \nHand milled oak\nSome background:\nThe awesome thing about emerging technologies is that sometimes they can be used to make something really simple. QUICK-LOOP is possible due to advances in 3D computer controlled wire forming. Inspired by an old Latin American mop design called the Cuban Mop, the combination of a high tech formed steel spring and the low tech red oak dowel create something totally unique. This cleaner works better, easier, faster, and more economically. It saves money and reduces waste. \nThis can work with whatever type of cleaning solution you like. Enough of us are trying to wrap our flat mops in real cloth to save from buying the disposables that companies are making spray or squirt bottles of cleaner. This is a fantastic combination with the QUICK-LOOP. Method, Bona, Murphy's Oil Soap, and many others have spray or squirt wood floor cleaners now.\nNext steps:\nPlease support the project. If you have a sturdy mop handle with a standard American thread (almost all US. mop handles are the same), then choose a Head Only support level. If you'd like us to send you a handle, then choose the full kit level. Both levels are around the price of a couple of disposable refill packs for flat mops.

The technology for forming wire shapes is amazing, and well established. Springs are easily formed in fantastic shapes with incredible speed. I have contracts with several manufacturers for the spring. \n\nThe tricky part is the low tech oak dowel. Oak is not a uniform material. It does not like to be drilled. The drill bit tends to follow the grain and drift. For mass production this project will require a machine that work with the constraints of the natural material. There are several good machine companies that can tackle the issues. Right now the manual process works fine, but it's slow. Depending on how well this project is supported I'll be able to either greatly improve the manual process or fully automate the drilling and slotting of the red oak.

I want this in peoples hands. I want people that want it to have it, and to tell others about it because it's too awesome to keep to themselves.

Not only is it a thing of the future, that future is here today! Unfortunately it did kind of sneak up on us, so we at Heroes and Games are going to make sure that you have access to it whenever you need it, and we\u2019ll make sure that it\u2019s affordable for our customers in this weakened economy.\nWhat we want to do here is cater to as many customers as possible. And the best way to possibly do that, is to have two printers. That\u2019s right, two!!! One ceramic and one plastic. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve come up with a list of everyone that would benefit from our store being their one-stop-shop for all things related to their needs in the 3D printing realm. Just imagine how many different types of interests and needs we can cater to with this technology!\nOne type of customer is the cosplayer. With your help we\u2019ll be able to offer affordable 3D printing for cosplayer\u2019s who want 3D renderings of themselves in costume. They work extremely hard getting those costumes together for every show, and we\u2019ve decided to make it our responsibility to give them the means to solidify (literally) that experience and take it home with them. If you take a look at how detailed these printouts would be, they\u2019ll be a must have for anyone looking for a keepsake from every con. Another type of customer is the table-top gamer. D&D and Warhammer players for example, would be able to create their own terrain or game pieces. How cool would it be to give your characters or avatars a detailed and realistic world to embark on in their adventures?\nBut those aren\u2019t the only types of customers that we want to help, I\u2019m sure that everyone can think of at least one use for a 3D printer that would apply to them! How about cheerleaders? Athletes? Military Service members? Statues and keepsakes are sought after by a huge portion of collectors, they don\u2019t just have to be related to pop culture.\nBut let me turn this over to the guys who\u2019ll be making all of your dreams come true! \nNow don\u2019t let me limit your imagination when it comes to what you can create. By having these printers in our store, you\u2019ll be able to create to your imagination\u2019s extent. If there is such a thing. Here\u2019s the catch though, we\u2019re going to need your help to get these things in here. And once they\u2019re in our store, it\u2019ll be for good. And we\u2019ll only have you to thank for it. The best part of getting all of your help, is that the more money we receive, the bigger the ceramic printer we\u2019ll be able to get! And doesn\u2019t bigger always mean better? Of course it does! So any donation that you\u2019ll be able to give will be greatly appreciated.\nThe staff and patrons of Heroes and Games thank you for your consideration.

It\u2019s just a matter of course that in every fantasy rpg you play your first level adventurers will go out and murder a couple dozen kobolds, collect their loot, a bit of experience and move on to bigger badder things. Ever wonder what the kobolds thought about all this? Ever think maybe all those kobolds aren\u2019t the bad guys we make them out to be? Well No Country For Old Kobolds is built to explore the world through their eyes!\nSometimes this view of the world can be comedic, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes heroic.\nNo Country For Old Kobolds is a tabletop pen and paper rpg based on Dungeon World by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel and World of Dungeons by John Harper. While it maintains some of the core mechanics of these two games it has been heavily modified to better model the world of kobolds. \nYou'll play champion kobolds - the best of the best - protecting your village from the kingdoms that you created during game setup. As your kobolds die they pass traits down to their children, each generation getting stronger and more capable! You'll fight for your village in a game of survival, heroism and black comedy.\nNo Country For Old Kobolds is built for up to 6 players including the game master (the storyteller and referee). By funding this game you'll get the full color core rulebook, all digital stretch goals, and access to all beta documentation so you can start playing today! What are you waiting for? Go pledge!\nBy Jorge F. Mu\u00f1oz\nShared Characters - All players share the village character. It\u2019s the central character and the only one to advance via XP! \nGenerational Play - You'll play multiple generations of kobolds, in No Country For Old Kobolds your player characters actually advance by dying and passing on traits to their young! \nPlayer Created Worlds - Each player will create the kingdoms that surround the village, they'll also come up with the reasons why those kingdoms hate your village! \nMission & Story Driven Play - Gameplay is both mission - fulfilling village needs, and story - working to undermine the surrounding kingdoms and create better positioning for your village! \nDeath Mechanics - Even after death you'll be able to contribute to combat and help your fellow Kobolds complete their missions! \nMulti-Level Play - No Country For Old Kobolds features multiple levels of play to model just how small and weak kobolds actually are. The three levels of play are kobold, unit and village. Each of these have slightly different rules, moves and mechanics! \nby Jorge F. Mu\u00f1oz\nWhether you\u2019re familiar with Dungeon World or not you shouldn't have any issue grasping the rules for No Country For Old Kobolds. I've specifically designed it to be new player friendly while still providing enough meat for experienced players.\nAs you create new kobold generations you\u2019ll get to tinker with what abilities and skills to take as well as create new strategies and combinations for their use. As your village grows in numbers and experience you\u2019ll get to choose new moves that will affect all player kobolds, add new recruitable units and generally grow as a group. \nAs a GM you\u2019ll find the mission driven gameplay, unit level combat and player generated world do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. These features allow you to focus on creating a rich fiction for the players to delve into and live the lives of kobolds constantly harried by the surrounding kingdoms and all their first level adventurers! \nHere's an play through with the Indie+ folks!\nby Jorge F.

Throw your money at Steve Wallace now!\" - Travis Scott, playtester and creator of DragonKnights!\n\"No Country for Old Kobolds flips the table on the players. Instead of playing hyper competent adventurers tasked with cleansing the world of evil, the players are handed the weak and misunderstood kobold. Through wits and ingenuity \u2013 though some may say cowardice \u2013 the characters must survive a world bent on their destruction, or at least better prepare their village and progeny for what lies ahead.\" - Jeremey Friesen, Origins playtester\n\"In No Country For Old Kobolds, the sad short life of a kobold is brought into focus with joyful black humor as their everyday problems incite an epic struggle that the players themselves helped to design. While at first you are left thinking the goal might be to achieve the most glorious death possible, for me it really is more about personal sacrifice so that your community, your family, can continue to exist.

To avoid that I've completed multiple drafts of the core rules already and have heavily play tested them.\n\nBeing an artist myself I know that delays with art can seriously hinder deadlines. To mitigate issues with such delays I'm working with artists who I know personally and have proven to me they can be trusted to deliver on time. On top of that I have other artists who can pick up the slack if something dire happens.\n\n \nBecause printing delays and quality can often be an issue with books I've decided to work with a printer whose product I already own and who comes highly recommended by others in the industry. On top of that they're within driving distance of me so that I can not only provide on site feedback for quality control but I can also pick up the books instead of having them shipped which should alleviate the chance of damage in bulk processing. \n\nShipping this quantity of materials can always be a challenge, having been in the self publishing industry for 15 years I've had to deal with shipping all kinds of art, books and comics and know the time and commitment I'm making here.

Bingle, Dylan Birtolo, Tracy Chowdhury, Maxwell Alexander Drake, Stephanie Drummonds, Ed Greenwood, Sarah Hans, Gabrielle Harbowy, Rosemary Jones, C.S. Marks, Muffy Morrigan, Daniel Myers, Brian Pettera, Aaron Rosenberg, and Kelly Swails.\nFor this anthology we have chosen to follow the model pioneered by Silence in the Library Publishing.  The funding goal for this project was set at a level necessary to produce the anthology and pay the authors a competitive rate for their work, Should the project go above and beyond, the authors will share equally with the publisher in any profit from the sale of books.\nThe Recipes\nEver wonder what a real bard would eat?  Each of the stories in the anthology will be accompanied by a real recipe from a fictional tavern, The Black Dragon Inn.  The recipes have been carefully adapted from a variety of sources, including medieval European cooking manuscripts, to reflect the unique cuisine of a fantasy world while still appealing to the modern palate.\nThe Black Dragon Inn is one of those strange little places that exists on the edge of town that somehow seems to be the center of action while still being a quiet refuge. There is a fire in the open hearth that lights the wood of the tables and bar with its warm, flickering glow. The air is filled with smells of wood smoke, and ale, and roasting meat. The barkeep looks up from filling pints for other patrons and nods to you. \"Take a seat,\" she says, \"and I'll get you something to eat.\"\nIllustrations\nEach of the stories in this anthology will be illustrated by David Szilagyi. Here is David's illustration for \"The Haunting of the Lordly Lion\" by Ed Greenwood.\nAdd-ons\n$15 - A signed 8x10 print of an illustration of your choice from the anthology (if you're an international backer, please add $3 for shipping)  \n$20 - A signed 11x14 print of an illustration of your choice from the anthology. (if you're an international backer, please add $3 for shipping) \n$15 - An extra trade paperback copy of The Bard's Tale (If you've backed at an electronic reward-only level, please add $5 for shipping. If you're an international backer and have backed at a print reward level, please add $5 for shipping. If you're an international backer and have backed at an electronic reward only level, please add $20 for shipping)\nStretch Goals\nThe Bard's Tale is all about telling stories, so the stretch goals are centered around getting more stories into the hands of the readers.\nThe First 100 Backers - ACHIEVED - Will get a free digital download of the first novel in Maxwell Alexander Drake's Genesis of Oblivion Saga, Farmers and Mercenaries.\nThe First 200 Backers - ACHIEVED - Will get a free digital download of Donald J. Bingle's anthology Not-So-Heroic Fantasy. This anthology includes Donald's story \"The Eye-Candy of Argon\", a critical and satirical re-telling (from a different perspective) of \"The Eye Of Argon\"--widely regarded as the worst published fantasy story of all time.\n$6,250 - ACHIEVED - All backers at or above $5 will get a free digital download of Brian Pettera's novella \"The Golden Path\" from Bards and Sages Publishing.\n$6,500 - ACHIEVED - All backers at or above $5 will get a free digital download of Muffy Morrigan's novels The Sail Weaver and The Hunt.\n$7,000 - ACHIEVED - We'll add an original story to the anthology by Forgotten Realms author Richard Lee Byers.\n$7,500 - All backers at or above $5 will get a free digital download of C.

The remaining artwork and additional stories for stretch goals add some complexity, but nothing that should delay publication.\n\nAside from the content of the book, the biggest challenges for a publisher are printing and order fulfillment. We are working with the same printers and shippers that Silence in the Library have used for their projects, and expect the same excellent quality of service.

We've met and served over 8,000 people so far and are excited to grow HCT into additional neighborhoods, businesses, AND days of the week. We believe the most efficient way to do this is with a mobile kitchen \u2013 allowing us to take the HCT experience anywhere our customers lead us.\n\nBack Story.\nIn November last year, my wife and I took an adventure to Nashville, Tennessee. Among many things in that town, we instantly fell in love with the tradition and community around hot chicken. The wheels started spinning immediately.\nWhen we returned, we started testing recipes and hosting hot chicken parties at our house. The chicken kept getting better and the group kept getting larger. And somehow \u2013 alongside having a new baby \u2013 we went from parties to concept dinners to pre-sale events at the Columbus Food Hub in April.\n\nMission.\nBeyond great food, we're passionate about bringing together an eclectic and diverse community of customers. Our guests have come from every pocket of Central Ohio (and beyond) and are met with hospitality, not just from our team, but from one another. We're very excited to extend this HCT community even further. A mobile kitchen will make this happen.\nAdditionally, our business exists to support a unique employment mission. We rely on strong partners like Community Properties of Ohio and The Columbus Urban League to refer job candidates who are highly motivated to work but have barriers to successful employment - often ranging from less-than-marketable work histories to run-ins with the criminal justice system. Once hired, employees receive significant support, coaching, and investment to support them as they move forward. \nThe addition of mobile selling should over double our current volume. This means up to a dozen new job opportunities at HCT - a big increase in sustainable impact through employment. These jobs would be in addition to the jobs already provided in our Olde Towne East location.\nAnd lastly, we make sure no food goes to waste. All inventory that remains at the end of our day heads to Faith Mission shelters.\nHalf of the team!\n\nTrailer Design.\nAfter many, many conversations with industry leaders and mentors, we've opted for a trailer versus a food truck for our mobile kitchen. A trailer provides more versatility in design but also eliminates the risk of a failed engine or vehicle mechanicals (i.e. if our truck breaks down, we can always borrow or rent another tow vehicle). We're currently finalizing plans for construction and anticipate a 10-12 week period for completion.\n\nThe trailer has been designed to accommodate 4-6 kitchen staff stations and has sufficient capacity to serve 600 people in a 4hr time frame. The estimated budget, with equipment, is 50-70k.\nThe first draft - drawn two months ago!\n\nHave Trailer. Will Travel.\nOnce complete, we'll immediately use the trailer for unique selling opportunities this winter (we're very close to talking publicly about these!). Beyond that point, we intend on taking our restaurant on the road throughout both Franklin and Delaware counties. HCT will seek opportunities to serve new neighborhoods by setting up shop for 2-4 weeks, expanding the same set-up and dining experience customers have had in Olde Towne East.\nThe trailer also provides the opportunity to serve special events and businesses. We've dabbled in this space on several occasions but have an inadequate set-up to do it profitably and reliably. We've begun discussions with several large corporate campuses - though they may change their minds when they learn about #HotChickenNaps (we'll file that under 'Risks and Challenges').\n\nFunding Goals.\nThis Kickstarter is our first push for the big investment anticipated going forward. On top of the trailer, we hope to invest in an additional restaurant set-up (tables, benches, tents, etc), reliable tow vehicle, and upgraded kitchen equipment. The funding goal of 40k is the minimum goal needed for us to move forward but the additional goals bring our anticipated investment closer to 80k.\n\nGold-on-Black.\nWe worked hard to imagine worthy rewards for your contributions.

These will definitely be growth opportunities for our leadership team and staff. And if our assumptions and plans have gaps, we could definitely incur delays in execution.\n\nAn additional risk is that we've underestimated the costs of this plan.

It may need some graphic design work, but the functionality has been successfully tried and tested.

As one can see from the picture above, we've already gone ahead and produced the first batch of fobs. Also, as already highlighted, we've already successfully developed the functionality of the website and the overall callback system.\nMiracleFone: A Brief Historical Recap\nBy the end of 2012 we were ready to start selling our first batch of fully functional fobs. While we were beta testing our first batch and preparing an updated marketing strategy, we discovered that certain cell phone manufacturers had recently tweaked their products' Bluetooth functionalities often resulting in their brand's Bluetooth accessories (e.g. headsets) becoming the only compatible options. Unfortunately, the MiracleFone team didn't plan on this change and it resulted in our fobs becoming incompatible with many major cell phones (not including the Apple iPhone which still currently works just fine with the fobs).\nMiracleFone: Onward!\nYour Kickstarter funds will go directly to retooling the mechanisms found inside the fobs and the overall call back processes. These updates will further ensure that if future Bluetooth changes are implemented by cell phone manufacturers, the capability of our fobs to successfully generate a callback will not be affected. \nWe have the knowledge, experience, motivation, and the contacts needed to retool and get a finished product out to the market, but the entire process will require additional funding. We are seeking your Kickstarter contributions to help fund the next steps.\nRewards\n**Please note that we have hundreds of finished fobs ready for use for iPhone users. Due to Bluetooth changes certain cell phone manufacturers made to their products, non-iPhone users will have to wait for the second generation of fobs to be manufactured (with help from the Kickstarter funding) before we can mail their reward fobs highlighted below.**\nTeam Bio\nHi, my name is Mike Miracle and a few years ago I was confronted with a common problem people have when dealing with other people; it seems that I consider my time more valuable than other people do.  The situation was this; I was in my office, doing my work when a co-worker came in.  He didn\u2019t seem to have anything better to do than to come in and talk to me about local sports.  Normally, I give someone about two minutes of chit-chat kinda back and forth before I move on. Being trapped in my office, I had nowhere to move on to.  So I thought, wouldn't it be great to have a button you could press that would make your phone ring?  Something small, simple and easily hidden so no one would see you use it.  I could press the button, my phone would ring a few seconds later, I would answer, respond to the voice at the other end by saying, \u201cCan you hold on a second, I have someone in my office\u201d and tell the intruder to \u201cPlease excuse me, I have to take this call\u201d.  How awesome would that be?\n\nSoon after, I got a couple of my friends behind the project and we got rolling with designing, prototyping, and testing the fob and the website. Below is one of our original sketches. \nTeam Skill Background\n\nMike Miracle (me) -I have been a business application software developer for nearly 40 years, including insurance, mining and educational software application domains.  For about 20 years I have been a software consultant and my wife and I have owned and operated another local business for the past 20 years.  I have always enjoyed the challenges associated with solving difficult technical problems, which is why this project appealed so much to me.  Although it might seem that giving the product my family name is an act of vanity, the truth is, it just sounded catchy.  Hope you don\u2019t mind.\n\nI have trusted contacts in the manufacturing, legal, financial, and web/smartphone app development industries within my network that I have already utilized or plan on tapping into to contribute to the success of MiracleFone.\nSeth Stern- Seth is truly the technical wizard behind the scenes of MiracleFone.

Oddmall is the winner of the Akron / Canton Hotlist Award for Best Arts & Crafts, in case that sort of knowledge is of interest.\nWell, see, that's the thing. We moved from a relatively small and inexpensive venue to a very large and extremely pricey location. This has allowed us to make Oddmall the show we always wanted it be, with all the incredible crafts, art, games, cosplay, tattoos, live entertainment, and assorted awesomeness we can imagine. It was a BIG move and vital to the continuance of Oddmall.\nWe are absolutely committed to keeping Oddmall FREE. We will NEVER charge admission for Oddmall. We set out to make Oddmall the sort of show we would want to attend, and we don't want to pay to attend it, so you don't have to either. Comparable events charge upwards of $50-80 a day, but that's just not how Oddmall rolls.\nObviously, there are significant costs involved in running a show like Oddmall. Without disclosing the actual amounts, believe me when I tell you the venue costs, labor charges, advertising fees, and supply expenditures add up to A LOT. Of course, the vendors do pay for their spaces, but I'm not comfortable increasing their fees any higher than they are now, which are as low as I can make them and still make it worth our time to host the show. So, we won't charge admission and we won't pass the costs on to the vendors. What are we to do? What indeed...\nOh, I know! We could hold a Kickstarter campaign and offer people a bunch of great rewards and sponsorship opportunities to help defray some of the expense. Yeah, that's what we'll do. In fact, it's what we're doing right now.\nFirst off, the funds raised through this Kickstarter will help us pay the monumental costs associated with holding an event of this size and offering free admission. Once the venue is paid off, a substantial amount will be spent on advertising, increasing public awareness and bringing more people to the show. We'll also use a chunk of the proceeds to stock the Oddmall gift shop with T-shirts, stickers, stuffed monsters, and all those other things in the Rewards section, as well as producing those things and shipping them to the Kickstarter backers.\nAdditionally, we have set a few Stretch Goals that might be of interest:\nStretch Goal #1 ($500): Expanded Trick or Treating\nTrick or treating will be happening all day Saturday at Oddmall. If we reach this first modest stretch goal trick or treaters who visit the Oddmall Gift Shop will receive an Oddmall button or sticker along with their sweet, sweet candy or lame box of raisins (while supplies last). ATTAINED!\nStretch Goal #2 ($1000): Super Awesome Oddmall Halloween Party  \nThis will be an Oddmall Halloween costume party on Friday night (October 31) at The Empire (a brand new club in Akron). All Oddmall vendors and their guests will be receive a free invitation! There will be live music, a costume contest, and all sorts of other super nifty jazz.\nStretch Goal #3 ($2000): Expanded Kid Cave\nThe Oddmall Kid Cave (sponsored by The Goddard School) is a great place for kids to hang out while their parents take time to shop and enjoy the various whatnots of Oddmall. Certified preschool teachers are on hand to entertain the kids with crafts, games, and other exciting jazz. If we raise $2000 or more, we'll expand the Kid Cave into a larger room (rather than the landing it currently occupies), which will allow the kids more space for their activities and assorted rambunciousnesses.\nStretch Goal #4 ($4000): Anime Theater\nIf we reach $4000 we'll set up a movie theater room showing anime and cult films during show hours. It'll be super fun and, as always, admission will be totally free.\nStretch Goal #5 ($6000): Oddmall Coloring Book\nWe'll make a sweet Oddmall coloring book, featuring art by world famous international superstar illustrator / super model Andy Hopp (that's me, hi). It will be given FOR FREE to the all the kids who come to Oddmall (while supplies last).\nStretch Goal #6 ($6,034): Potato Salad\nApparently potato salad is a thing people on the internet are into nowadays. Who knew... If we reach this goal there will be some Official Homemade Oddmall Potato Salad at the Saturday night party.\nStretch Goal #7 ($7,000): It's a secret...\nI'll reveal this stretch goal and others as they approach.\nOf course, we aren't just looking for free handouts. In addition to the whole FREE art fair, craft show, live entertainment, and pop culture con thing we have plenty of sweet rewards for our backers (including a chance to be a permanent part of the brand new Oddmall Trailer!). \nBackers may either pick up their rewards at Oddmall (in the Oddmall Gift Shop) or have them mailed directly (domestic shipping is included at no extra charge).\nYou can nab any of these by selecting the appropriate reward listed on the right hand side of this page, or by adding the listed amount to any other pledge.

It's going to be covered in sweet, colorful graphics espousing our various endeavors. Certain portions of the trailer will be reserved for graphics showing off our amazing friends and sponsors (that's you). Starting at only $20 you can have your name, logo, or image affixed, in full color, as a permanent part of the trailer for all to see. The amount of space you get to cover is based on how much you pledge, as follows:\n$20: 4\"x4\"\n$35: 4\"x8\"\n$50: 4\"x12\"\n$75: 8\"x12\"\n$100: 12\"x12\"$150: 8\"x24\"\n$200: 12\"x24\"\nYou provide the artwork and we'll make the decals. If you'd rather have us do the art we can work that out too.\nProgram Book Ads\nOddmall's full color program book is handed out free to all guests (while supplies last). It includes maps, entertainment schedules, vendor lists, artwork, and other important information and snazzy jazz. It's also a great place to plop your ads and coupons. Just add the listed amount to any pledge to get yourself the ad or coupon you desire (you supply the art).\n$25: Business card sized ad or coupon (2\u2033x3\u2033)\n$50: Quarter page ad or coupon (2.75\u2033x4.25\u2033)\n$100: Half page ad or coupon (5.5\u2033x4.25\u2033)\n$200: Full page ad or coupon (5.5\u2033x8.5\u2033)\nVendor Booths (+$80 and up)\nOddmall offers three different vendor booth sizes (8'x3', 6'x8', and 10'x10'). You can nab one through this kickstarter, which is what I'd recommend if you also want to get your hands on any of our other rewards, or you can reserve one directly on the Oddmall website. Vendors get to choose their own booth based on the map and list found here. That means the sooner you sign up the more chance you'll have of getting the specific booth you want. If we run out of booths on that map we'll get more rooms from the convention center, so don't worry if it's getting full.\nYou may bring your own tables or rent one from the convention center by adding $10 to your pledge. If you want electricity please add $60 to your pledge (this charge is from the convention center, not us).\nNote: The Oddmall Art Fair is reserved for vendors who are selling handmade items (including original art, art reproductions, jewelry, toys, plushies, costumes, etc...) created by the seller or a representative thereof. The Geek Expo is open to anyone selling anything cool (toys, games, books, costumes, art, just about anything...).\nSpecial Instructions for Kickstarter Backers\nIf you nab your booth through the kickstarter please fill out the registration form as soon as you make your pledge so we can get you the booth you want. Just put KICKSTARTER BACKER in the section that says \"Notes or Special Instructions\". Click SUBMIT but then close the window when PayPal opens (please don't cancel your pledge after you reserve your booth, that would really mess us up).\nClick to Enlarge\nA Small Sample of Oddmall Vendors and also some Mandalorians\nSponsorships\nPlease visit the Oddmall website to learn more about our many sponsorship opportunities.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOddmall: Emporium of the Weird (ohio edition) will happen whether or not this campaign is successful.

Different plants in different parts of our area allow our honeybees to make a very unique and area specific type of honey. In order to capture the different varieties, we are expanding to another location in Akron.  Thus, by harvesting a few times throughout the year, we can showcase the different flavors of the neighborhoods.\nCrestland Park Apiary\nWhere have and will you keep your bees?\nOver the last year and a half we bought some vacant land right here in the city, built a fence, and began raising bees. Our bees will be kept on additional vacant land, and hosted by some of Akron's residents and organizations.  Our eyes are on Akron's North Hill area for our second apiary site situated on vacant land.\nVariety and Organic\nFeatured at the Eye Opener\nWhy Urban Honey over traditional honey?\nAlthough we initially planned on keeping the honey for ourselves, upon our first harvest last year everything changed after tasting the dark, rich, full taste of our fall urban honey. The rest is history and we are doing the same thing again next year. Urban Honey is extremely unique, and since the bees are foraging in Akron's neighborhoods, each batch of honey holds the identity of that neighborhood. Additionally, honeybees do very well in our area because of the variety in their food sources. The flowers they feast on are all over the place, and vary in kind.  And with our Urban Honey, the consumer will know in exactly what area the honey was made, and the exact date the honey was harvested.  We label all of that information.\nSo how will the funds be used?\nEvery penny will be used in the most frugal manner. In order to grow from 7 to somewhere around 25 hives, we need boxes for the bees, the bees themselves, the land, honey storage, and bottling supplies. The recipe is simple, yet it takes a lot of work, funding and dedication to see this through. I've done it all by myself once, and I'm ready to light this town up and do it again.\nYou mentioned needing 10 more hives in the video, but also mention growing to around 25?\nGrowing responsibly is not something to be taken lightly. This is a sensitive craft, since this is agriculture based. 10 hives is a safe number I'm willing to place at any location to test the waters. Factors that could harm the bees include available food sources, miscellaneous pesticide spraying, and any diseases in the area. After I see it is safe for them, we will increase the size of the colonies on site. If you are going to undertake a duty such as this, you must do it right, not fast.\nREWARD PARTNERS\nThe Lockview-  http://www.thelockview.com/\nChurned Ice Cream Shop-  http://www.churnedicecream.com/\nMEDIA\nCrestland Park Apiary- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5NjQCkgyxU\nAkron Honey Company- http://akronist.com/akron-honey-company-draft/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many risks that are unique to beekeeping. We all will be at the mercy of mother nature. You can only prepare your bees so they have the best chance at thriving and thus, honey production. \nTiming is key so that the hive has as many bees as possible during the nectar flow (peak bee food season). The more bees available for food gathering, the more food there will be. I have and will continue to subject myself to research based on maximizing my honey crop. \nThere in a chance that 2015 season conditions will delay honey based reward fulfillment to late 2015/early 2016.\nManaging Pests: I have not treated for mites using chemicals.

By the fall, we took over the garlic operations and began thinking of ways to spice things up. Out of a love and passion for cooking, we created a variety of garlic products for home cooks to enjoy.\n    Using only organic practices, our garlic is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals and all of our products are made without any artificial preservatives or additives. Our products are made with 100% pure garlic cloves that have been hand peeled to ensure that no roots, stems nor skins dilute our flavors and to ensure the quality of each clove.\n     Even though we no longer grow all of the garlic that is used in our products, we promise to continue using only ecologically grown Ohio garlic that meets our quality standards to keep customers and Mother Earth happy!\nMinced Market Product Line\nMinced Garlic\nOur crushed garlic contains 100% Ohio grown\ngarlic cloves free from stalks, skins and roots.\nSimply scoop this garlic out and toss it in any\ndish you create in your kitchen.

The cloves have a fig-like\nconsistency that can be sliced thinly for cooking\nor simply eaten whole. Containing more\nconcentrated antioxidants and nutrients than\nraw garlic, black garlic is healthier with very\nunique flavors. Black garlic pairs well with\nbreads, meats, cheeses and malty beers due to\nthe similar chemistry between all of these artisan\ntreats.\nBlack Garlic Puree\nBlack garlic is fermented garlic that has a complex\nflavor comprised of sweet, savory and mild garlic.\nContaining more concentrated antioxidants and\nnutrients than raw garlic, black garlic is healthier\nand tastier in its own unique way. Use this\ncrushed black garlic as a spread on crackers with\nyour favorite cheese and charcuterie, or spread\nthinly on a fresh salmon filet before baking. The\nnatural sugars from the garlic will surprise your\ntaste buds in many different dessert as well.\nSmokey Garlic & Herb Butter\n\nGarlic bread, roasted veggies, potato topper,\npan seared salmon\u2026 How will you use our\ndelicious Smoked Garlic and Herb Butter in\nyour kitchen?

Seeing that (real) men don\u2019t carry purses or have fanny-packs, there\u2019s little room to carry an awkward, bulky or long comb. That\u2019s why I created the HandleBeard; a small, rugged, durable device that will clip onto a keychain, belt loop, etc. Don\u2019t go around town known as the dude with the jacked up frizz-face. Get your beard in order, no matter where your next adventure takes you.\nThe HandleBeard\nThe MEGA HB\nAs promised, those with the thickest and longest of beards can opt for the MEGA HB. The teeth are double in length, and the overall width is just under an inch longer. The teeth are also a hair (no pun intended) wider to increase the durability of each tooth. The MEGA HB has the same tooth spacing which will minimizes the hangups in those thick beards. This model is obviously not as portable as the original, but still more portable compared to other options out there! Here is a 3d model of what the MEGA HB will look like.\nMEGA HB\nComparison\nThe Construction\nThe HandleBeard is CNC machined (water jet cut) from a solid piece of 1/8 inch thick aluminum. It's then sandblasted and anodized in black to make a smooth finish. In order to make it easy to carry (whether on your keys or in your pocket) the total length of the HandleBeard is only 3.5 inches. This gives more than enough room to groom, but allows it to be very portable, light, and strong.\nAfter making numerous prototypes, I made the teeth of the comb spaced out a bit wider than many other beard combs on the market. I found this much more pleasant than the narrow spaced teeth and won't get caught up in thicker beards. The carabiner is solid stainless steel, so there's no way this thing is getting loose and lost.\nThe Design\nMy goal was to create something unique and appealing, but that also had the durability and functionality for rougher bearded men, all at an affordable price. This is the reason I decided to make the HandleBeard one solid piece, teeth and all. As a Stretch Goal, I would love to create a premium version in titanium as well as offer multiple colors. I would also like to offer custom engraving down the road to really personalized it.\nWhat Will I Do with the Investment?\nMaking the HandleBeard in low volumes is simply not an option due to the high machining cost. This round of money will get me enough people so that I am able to fund a first inventory run, which will lower the cost down to an affordable level. To give you an idea, 1 prototype cut and finished was quite costly, but obviously the cost falls substantially when a larger order is made.\nI already have a machining company ready and lined up, which has impressed me with both the quality and the cost per unit. Now it's all about seeing if the interest is there to fuel a minimum order quantity as well as expand the material options and colors.\nStretch Goals?\nI would love to be able to produce these in multiple colors. As of now they will only be made in black, but if enough people back the project, I may be able to offer a few color options. After a social media polling, green, gold, and metallic or gun metal may be the next options.\nMy second stretch goal would be to get a premium model made out of titanium. This metal is obviously much more expensive, but very light and strong.\nLast stretch goal would be to offer custom engraving on the front. Examples would be initials, company logos, charities, etc. This would really personalize each HandleBeard and be great options for gifts, groomsmen gifts, company swag, etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of now, I do not foresee any major risks or areas of concern. The only issue I have had with the final prototype was that the carabiner was not springing back into place as well as I would have liked, but I have already talked with the engineer and a simple adjustment was made to the spacing of the holes that holds the carabiner in place, so this has been taken care of!

Our goal is to make lessons simple enough that even children (and interested adults) can keep up with the ideas and get excited about Computer Science! PtF will be constructed as an online, interactive textbook that uses mini-games to teach important coding concepts. We want to approach programming more as a foreign language rather than an abstract math problem. While learning a language, one learns not only vocabulary and grammar but also cultural stories, relational values and ways of thinking. Every language opens a new and exciting cultural door; programming needs to be perceived the same way. Instead of painting a monotonous picture of hunting down a missing semi-colon for three hours, we will show what programming really is: it is fluid problem solving; it is research; it is trial and error. It is a giant puzzle that requires persistence and creativity--skills valuable to people who will never even touch a programming interface.\nWhy is this important?\nAs science and technology grow, there is an increasing demand for computer scientists, but  there is also a decreasing interest amongst students in the STEM fields. Although this is the first generation of children to have had easy access to technology for their entire lives, enrollment rates in STEM fields are still dropping. By the time these students reach college many of them have typically already formed their opinion of STEM fields--with most deciding it isn't for them. To make matters worse, as many as 40% of science majors change their mind while in college because they were underprepared for their classes, with as many as 30-60% of college freshman failing their first programming course. This is because Computer Science is often taught as a highly technical, confusing subject and the \"you're either a programmer or you're not\" mentality runs rampant. Instead, with a little ingenuity and creativity, Computer Science can be taught so that it reaches people of all different thinking styles.\nHow will it work?\nProgramming the Future is different because we are aiming to teach programming--without any mandatory programming. This is an approach called 'visual coding' in which Computer Science fundamentals are taught in theory, separate from a programming language. It works on the premise of being able to quickly pick up any language once you understand the core principles involved. This is great for business professionals who may never do any coding but need to understand database schemas or for children trying to develop analytical thinking skills. This concept is currently being investigated with children in math, presenting math as being about patterns and structures rather than tiny numbers to manipulate. Dr. Droujkova started teaching small children algebra and calculus, having children do things like create fractals, which allows children to explore recursion and infinitesimals. In keeping with her ideas, Programming the Future will use a series of mini-games and videos to convey important coding concepts. If learning is to be as efficient as possible, it's essential that children want to learn. Teaching through games opens up the concept of 'free play;' students can control how long they play and what they learn, preserving the excitement of learning.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe most difficult part of any learning software is making sure that it is effective for the target audience.

We just need your help to put it in motion!\nThe new collection makes our head spin!\nWHAT\u2019S NEW\nThere are 7 all new skulls, including our first dinosaur, the awesome Velociraptor.\nAnd, a fearsome Dire Wolf (Yes, it was a real animal)!\nNymeria?\nWe developed a new modeling technique that improves on everything we learned during our first campaign to give the Dire Wolf a beautifully articulated jaw.\nIn addition to seven new specimens, one of our most popular skulls from our first campaign is now our first fashion accessory: the Gray Wolf cufflinks.\nWe\u2019ve continued to hone our craft at every level and these new skulls are our best yet. With higher resolution 3D scans, a better 3D printer, and an improved polishing technique, the new skulls are fantastic.\nThe incredible level of detail is fine enough to let you appreciate the animal\u2019s teeth, horns, cranial structure, and more.\nWe\u2019ve even acquired better, Made-in-the-US, 24\" chains. And for those naturalists who love to exhibit Fire & Bone skulls rather than wear them, we\u2019ve refreshed the design of the species label on the optional wooden display stands. \nTHE NEW COLLECTION\nAnd members of any and all wolf packs should note that our Gray Wolf skull is now available as a set of eye-catching cuff links.\nEach piece in our second collection is available in solid white or yellow bronze, or sterling silver.\nEvery piece can be worn on the included chain or exhibited on one of our optional wood display stands. The display stand is made of beautiful walnut stained birch and lacquered for protection. It is optional and not included with every reward tier. \n3D Scanning & Miniaturization\nOur process begins by digitally scanning real animal skulls. We work with a company that uses a proprietary 3D scanning process to digitally capture animal skulls in very high detail. We are thrilled with the level of detail we get from this method, which isn't possible with consumer-level 3D scanners.\nWe scale the piece down to a size suitable for collection or jewelry. Because we do this digitally and not manually, we retain an unprecedented amount of detail from the original skull.\nTo make the final pieces, we reproduce the miniature model in wax with a professional level high-resolution 3D printer.\nWith our wax model we make a master mold which allows us to cast the skulls in any metal using traditional lost-wax casting.\nWe work with a family owned foundry in the U.S. with decades of experience producing large production runs of small delicate pieces.\nREWARDS\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nThe experience of our first Kickstarter project was better than we could have imagined. We accomplished everything we hoped to, including opening a successful online store, selling our skulls in some world renowned Natural History museums and, being able to source rare skulls from extinct animals - but we want to do even more!\nOur passionate, amazing backers from the first campaign gave us feedback that we are thrilled to incorporate into the new collection. Things like improving the articulated jaw, better chains, and adding birds and a dinosaur specimen to the Fire & Bone family. Now we want to take it to the next level! Your support allows us to keep building this project and adding amazing specimens and one-of-a-kind accessories to our collection. We are happy that we have not had to compromise our commitment to a beautiful, high quality product. Another campaign lets us expand with the same integrity. We\u2019ll source more highly sought-after skulls, including more dinosaurs and other fossil specimens, and we\u2019ll be able to explore more types of products in addition to pendants and cufflinks.\nIn particular, we found that gaining access to dinosaur skulls was more difficult and expensive than we had anticipated - one of the most important uses for the funds from this campaign will be to scan more of these delicate and prehistoric specimens. With your help, we\u2019ll be able to make even more amazing things in the future!\nThanks again!\n-Jason, Chris, & Matt\n(Our thanks to our friends at LAUNCHPACK for their help with this campaign!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere can be production challenges associated with any manufacturing project (delays, equipment failure, theft, etc.), but we've been through this before and have a lot of confidence in our ability to fulfill this campaign in a timely fashion. We have built a strong working relationship with our foundry and are supremely confident in their ability to meet any level of demand.\n\nAnother unique challenge for us is that molds wear out over time. We have a lot of experience in jewelry design and metal casting, and we know how to plan for this.\n\nAs many people have discovered, 3D scanning, design, and printing all require expertise. We are veteran users of these technologies and have worked in many high-stress situations to develop great products. Fire & Bone is not just a passion for us, it\u2019s totally in our wheelhouse.\n\nLast, it's important to bear in mind the difficulty of getting access to more dinosaur bones for future castings - we definitely need your help to have a chance to scan more of these specimens.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "ALL NEW COLLECTION AVAILABLE NOW!", "update_content": "OUR FOURTH COLLECTION IS NOW LIVE!\nIf you haven't already, check out our newest Kickstarter featuring eight new animals and three new giant 3D printed display skulls.

Soldiers would burn the excreta of wolves to create a smoke signal atop the tower. Other towers would then be able to spot the smoke signal from afar, and then create their own smoke signal which would pass the message further along to the next tower, and so on.\nSmoke is a signal!\nIn the modern world, people use mobile phones to communicate. We are inundated with social media notifications. At the end of the day, those notifications are just like the smoke signals rising from the top of the Wolf Tower - messages.\nMix your favorite aromatic essential oil in the mist.\nTechnical Specifications\n  Easy to Use\nThe iScent requires only two steps to set up. First, open up and pair with the iScent App. Next, choose the app that you want to trigger your iScent from the list below. After setup, it isn\u2019t required that the app run in the background, even after rebooting your phone.

Switch to the party mode, and you will have iScent blow off equalized mist as you speak, sing, or if you want to\u2026 scream!\nPrototype\nIn making our prototype, we have employed fused deposition modeling (FDM) to create iScent on a 3D printer. After printing, we install a rough circuit. A bluetooth module is used to control the atomizer and to communicate with an mobile phone. A button switch is used to simulate the Home button, and an amber LED displays the tower\u2019s status.\nOur tests have shown that the circuit works perfectly. Everyone on our team has an iScent on their desk, having integrated it into daily life. The practicality and entertainment provided by iScent is enjoyed by everyone. \nProof of Concept Implementation\nMist Test\nA Classic Model\nThe Wolf Tower may be ancient Chinese history, but we\u2019re keeping old traditions alive in making our model. We have made reference to many castles around the world and chosen one which is both classic and blends in well around the office and at home.

However, the menu will be varies with other emphasis on wings, pasta dishes, submarine sandwiches, specialty dessert, and beverages. The Panther Pizza Box is in the process of organizing their state certified LLC, as well as pursuing an available beer license from the State of Ohio. The Panther Pizza Box will provide the area by broadening the food choice compared to those restaurants locally in the town of Delta and the surrounding areas. Additionally, acquisition of a bee license would make The Panther Pizza Box the second pizzeria in the neighboring towns of Swanton and Wauseon to offer beer. The Panther Pizza Box will also offer delivery services to geographic areas extending east to Swanton and west to Wauseon.\nMARKETING STRATEGY\nThe customer base of the Panther Pizza Box will derive from the geographic locations notes above (Swanton to the east, Wauseon to the west). Location of The Panther Pizza Box on Airport Highway (State Rt. 2) will provide an advantage over four of the other six competitors. The Panther Pizza Box will have substantial exposure because of its location on State Rt. 2. The name, The Panther Pizza Box was selected partly in order to assist in taking advantage of this exposure. Marketing studies showed this name to be easily remembered and recalled by anyone who has seen or heard the name. The Delta location is also ideal for timely delivery routes to both Wauseon and Swanton. Both pizza restaurants in Swanton and Wauseon stay within their town limits for delivery which creates a substantial advantage for The Panther Pizza Box. It will be able to serve all three of the aforementioned towns without compromising quality of product or delivery services (which national marketing studies, has been shown to be the primary reason for a consumer to discontinue purchasing product from a specific restaurant/pizzeria. Advertising has long been both a boon and a curse to the pizza industry. Only Marco\u2019s, of the present competition, has truly utilized advertising in a manner that has been shown to increase sales. Two of the remaining four pizza establishments essentially do no marketing while the other two market on a haphazard, inconsistent basis. The Panther Pizza Box intends to attract a youthful to middle aged demographic with designs and images initially drawing them o this location. The Panther Pizza Box will also have an internet site with information designed to create greater exposure and elicit feedback from consumers. This feedback will be utilized in determining direction of further marketing efforts and possible changes in restaurant operations. The company will use a full Point if Sales System (POS). The POS System will allow The Panther Pizza Box to maintain and create information on pizza orders and delivery, product inventory, consumer demographic and financial information. With the exception of Marco\u2019s Pizza, no other restaurant in Northwest Ohio is known to use said technology. Besides providing the above designated information, the system will substantially reduce the time and errors in taking orders and producing the products. It will give an accurate time of pizza arrival to the ordering customer through mapping the time of delivery routes. It will also allow seamless transmission of financial data into reports that will assist in providing direction necessary to administrative decisions. Additionally, it will provide specific information that will provide strong direction in marketing efforts (which, as noted above, have the greatest impact upon sales and profitability). The system will lower costs by increasing efficiency (through decreasing ordering time, speeding product production, improving inventory control and generating financial data) while decreasing possible complaints (associated with incorrect orders/incorrect product charges, poor delivery services and decreasing inefficient services at the site). It is also The Panther Pizza Box\u2019s goal to connect the POS technology to the internet for online ordering therefore, taking advantage of another opportunity which its competitors have essentially ignored. Veteran management, organization in product production and delivery and a customer friendly company image and environment will assist The Panther Pizza Box in separating itself from the competition. The company will also have strength of local appeal. Since the two owners are from the Delta area. This produces a much better appraisal of what the community\u2019s likes and dislikes are about local food service and The Panther Pizza Box specifically. This is a substantial advantage over the major chain restaurant. Small town consumers like to be able to interact with ownership and feel they are a part of their community.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the world of business there are always risks and challenges. A good business owner or manager is always evaluating the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This is how you evaluate your competition, demographics, infrastructure, marketing, as well as your network suppliers. It is important to evaluate not only monthly but also weekly as well. Knowing your competition is key. It is also important to know you do not have all the answers, but to know the how to use tools to get the answers you are looking for. One of our strengths, compared to our competition, is that we have the liberty to make decisions without the long awaited corporate train to decide for you. From past experience, a threat is that when times get tough for our competition they have corporate backing for bail out if they qualify. We have witnessed this in the past. Not only from experience but we made a decision to return to college, not only because of a passion of learning but to sharpen our business skills in the different areas of business and finance.

However, Rahdo did play a full game of Skyway Robbery at GenCon and here are his thoughts... \nPLAY\n\n.\nYou are a passenger on a gigantic airship cruise liner on a tour that will take you to the far corners of the Gaslight Empire. You are also an up and coming criminal mastermind seeking to build a reputation as a kingpin of crime. As the airship progresses to various exotic locales, amazing criminal opportunities will unfold before your eyes. Your task is to assemble the best gang of professional criminals, conduct daring robberies, elude various defenses and protect your turf from other nefarious crooks skulking in the shadows. Earn the most feared reputation and take your rightful place at the top of the criminal world.\nUnlike most Kickstarter Projects, Skyway Robbery has no stretch goals. To borrow a line from Doc Brown, \"Where we're going, we don't need stretch goals!\" Skyway Robbery is totally pre-stretched with the best components we can get -- springy ivorycore cards, thick 4mm punchboard tokens and player boards, beautiful laser-etched custom dice, a huge full-color game board. Skyway Robbery is excellent, right from the start!\nAs mentioned above, there are no stretch goals for this project since Skyway Robbery already comes with excellent components right from the start. Even so, there's room for upgrades, so the Deluxe edition exists to fill that need. In addition to everything in the retail edition, the Deluxe edition includes 122 custom wooden tokens to make your play experiences even more tactile and fun.\nHere's a short video that hits the basic concepts of how to play Skyway Robbery. As any crook will tell you, it takes practice to pick a pocket and get away scot-free, and Skyway Robbery is no different. You'll get nabbed by the constables or ratted out by your \"friends\" more than a few times before you get your air-legs. \nPLAY\n\n                                                                                      The rules are still undergoing fine tuning but you can certainly get a good feel for the game by clicking the header above to download the advanced prototype rules document.\nSkyway Robbery is not a small game and it can't be all black and white, but if you'd like to put in the time and ink to make up a print and play copy for yourself, you'll find everything you need by clicking the header above to download the 245MB zip file.\nFour advance prototypes were prepared with all of the game art and the most current rules and they've been making the rounds to a chain of reviewers in the USA and UK over the last five weeks. As reviews get posted, they'll be linked below. \nI was immediately attracted to this game given how it takes the idea of a train heist and infuses it with steampunk flair, but was even more excited to find all of this serviced by such a fun experience throughout. -- Jason Dobson, Indie Cardboard.\nIn this edition of The Game of Crowd Funding Written Interviews, we have a returning guest. Philip duBarry was a guest on the podcast. He\u2019s a man with several games under his belt. And he\u2019s got another project, Skyway Robbery, on Kickstarter right now. -- Jeff King, All Us Geeks.\nBeing able to choose my actions independently of what others are doing is great. This allows me to see how well I can play a game, regardless of what the others are doing (on a turn by turn basis). -- Jacob Coon, Whose Turn Is It Anyway?\nIt\u2019s got amazing art. What\u2019s very cool about it is that you\u2019ve got variable player powers, as well. There\u2019s a lot of cool interactions, and you\u2019re jockeying with people when you want to get some money, or get more people for your gang, or rat on the other players. \u2014 Dan Patriss, The Geek Allstars @ 2:31:07 mark\nFirestone\u2014Of course, it all comes down to how much fun the game is, right? I thought this had a high fun factor! I enjoyed what I was doing. I enjoyed seeing what cards came out. I enjoyed figuring out which Action cards to play--and in which order to play them. I enjoyed the tension of wondering if I'd get to grab that Loot before my opponents. I enjoyed the theme, and the artwork, and the setting. This was a fun game!\nJeremiah\u2014 Yeah, there really is a TON going on in this game, and it is ALL really FUN! I loved the meta game that takes place when trying to figure out what your opponents are going to do and trying to play your Actions to both benefit yourself and foil their plans--lots of great and fun tension around that! It's a good, solid game that's seriously a ton of fun!\n-- Theology Of Games\nThe artwork for this game looks totally terrific and the theme sounds very good fun, there\u2019s no doubt of that. But I wanted to find out more about it and the design and designer behind this game, so I got together with Phil and asked him a ton of questions. Paco Jaen Garcia -- G*M*S Magazine Podcast\nWOW! This Game is gorgeous! It's getting a lot of great feedback and it looks fantastic. -- Anthony Racano, Cardboartd Jungle Bonus Interview Podcast\n...it\u2019s impressive how well the game integrates its themes with its simple mechanics; it\u2019s easily the game\u2019s best feature. For instance, each Location board comes with local gang members and equipment that tailor specifically to the job at hand. This reinforces the idea that you\u2019re actually out on the docks recruiting those assets. Now if they get pinched later on\u2026eh, they\u2019ve served their purpose. -- Ryan LaFlamme, Cardboard Republic\nOff-The-Cuff Gaming is all about showing games and gaming in its rawest form. We're not here to review games or even teach you them - just give you a taste. Skyway Robbery was enjoyable game, clearly shown by the fact we immediately played again! -- Tom Tempest, Off-The-Cuff Gaming\n                          Skyway Robbery is his new game set in a cool steam punk universe with some incredible art and design, you take the role of a criminal mastermind out to bring some robin hood style justice by assembling the best gang of profession criminals and conducting daring robberies aboard airships -- Who Dares, Rolls Podcast Interview\nWhen I saw that Skyway Robbery popped up on Kickstarter. I jumped immediately onto that game because your tradition of those truly rich and thematic games and high quality components is really a great mark for the board game industry. --  Chris, Kick The Habit Podcast Episode 11\nCLICK for PODCAST. We played [Skyway Robbery] again last night as a 4-player game, it was bloody AWESOME. One of the guys barely sat in his seat for the entire game. -- Michael Fox, Little Metal Dog Show\nSteampunk style japes and scrapes? YES. \nIntriguing game mechanics? YES. \nTraveling to exotic fantasy locations? YES. \nStealing treasure. YES. \nGorgeous artwork. YES. \nCharacters wearing snappy clothing!?

Honeycut of the DFW Nerd Nighters interviews Philip duBarry about Skyway Robbery. Learn about the game, Philips design process, the art, and what's next on Philip's design calendar. -- J.R. Honeycut, Back It\n                                All in all I like this game a lot. Gamplay, theme and artwork all complement each other. This, combined with the idea of assembling a crew of professionals to take what isn't rightfully yours makes this game unique in its own way. -- Mathias Heilmann (Heilz on BGG)\n.\nMy name is Philip duBarry, and I\u2019ve been designing board games my whole life. I grew up playing the classics: Monopoly, Risk, Chess, Stratego and various card games. My dad would crush me at these games nearly every night, but as I grew up I started catching on and holding my own. Some of my first games were roll-and-move affairs involving fantastical monsters. In my teenage years, I fell in love with Axis & Allies and later made a few war games.\nAfter college, I moved to Cincinnati where I discovered a thriving Axis & Allies group. One night after a session of A&A, our host brought out a copy of Settlers of Catan. I had never played a game like that before\u2014it rocked my world! I spent the next few years playing as many modern games as I could. In 2007 I was struck by an entirely new idea for a game: something that modeled the political intrigue I read about in a Patrick O\u2019Brien novel. I designed Revolution! Strangely, my family and friends actually wanted to play this game. I took it as a sign.\nI spent much of 2008 making copies of the game by hand and selling them on the Internet. One copy was purchased by Phil Reed of Steve Jackson Games. He called me with an offer to publish the game. So began my amazing adventure of designing board games. My published games include: Revolution!, Revolution!: The Palace, Kingdom of Solomon, Courtier, Canalis, and Family Vacation. More titles will be soon added to this list. Thanks to all the folks who have enjoyed my games! I would appreciate your support of Skyway Robbery, my most expansive and ambitious design to date!\nThere were eight talented artists working on the Skyway Robbery project, and each of them did an amazing job at making their styles fit into the world of Gaslight Empire, first introduced in the game Ruse by Levi Mote and Sarah Sharp. Please take a few moments to visit their portfolio pages linked below. Skyway Robbery would have been a drab game without their wonderful artistry.\nI'm an artist living in the UK where the often rainy water makes great days for painting! I have a love for animation, audio-books and all things medieval. Skyway Robbery has been a great opportunity to crack open the reference books and start sketching, I've loved seeing the mazing work from everyone and hope the backers like it too.\nMy portfolio is here: http://jacquidavisportfolio.blogspot.co.uk\nDescription: I'm a freelance illustrator based out of Northern California! You can usually find my work in books and games (tabletop and online both!). I draw a lot of sideburns, so Skyway Robbery was a natural fit. It was a fun process to see the way all the game characters' personalities came out as the project and art assets progressed. All my fellow artists on this project are so awesomely unique, and yet, the styles all fit together in this game so well.\nMy portfolio site is here: www.kellymcc.com\nI'm an artist with a passion for illustration and character design, cats, and coffee.

Well Skyway Robbery comes with a \"Fun Guarantee\". If you don't like Skyway Robbery after playing it a time or two, just send it back with your full pledge data and contact info and your pledge will be refunded.\n Two adjustments to the shipping and pledges.  \nAll EU rewards will go at the $20 extra postage, so, if you pledge $85 originally, you can adjust that down to $65\nCanada to Canada pledge levels have been added for both the retail and deluxe versions. These levels INCLUDE postage so, if you live in Canada, you should upgrade your pledge level and adjust your pledge amount accordingly.\nShipping is expensive, but customs and VAT are even worse. To help lighten the load for Canadian and EU backers, their rewards will ship from Canada and the EU. You will need to add a postage amount to your pledge level, but you should not incur VAT or import fees when the postal worker rings your doorbell.\nSkyway Robbery was designed by Philip duBarry.\nThe amazing art of Skyway Robbery was directed by Dann May and created by these super-talented artists: Jacqui Davis, Kelly McClellan, Denae Wilkowski, Luis Peredo, Eoghan Cowan, Heather Gross, Daniel Bodinof, and Dann May himself who created the epic game board art. \nCody Jones and Dann May are responsible for the stupendous Graphic Design work in Skyway Robbery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSkyway Robbery has been in development for nearly two years and things on this end are pretty much all worked out. The printer has vast experience with custom dice, thick punchboard, and quality game cards. The artists and graphic designers have done an amazing job on bringing Skyway Robbery to life. The only thing left to acquire is the funding to get the game printed. \n\nYou might be thinking that since all this preliminary work has been done, Skyway Robbery will be printed regardless of the funding, but this just isn't so. If this project fails the art will be sold off for use in other games and Skyway Robbery will go on the shelf of unpublished designs.\n\nAssuming Skyway Robbery does reach its goal, there's a generous production schedule to allow plenty of time for snags and delays. Then, when it is all complete, EU backers will have their copies mail to them from the UK to save the costs of VAT and import fees.\n\nNo one can foresee every possible bump in the road, but with the preliminary work that's been completed and with your patience and support, Skyway Robbery will sail smoothly through any turbulence to land safely on your gaming table.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Last Call", "update_content": "Just a quick update on my Square Meal project.

Imagine, eating any food that you like and getting that true bacon flavor. No need to add bacon on that cheeseburger, just add my bacon essence and it is there.

The fantastic interactive installation shows people that anything is possible, that you don't have to have a degree in engineering to understand how to build a crane, and that back yard tinkering is fun!  Children and adults all across America have delighted in the antics of this old fashion vaudevillian style road show for a wacky and wondrous experience that is as educational as it is a feast for the eyes. Mark Perez built the Mousetrap over a 13 year period and has become an inspiration for backyard builders, makers, DIY'ers, and budding young engineers and physicists.\nWe have three underfunded components of the Mousetrap production that we are seeking donations to ensure the success of this project.  The fourth is a stretch goal that we are personally invested in that would benefit the larger DIY Maker and educational communities.\n1) To complete a much needed retrofit on the actual Mousetrap sculpture and hardware.\n2) To fully develop our STEM curriculum. \n3) To provide direct tour support for NYC and Milwaukee Maker Faires 2014.\n4) To help create a database/network within the Maker Community that would facilitate financial viability for hosting projects where resources are limited  \u2014 this is a part of our stretch goal when we pass the $8,000 bench mark.\nNow in its 9th touring year, the Life Size Mousetrap has taken quite a beating on its annual travels across the United States. The components for the entire 25 ton contraption are unloaded, built, and operated, then broken down and loaded back into a semi-trailer at least 6 times a year. The sculpture's parts bounce around, bend, break, wear out and bolts are lost.   With the massive size of the whole shebang , show budgets never cover production costs (without fail we go out of pocket every year) let alone the upkeep and maintenance required to keep the Mousetrap in action.  We needed a solution to keep the Mousetrap rolling!\nThan the match made in heaven happened, Liquid Wrench of all companies out there stepped up to help the Mousetrap.  They saw potential in me, my crew and what the Mousetrap brings to the greater community.   With a grant from Liquid Wrench and space provided by NIMBY art space,  I began a much needed retro fit of the Mousetrap in the spring of 2014. The task was so large and costly that after 11 weeks of concentrated effort several crucial retro fit items remain unfinished. We have made huge improvements- we rebuilt the Crazy Stairs from top to bottom, and created new art for the chain reaction.  We did tons of welding, sanding, & painting and with the magic of the wheel and axle managed to take an entire day off of our set-up with some strategic streamlining. There is great forward momentum with this retrofit and we are so close to reaching our goal, we just need one last push to make it over the mountain! We need your help to continue the retrofit!\nThe second component of our goal is to further develop our STEM outreach. The acronym STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. It is the process of teaching that integrates these four disciplines to promote real-world experience, teamwork, and the authentic application of technology. Additionally, it also promotes discovery, problem-based learning, and project-based learning. In order to be educated and engaged citizens of the world in the 21st century, everyone needs to know and understand the basics of STEM. \nIn these times of seemingly endless virtual and digital experience, it is crucial for people to have real life encounters with the scientific principles that govern our world. The Life Size Mousetrap offers just that. We showcase the six simple machines and how they work, kinetic and stored energy, and certainly not least of all, gravity! The role of Informal Science Education is critical, a 2009 study by the National Research Council confirms that exposure to Informal Science Education enables students to grasp concepts faster and more easily. \n We have developed a basic curriculum that we share with the educational programs we partner with but we'd love to expand that into video shorts that educators can use when they don't have access to the actual Life Size Mousetrap. We would like to film these when we are set up at the New York Maker Faire at the Hall of science. With all that said, our mission is to use the power of large-scale kinetic art and the six simple machines to prove that gravity still works! \"Physics brought to life,\" I say, and \"lets bring 25 tons of Newtonian mechanics to a city near you!\"\nThe third goal is 2014 tour support.  We are excited to bring the Mousetrap's brand of engineering fun to the Milwaukee Maker Faire this year! A new place to show our stuff after the Mousetrap's 5th year of action at the New York Hall of science for the World Maker Faire.  However,  this is a very costly endeavor and this is how you, the individual $25 dollar contributor, can help make a difference.  Your support will prove that through the power of crowd funding we can bring large art projects to a town near you.\nOur stretch goal to be achieved IF we reach our $8,000 goal and beyond. Year after year, we receive requests to set up this unique contraption at science, and education centers all over the United States. Clearly there is a desire for what the Mousetrap can bring to a community, but sadly 9 times out of 10 the connection never comes to fruition for lack of production funding.  Most organizations can offer about half of what is necessary for a successful production.  That means crew is never fully compensated for the endless hard work the Mousetrap requires, or we simply can't accept the gig. We know that this often is the case for other wonderful exhibits and projects that have the ability to ignite imagination and creativity.  We would like to start a network of resources that Makers, DIYers, Artists, basement scientist, and backyard builders can use to connect and coordinate with Science Centers, Museums, Maker & Mini-Maker Faires, and festivals in the hopes of sharing resources, funding, sponsorships and more to bring life enriching projects to people everywhere.\nFor more Information about the Mousetrap go here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Life size Mousetrap is in its 18th year of existence.

Mark Perez, former army medic turned citizen engineer, put into demonstration a twenty-five ton Rube Goldberg structure that was, unsurprisingly, both extremely entertaining and instructive.

We at Liquid Wrench are strong supporters of all who invest time, material, blood, sweat and tears to see their ideas come to life. That is why we whole-heartedly support Mark, Rose, and the rest of the crew behind the Life Size Mousetrap. Just as we funded the retrofit of the mousetrap earlier this year, we are now supporting them with this Kickstarter campaign. And in doing this, we reach out to all of you who recognize and support your fellow makers' endeavors to consider supporting this campaign. By doing so, you just might find the Life Size Mousetrap at a Maker Faire near you.

Nicole grew up with fond memories of baking with her grandmother and wanted to replicate her \u201csecret\u201d cookie recipe.  After several less than perfect batches, a sink full of dishes and ingredients everywhere Nicole was left tired and frustrated.  She thought to herself, I wish I could just place a bowl under each ingredient canister, push a button and the exact amount of every ingredient would be dispensed.\nTwo patents, an award winning product designer, and a Silicon Valley design and engineering firm later, we are close to making Nicole\u2019s dream a reality with the PantryChic\u2122 Store & Dispense System\u2122.  This product will represent a brand new category in the $2.0 Billion food preparation market but more importantly, it will help people the world over fall in love with baking again!\nThe Baker\u2019s Dilemma \u2013 Why Measuring Matters:\nSo why did Nicole struggle with her cookies that fateful December day?  Whether you are an occasional home baker or a professional pastry chef, accurately measuring ingredients is critical. Due to the chemistry involved in baking, recipes require very precise measurements. The correct balance of ingredients will not only ensure that food turns out tasting great, but also that the ratios of ingredients produce the proper consistency and density. There is nothing worse than spending all your time preparing a recipe, to end up with a sub-par or even worse, an inedible finished product just because you didn\u2019t measure properly.\nWeighing ingredients is more accurate than using volume measures such as measuring cups and spoons, which is why professional bakers routinely weigh their dry ingredients to remove variability.  Despite this knowledge, many American home bakers still commonly use their measuring cups when preparing recipes because it's how they were taught and it\u2019s easier than converting recipes from volume to weight.\nThe Measuring Experiment:\nWe conducted an experiment during a focus group including a mix of casual and experienced bakers. Two volunteers were selected and asked to measure 1 cup of flour from the same canister utilizing the same measuring cup. After each volunteer measured 1 cup of flour, we asked them to place their cup on a scale. What did we find? Each cup had a different weight. How might this affect your recipe? You may end up with a denser, dryer batter, or worse, a cake that collapses!\nPantryChic\u2122 Store & Dispense System\u2122:\nWhy is the PantryChic Store & Dispense System\u2122 Unique?\nThe PantryChic\u2122 Store & Dispense System\u2122 removes all the guesswork for you.  Use the unit of measure your recipe calls for and the PantryChic\u2122 Store & Dispense System\u2122 does the conversions for you for over 50 pre-programmed ingredients!  Now you can get the best of both worlds, accuracy without the complexity. Even better, you don't have all those extra measuring utensils and dirty countertops to clean because the PantryChic\u2122 Store and Dispense System\u2122 automatically dispenses precisely from the canister straight into your bowl.\nHow it works:\nPantryChic's Advanced Technology - Bluetooth\u00ae \nThe recipe preparation workflow has changed and computers, tablets and smartphones have become fixtures in the kitchen as more and more consumers go to the internet to look up recipes.  As a result, we thought it would be essential that Bluetooth\u00ae technology be integrated into the PantryChic\u2122 Store & Dispense System\u2122.\nBluetooth\u00ae integration takes the user experience a step further by allowing users to control their Store & Dispense System\u2122 and facilitate a \u201crecipe walk through\u201d with Apps built for their various devices.  This will allow the user to:\nUse their tablets to control the device\nEasily 'walk through' a recipe with Apps that will instruct the user to insert each canister in the order the recipe calls for so it can dispense the proper amount of each ingredient without the user having to program anything into the system.\nTrack frequency of recipe use\nModify and store recipes according to user preferences\nDevelopment Progress:\nWe completed breadboard and \"proof of concept\" testing to identify the most efficient and effective dispensing mechanism...\nWe leveraged 3D Printing to test parts and build a Functioning Prototype...\nWe are fine-tuning the functional prototype to get it ready for tooling & manufacturing\nFood Preparation Appliance Market Opportunity:\nLike many entrepreneurs we began this journey trying to solve a common problem but through research we have found that the PantryChic\u2122 Store & Dispense System\u2122 represents a new category in a very attractive market:\n\u2022U.S. food prep appliance market grew 5% to $2.0B in 2012 (3% unit growth to 31 million units)*\n\u20222% unit CAGR through 2017 to 34 million units*\n\u2022\u201cFoodie culture,\u201d slow economy and healthy eating trends have contributed to growth*\n\u2022Countertop mixers grew 8% in 2012 to 2.0 million units*\n\u2022Popular wedding registry items*\n*Euromonitor International, February 2012\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBaking has been around since humans learned to grind wheat and corn into flour.  Most of us eat at least one baked good every day, whether we start the day with pancakes, eat a sandwich for lunch, or spoil ourselves with a delicious cookie or cupcakes.

Without bees, breakfast would be bland, lunch would be limited and dinner would be dismal. Bees pollinate more than 100 types of crops in the US, from the almonds in your granola to the berries atop your favorite dessert.  Over 75% of the food we eat is originally pollinated by bees. Yet US honey bee colonies are dying off at an average annual rate of 29.6%.  \nSince learning more about the plight of the bees, I\u2019ve personally become very interested in helping the cause.  At first I planned a small plot at my own house, but after further investigation, we've shifted the focus to instead restore a much larger 3.6 acre plot of family owned land near Cannon Falls, MN. We\u2019ve worked extensively with the Xerces society (WWF of invertebrates) to understand the best seed mixture and application method.  If you decide to donate to this worthy cause, you will be restoring native prairie to a part of the country where it has largely disappeared, helping recreate critical habitat for endangered bumblebees, bees, and butterflies.  \nThis plot will never sprayed with harmful pesticides again.

It's stainless steel, dishwasher safe, and easy to use.\nIf you are already buying live-culture fermented foods, you know how expensive that can get. Kraut Source encourages the DIY, artisanal spirit by enabling home chefs to create gourmet fermented foods, economically.\nKraut Source is designed for singles and families of all sizes. It fits on wide-mouth Mason jars, so you can make pint, quart, or 2-quart size batches. It takes up little space, so you can have several batches going at the same time. Its elegant, streamlined design means that it will look really nifty on your counter top.\nNaturally fermented foods like sauerkraut and pickles are gourmet superfoods. Whether you are following a raw, vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, paleo, or somewhere-in-between diet, eating fermented foods on a daily basis is good for you because they contain probiotics, enzymes, and vitamins.\nThe Problem\nWe started fermenting the old-fashion way with a big crock and a rock to keep the vegetables submerged underneath the brine.  The \"crock-n-rock\" method was inconsistent, as some batches turned out good, and some spoiled.  The batches were so big that they could feed a whole village.  Then we also had to transfer them into many jars that cluttered up the fridge. Plus they were all the same flavor. Boring!\nWe wanted to make different varieties, try different spices, but it wasn't possible with the big crock. We also tried other methods ( such as filling a big plastic bag with water to keep the vegetables submerged, or using an airlock, or a jar within a jar) but there was no solution that was simple, elegant, and consistent.  That's why we created Kraut Source.\n The Solution\nSuccessful lacto-fermentation requires 3 fundamental steps:\nCarbon dioxide produced by the fermenting bacteria must be vented. If not vented, the container can actually explode.\nFresh air must be kept out because the health-promoting lactobacilli bacteria are anaerobic. Fresh air allows undesirable microbes to grow, tainting or ruining your ferment.\nThe vegetables must be kept completely submerged in the salt-water brine because exposed vegetables can rot.\nKraut Source beautifully fulfills these requirements:\nKraut Source uses a water moat to provide a one way seal that lets carbon dioxide escape.\nThe same water moat keeps new air from entering.\nKraut Source uses a compact spring press to push down and submerge the vegetables. The spring press works better than a weight (stone or glass hockey puck used in other fermentation systems) because the spring exerts several times more downward force.\nBesides fulfilling the basic requirements, Kraut Source does more:\nConvenient. It fits onto a wide-mouth mason jar, so when your fermentation is complete, just remove Kraut Source, attach a regular lid, and place in the fridge for storage.\nAttractive. It has a sleek elegant design that looks good on your counter top.\nDurable. It's made from heavy gauge stainless steel.\nFood safe. Stainless steel and glass are two of the safest materials known.\nConsistent. Produces batch after batch of gourmet quality fermented foods.\nHow it Works\nWatch the video below for detailed instructions on using Kraut Source to create tasty, nutritious fermented superfoods.\nPLAY\n\nEndless Variety\nThere are endless varieties of fermented foods.  Nearly every culture has invented their own favorites. (German:sauerkraut, Korean: kimchi, South American: curtido, India: chutneys). Kraut Source opens the door to variety and creativity.  Impress your guests with unique homemade gourmet fermented recipes that cannot be found in any store.\nPlease help us reach our goal\nWe spent almost 2 years designing and refining Kraut Source.

My baking business, Laughlin's Bakery, has already been up and running profitably out of my home for over a year. We have hundreds of customers and have already reached thousands of people through our pop-up bake sales, busy catering schedule, and donations to local events and organizations. But it's time to move it into a physical retail space - one with roots in (and ties to) its neighborhood. Because I live in the artistic and vibrant Short North of Columbus, Ohio, I'd love to see my business established here, too. \nBut because of the large up-front costs associated with starting a bakery (even a small one), we're going to need some help! Just buying used equipment for a basic operation will cost me at least $20,000. Then there's the store itself. I'm planning to lease, which will be about $1,000 a month minimum in this area. In addition, there are the costs associated with outfitting a commercial space for its purpose. I'll need a small fleet of people (architect, contractor, inspectors, etc.) to get the joint ready for you guys. Many of the critical parties have already been identified and are ready to break ground on this project.\nA lot of the planning is contingent upon having the dough (not the yeasty kind) to actually do this, and so that's why I'm reaching out to you. Your contribution, no matter the size, will get me one step closer to making my bakery a Columbus institution that we can all be proud of.\nTHE PRODUCTS\nPeople at our bake sales always ask me, \"What's the best thing you have?\" or \"what's your favorite?\" I always respond in the same way: \"It's all good, and that's why I put my name on it.\"*\nI've spent years testing and perfecting my recipes and techniques, and I'm proud to say that the end results are unlike anything else you can find in Columbus. From my double-glazed lemon madeleines...\n....to my croissants...\n...to my layer cakes...\n...and Old World Christmas cookies....\n...it really is all good! \nI am constantly expanding my menu, but our core offerings can be seen on our full website here. In addition to French and German breads, cookies, and pastries, I am also very interested in American classics - particularly those that I grew up loving in the South. I see no reason why madeleines and my grandmother's fresh coconut cake shouldn't share the same shelf space.\n*for the record, my all-time favorite actually is that fresh coconut cake.\nMY VISION\nThere's no denying that downtown Columbus has a lot of incredible specialty bakeries already. But what's missing is an everyday/all-occasion bakery, the type you can find at the heart of every small European community or town. Admittedly, I'm very influenced by that model - a spot that is in an ongoing dialogue with its neighborhood clientele, and a place where you will want to go for a snack or your sandwich bread for the week just as readily as for your mother's birthday cake. In that sense, it will be a hub of our community. The quality of the products and service, however, will also be excellent enough to attract attention from around the state and country. I firmly believe that.\nGIVING BACK\nSince I began this venture, I have been honored to donate my baked goods to all sorts of humanitarian causes, and that practice will not change once I move into the storefront. I have already made arrangements with BESA Columbus to ensure that our leftover breads, cakes, and cookies will be donated to the people and organizations in our area that need them most. \nCUSTOMER REVIEWS \n\"Nothing but perfection with these cakes and pastries! Jonas uses only the best ingredients...some of which he pulls from his own garden.\" \n\"Always a highlight of any party or event I attended, these cakes and pastries are as much a treat visually as they are flavorful.\" \n\"Honestly the best baking and catering service in the central Ohio area! Jonas is excellent in the kitchen and delivered high quality, tasty treats. All of my guests praised Laughlin's and asked for these treats to be at every party! The service and care received was beyond the expected quality. I will have Laughlin's at every event I host! You should too!\"\n\"Amazing red velvet cake for my daughter's birthday - the pecan frosting really made it special.\"\n\"Took a Buckeye cake to work for a birthday and 7 out of 7 people said it was the best cake they have ever had! It was brilliantly balanced in flavors, and super moist. Our biggest dessert critic usually thought chocolate cakes were too overpoweringly chocolate but she LOVED this one. Highly recommend to anyone!\"\n\"Jonas made an amazing Buckeye Cake for a birthday party I was having. Everyone at the party could not stop talking about how delicious the cake was! Would highly recommend to anyone!\" \n\"Excellent baked goods made with exceptional attention to detail and lots of love. Laughlin Baked Goods never disappoint and always leave your taste buds wanting more. If you haven't indulged in one of these wonderful creations, you are truly missing out.\"\n\"Absolutely delicious brownies. Bought 200 for a graduation party.

Put another way, playing with a BIG DICK just might improve your game. See what we did there? That\u2019s the essence of the BIG DICK brand. A quality product and a marketer\u2019s dream. In addition to our trademarked tagline \u201care you swingin\u2019 a BIG DICK?\u201d, we have many other catchy phrases in the hopper. The fun-inducing word-play possibilities are endless!\nThe idea was one of those ah-ha! moments inspired by friendly trash talk during a softball game! Many of you probably remember the hugely successful \u201cBig Johnson\u201d t-shirts from the 1980\u2019s and 1990\u2019s. This is a similar concept based on creative product design and suggestive wordplay.\nSoftball and other recreational sports bring people together for friendship, camaraderie, competition and most of all FUN! Imagine the back-and-forth innuendos and double-entendres inspired by this uniquely named bat designed to deliver the goods. Let\u2019s face it - you can\u2019t step up to the plate with a bat named BIG DICK and not deliver!\nMarketing isn\u2019t cheap. Manufacturing isn\u2019t cheap. Licensing isn\u2019t cheap. The first goal of the project is to secure funding to be used to promote the product, gather a list of interested customers and approach US-based sporting goods manufacturers with the opportunity to manufacture and sell the BIG DICK brand.\nStep one: Use Kickstarter to secure funds for the purpose of raising awareness to this new and edgy product design via targeted social media campaigns, keyword advertising and the Kickstarter and BigDickSoftballBats.com websites. Potential customers will be encouraged to show interest via our opt-in database of interested customers.\nStep two: Upon successful promotion and market penetration, the hardcore data representing the information gathered via our campaigns will be utilized to lobby US-based sporting goods manufacturers to manufacture and sell the BIG DICK brand. It is our intention to manufacture the BIG DICK brand in the United States.\nIn both steps and in concert with our own marketing efforts and using the funds from our Kickstarter campaign, we will enlist the aid of a public relations agency as well as a professional marketing firm to manage additional campaigns as well as present the brand and data to interested parties for production and sales.\nOur Kickstarter funds will be used to:\nRetain professional, reputable marketing and public relations firm(s)\nTargeted online marketing via social media and keyword pay-per-click campaigns in an effort to build a list of interested potential customers\nPursue manufacturing opportunities with US-based sporting goods manufacturers utilizing the data gathered in our marketing campaigns\nOnce manufacturing has been secured, we envision the BIG DICK brand being sold online via a dedicated website (or websites) with traffic driven by targeted keyword advertising, social media promotion, trade-related websites, print advertising and of course, word of mouth. Because of the racy nature of the brand, it is not intended to be an item sold in retail stores. Online sales of softball and baseball equipment reached $593 million dollars in 2013*. We believe that the Internet provides opportunities to market the BIG DICK brand in ways which have not been available in a traditional brick-and-mortar setting. Below is a broad overview of various channels driving sales:\nDedicated website sales\nSocial media campaigns on websites such as Facebook and Twitter\nTargeted keyword advertising with Google, Yahoo, Bing and others\nSmall doses of print advertising in relevant trade publications\nWord of mouth!\nTargeted online marketing: We will utilize Google AdWords, Bing Ads, Yahoo Advertising Solutions and other similar online marketing options.\nSocial Media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and other social media outlets\n*Statista.com\nPricing has not been determined. However, the BIG DICK softball bat will be exceptionally high quality and compete in the premium category.\nSoftball and baseball bats are highly regulated in nearly every aspect of their design. This is for reasons of safety as well as keeping the playing field (pardon the pun) level. Things such as material composition, weight, length, and how fast a ball can come off the bat are all strictly regulated. Bats on the high end of the performance spectrum will obviously use higher quality materials in an effort to be as balanced and responsive as possible. We fully intend the BIG DICK bat to utilize the best materials to achieve the best performance among its peers in the industry.\nYES! Our intellectual property (trademarks) with the United States Patent and Trademark Office cover all sporting good items that you swing. Future plans include branding and licensing for other items such as golf clubs, baseball bats, tennis rackets and more.\n See the sidebar for Reward details.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first thing we hear when we talk about our brand (other than \"that's freakin' brilliant!\") is \u201cwho\u2019s going to put that on their store shelf?\u201d The answer is simple. As stated above, there is no intention (at this time) to sell the BIG DICK brand in brick-and-mortar stores. Our brand was developed with the sole intention of utilizing the power of the Internet for marketing and sales.\n\nThe other question we hear is that existing manufacturers may not want to associate a racy brand name such as BIG DICK with their company. Although this seems insurmountable to some, we see this as a minor hurdle. Why? Here are the two main reasons:\n\nPrivate label branding: This is very common in manufacturing and the most likely scenario for the BIG DICK brand. Often, companies manufacture products that they may not associate with their own brand or they manufacture products for other companies who then sell the product as their own. For example, Toyota manufactures the Pontiac Vibe, which is the same vehicle as a Toyota Matrix, but Pontiac brands and sells the Vibe as their own.\n\nStand-alone model: In this less-likely scenario for our brand, this is defined as a manufacturer who uses a model name in conjunction with their own brand name. In other words, the BIG DICK line of softball bats would simply be a model offered by any given brand name manufacturer. Think Chevrolet Corvette or Dodge Ram. These are stand-alone models of a single brand.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Swing Big Sports\n2 created \u00b7 2 backed\nSwing Big Sports is based in Columbus, Ohio and we're on a mission to make recreational sports even more fun.

I am referring to the personal photographs taken by servicemen and women during World War 2. While researching my father\u2019s World War 2 history I noticed the abundance of personal World War 2 photos being sold on the open market.  Unfortunately these photos are taken out of the collections and albums that the servicemen and women put together many years ago.  Thousands of Soldiers, Sailors and Marines lugged their personal cameras tucked in beside their mess kits and rifles through the world at war and documented compelling images of comrades and landscapes from a unique and personal perspective.   These pictures show the soldiers as no war photo journalist could.  They show the private moments the goofy times and the tension leading to battle.  Some even show the heat of battle from the viewpoint of the person being shot at.  As the number of surviving men and women that participated in World War 2 dwindle down their personal photographic collections are disappearing. The photo albums, cigar boxes full of loose pictures, strips of negatives, medals, are being sold to the highest bidder.  Unfortunately most of these collections are not being kept intact. Photos are torn off of pages or removed from album sleeves and then sold again individually. The purpose of this project is to take intact collections, preserve them, scan them into digital files, and place them on the internet in an easy to search, easy to download repository for everyone to appreciate.\nABOUT THE PROJECT\nIntact collections I already own will be scanned and digitally saved.  The items themselves will be placed in an archival environment.  The collection author, unit information and any other pertinent details will all be placed in the same digital files.  The digital files will backed up in the cloud in disparate locations to insure their permanence.  \nThe files will then be actively shared with web sites or individuals that commemorate the units if available and placed on the World War 2 photo archive site as a common research point and for anyone to enjoy and appreciate. What makes this effort truly different is that a strong effort will be made to reunite the photos and information in the files to the unit legacy sites.  This will provide a digital canvas worthy of these great images. \nHOW THIS PROJECT WILL MAKE AN IMPACT\nThere are many commemorative and tribute organizations and sites for our World War 2 veterans.  Many of these sites have no visual record of the people contained in the tributes.  This project will in its own way help alleviate that problem.  One success story is listed below.\nZamzam Survivors\nAn example of this effort is the Zamzam Story web site.  The Zamzam was a ship sunk by the Germans in 1941.  The survivors keep the story of the Zamzam alive with reunions, a web site and have authored books on the event. Even though there was a Life magazine photographer on board his camera was taken by the Germans when the passengers were taken prisoner.  So he only had pictures onboard the ship.  I acquired the collection of Charles W. Carr the Director of Operations for the Red Cross in Spain in 1941.  In researching his personal collection of photographs I discovered they contained the images of the Zamzam American survivors arriving in San Sebastian, Spain, on May 31, 1941.  I created high resolution scans of all 33 pictures and a newspaper article About Mr. Carr and shared them with the survivor group.   The photos are now on their website. \nZamzam survivors\nTHIS IS OF IMMEDIATE IMPORTANCE\nThe collections protected carefully over the last 6 decades by their owners are very quickly dispersing, fragmenting and losing their historical context until there will be little left.  Some collections take months to reassemble scouring the internet, estate sales, etc.  Many pieces will never resurface but many do.  The time is now to make a positive step forward to saving these wonderful pieces of history.\nTAKING ACTION\nMy goal is to raise $500.00 to purchase archival binders, negative sleeve holders, photo holders, and a scanner \u2013 printer to help physically preserve and record the images.   As more collections are acquired they will be posted also.  This will be an ongoing process.  The following collections having been acquired and will be scanned, archived, and posted.\nPrivate John Boland Signal Corps attached to the 94th Infantry Division Saar- Rhineland Campaign.\nMajor James Sands executive Officer 3118th Signal Service Group Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force Paris and Frankfort HQ.  \nPrivate Charles M Jones 70th Infantry Division European Theater of Operations. \nLieutenant Commander Bryan Smith Captain of the USS Impeccable AM 320 Pacific Theater of Operations invasion of Okinawa. \nUSS Broadbill AM 58 Unknown Sailor European Theater of Operations, Normandy Utah Beach invasion, Operation Dragoon Southern France.\nBattleship Colorado BB 45 Unknown sailor Pacific Theater of Operations\nSergeant Bob Sadler 72nd fighter squadron thirteenth Air Force, Pearl Harbor, Iwo Jima survivor\nThe exciting progress made in connecting these collections to where they belong will be posted to the Archive site for all to follow.  The personal stories and unit histories will be placed on the site along with the photos to honor the collections and will be available to browse and download.\nREWARDS\nI am offering the following rewards for donations levels listed below.\n5.00 amount \nOnline acknowledgement on the donation wall on the World War 2 Archive website.\n20.00 amount \nOnline acknowledgement and a 8\u201d x 10\u201d contributor card suitable for framing.\n50.00 and above\nOnline acknowledgement a contributor card                                               and a 11\u201d x 14\u201d  project poster.

We have applied to the state of Ohio for a license, but the wait time is about a year and a half before one can be issued by the state. In the state of Ohio, you can be issued licenses to sell alcohol through the state, or, you can purchase them from exiting businesses that no longer have a need for them. While going through the state is the least expensive way, the cost is approximately $1100, the length of time to wait for the license can hamper business. Purchasing the license from an existing business is very fast, (can be as quick as a week to transfer the license), but not very cost effective. Purchasing a license for just wine and beer is usually in the $15,000 range. Now, you may ask, why wouldn't we just wait it out and get the license for cheap? If we do that, we are missing out on introducing new guests to our restaurant because of the lack of alcohol. Friday and Saturday nights are our slowest shifts, and it can be traced to guests looking for a libation, which we can not provide. This also hurts the potential financial side of the business as well. If guests are going to other restaurants to get drinks, and not stopping by Jobu, we are not operating at full financial potential.

I did look through the rules, but perhaps I was so blinded in the excitement of starting a new project or so inexperienced after a summer off that I did not really understand it. Either way, apparently I did not follow the guidelines set forth because my project does not end in a final product. Kickstarter is kicking me out.

From the bottom of my heart, (yes, contrary to popular belief I'm pretty sure I do have a heart), I just want to say thank you. \n\nSO, we've made the $650 needed to apply to every college on the ever-famous list! And send them my ACT scores! And bribe the admissions office to admit the neurotic crazy girl sitting outside the campus cuddling a chemistry textbook!

I have more things to give, and my father has more college expenses that make him sigh rather loudly whenever I mention them. The next one? The infamous college visits!\n\nI would like to visit my top two schools, currently Brown University and Barnard College, before November 1st to decide if/where I want to apply Early Decision. Getting up to Providence and New York is not free however, because as much as I love the wizarding world of Harry Potter I have YET to acquire a portkey or learn to apparate without leaving my elbows behind. I've done some calculations (because what else do we nerds do), and in our little Toyota Matrix it would cost about $175 round trip in gas money. (for those skeptics that don't believe me, it's all calculated here: )  Since that email I received last week that I was an heir to an oil tycoon I had never met in Saudi Arabia turned out to be a hoax, we'll be paying full price for our gas.

Having their produce supply grown within the same city will also reduce costs due to transportation as well as the diminishing effects it can have on the quality of the produce.

With complete climate control, we will be able to grow items that may not be suitable for the local environment.\n\nOnce our business has expanded, additional assistance will be needed within the company.

This is what we will do with everything we raise over the $40,000:\n1. We are going to build a cookbook library (open to anyone). Shelves, books (oh the books!), and buy some comfortable chairs.\n\n2. If we get to $50,000, we are going to build an official demonstration kitchen station so all makers and guests can have the best experience with the cooking classes, workshops, and more. There will be equipment (the more money, the better this part will be) so our food and drink makers (and you!) can record quality demonstrations, vlogs, cooking shows, etc. \n\nOkay... here is our story:\n\nFood brings people together, nourishes bodies and souls, and creates a wealth of economic opportunities for everyone from local growers to cooks, bakers, and roasters. The Commissary is a place created especially for people that love, work with, and live all things food and drink.\nThe Commissary is:\nA commercial kitchen, storage, and event space for hire;\na co-working space for food makers;\na base camp for small businesses; and\na connection point for the Central Ohio food community. \nIn the beginning...\nThe Commissary began as an idea of where culinary student Kate wanted to be instead of classroom kitchens.\nKate: When I was in culinary school, I had dreams of opening a butcher shop that would make stocks, sausages, and basic mise en place out of local ingredients. I wanted chefs and farmers and produce companies to be able to experiment in that space. I plotted out all of the parts of the business that I still needed to learn before jumping in, and then life intervened. I\u2019ve worked my way through that list since. \nWhen my first son was born, I made all of his baby food with ingredients from my favorite farms. I looked into selling the food at a farmers\u2019 market, but regulations require all frozen foods be prepared and stored in a commercial kitchen. At the time, I couldn\u2019t find any restaurants that were willing to let me rent space in the off hours. The light bulb flickered back on and ever since I have been making plans and meeting people who need this space to happen just as much as I want it to.\nAt first, The Commissary was going to be in a gorgeous space on Town St in Franklinton, but after some time I had to acknowledge that the fit was not right. At the same time, Steve and I started talking more seriously about a partnership.\nSteve: For nearly a decade I worked in an asset management office where I provided financial, administrative, and compliance services for a number of independent representatives. Essentially, my job was to enable those representatives to focus on the core aspects of building their businesses. For all of those years, I drove by 1400 Dublin Road every day and imagined the possibilities of that space. After a big career change into the food truck world and time spent working next to other truck owners, I realized that many food makers need that same sort of back office support and 1400 Dublin Road would be the perfect place to make that happen.\nTogether, we have made The Commissary a place where the possibilities include: \nEntrepreneurial chefs can try out new dishes and gain the experience they need to open their own restaurants with substantially less financial risk. \nCooks and bakers will be able to teach a variety of classes covering everything from theory to hands-on techniques.\nEstablished restaurants can experiment with new concepts or create special meals for a select clientele without disrupting their establishment.\nCommunity organizations, companies, and decision makers can meet, taste, network, and work on ways to make our city safer, happier, and more delicious.\nEntrepreneurs can share their experiences, ask questions, and get support from the community.\nThere are so many more things that can happen, like team building activities, community outreach, networking events, private parties, photo shoots and marketing, and on and on\u2026\nIn creating The Commissary, we want to contribute to the energy and momentum of the food community in Columbus and open doors to growth as yet only imagined. That said, it truly does take a village to get our dream off the ground, and we couldn't have gotten this far without all of those people who believed in us, helped us get established, and continue to help us grow. We look forward to a lifetime of bringing people together over food, and to growing our list of partners\u2014both in profession and in spirit\u2014day by day, week by week, year after year. We hope you join us.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have been working on The Commissary for a while. When we began planning out all of the spaces in The Commissary, another business was partnering with us to complete a spectacular tasting room/event space. When they needed to slow their timeline down and ultimately pull out of the project, we were left with so much possibility and not enough room in the budget to make everything happen. Be our partner! Let\u2019s work together to make this exciting space a reality. \nConstruction is really progressing on over 2000 sq ft of kitchen space, an experimental brewery, and roasting space; the storage space for equipment, trucks, carts, and inventory; co-working office spaces; and more. We need you in order to create the belly of the business: a space for the community to gather, network, learn, collaborate, taste... \nA quick peek at our plans (note: these drawings are a few months old and some great changes have been made, including a bigger common space)\nThis Kickstarter fundraiser is all or *gulp* nothing: if we don't reach our goal, we will not receive any of the donations pledged, your credit card will not be charged, and the special dining events we have planned will not happen as scheduled. If we do reach our goal (yay!), your credit card will be charged when the campaign ends on July 10th. To the right you'll find a list of rewards and special dining events for different levels of pledges. Please help us take this space from a dream and turn it into a reality! \nHow will the money be spent? \nWhere we want to end up (the top) and where we are right now (the bottom)\nWe have a 1200 sq ft construction zone to convert into a community space before anyone gets to gather and dine: \nTables and chairs\nChina, glassware, flatware\nLighting and interior finishes\nAV equipment \nDemonstration equipment\nBeer taps and cooler\nLicenses and permits\nIt all adds up. The more we can gather, the more we can share with the diverse community that will fill this space.\nWe will be working with local craftsmen and craftswomen (and some successful Kickstarters) to make this community event space perfectly local. For example, Griffen Hollow Studios has been designing tables that will make you want to pull up a chair. They will also be carving the names and messages of each of our supporters into wooden spoons to be hung up in a great big public display of our affection \u2013 I mean art. Affectionate art, perhaps. Alison Rose will be screenprinting some swag. Valerie Starr is one of the local artists that will be filling our walls with lovely art. Igloo Letterpress's beautiful prints will beautifying our walls (and possibly yours too!).\nThe architectural plans have already been approved and construction of the kitchens in The Commissary is moving so fast. We have food makers committed to fill this event space calendar with all manner of special dining experiences. \nWhen will the parties start? \nJune/July: Construction of The Commissary continues. \nAugust: Fill the kitchens with equipment, the event space with tables, pass our final inspections, and host a helluva grand opening party! \nSeptember/October: Special dining events begin! \nThank you for taking the time to learn about The Commissary and our fundraising campaign. We are so excited about seeing this space transform into a gathering place for the community and are grateful for your support.

These are a few risks to The Commissary's community space:\n\nKitchen incubators are fairly young as far as business concepts go. We have done extensive research, toured several facilities around the state, and talked with even more around the country. We have made many of our business decisions and forecasts by drawing on our business experiences, feedback from our networks, and this research. However, we don't know enough about the long term challenges for kitchen incubators to know what we don't know yet. \n\nWe are building a business based on serving small businesses. Their problems are our problems. We want to create an environment that presents those businesses with many opportunities to grow and thrive. To do so means that we can only be as successful as the businesses that fill our kitchens.\n\nMarble Cliff is willing to take a chance on a kitchen incubator and food truck base camp in their safe village boundaries. The Commissary will need to prove itself as a good neighbor to any that may be nervous we may be too loud or smelly.

We have our eye on a certain area in our space for a cookbook library. During last night's tweet-up, we decided that any cookbook library would be incomplete if we did not also have a cake pan library.
