[{"backer": "Derek Nolan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "ShadowCast is the simplest way to play console games on your computer. TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.  Eddie, Chris, and Andrew miss the good old days of gaming accessories that truly improved the console experience such as the Game Genie, GameBoy Light Magnifier, and Guncon.  But we didn't do this alone, and there's a lot of people to thank for bringing this project to life:\n Alex Miller for developing our fantastically optimized Genki Arcade app \n Ben Lau for teleporting all the products to our backers\n King Sun for helping us put together this hectic fast-paced crazy video\n Roanna Wong for holding down the fort of customer inquiries \n Yin Xiao for the fantastic product design support, you're amazing\nAnd of course, we want to thank backers like you. With your crowdfunding support we\u2019ve been able to operate as a quirky indie hardware developer free from outside investors. This means we can keep our focus on designing innovative human things we believe in without compromises.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nbraag - A boutique pre-launch to post-launch marketing agency leveraging data-driven customer acquisition to fuel record breaking Kickstarters.\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

By now the risks are less of us being able to make the product but more likely if we deliver on time. One of the biggest chunks of time is always the pre-production phase which includes tooling/mold production, test molds, and securing components. This time, we\u2019ve actually gotten a lot of the work done before launching the project which means greater financial risk for us but a lot less timeline uncertainty for our backers. We're happy to say we're even better equipped to face these challenges but no matter how much we plan there\u2019s always a chance that things can go wrong. Whether its production, logistics, or completely random events, we promise to always share with you full transparency on our hiccups and resolve them in a way that keeps our backers happy and proud to keep supporting Genki.\n\nNote: there are some shipping risks now to certain countries dealing with uncertainty such as the UK (Brexit) and new India import tariffs.

Outsmarted is the first board game DESIGNED to support remote play. Perfect in these times when friends and family cannot always be together.  Even better is that only YOU need to own the game - your friends and family can use the FREE Outsmarted app to join your game!\n Fantastic Team / Party Mode. Supporting up to 6 teams of 4 players (24 players). But beware - even in team mode, Outsmarted sometimes selects one member of the team for an important solo question.  \n Localised Questions. The questions in Outsmarted are dependent on the region that you select within the software. At launch the US, British, Canadian and International English versions will be available with further foreign language versions in 2021. \n Play it your way. Outsmarted is as much fun with just 2 players as it is with a huge team of 24!   Play it with your Windows laptop, an iPad, Android tablet or mobile phone. You can share just one device or connect a second or third as well as up to 6 mobiles as handheld controllers (one for each player or team).    \n Almost no learning curve. Outsmarted has almost no learning curve.  The AI hosts the show.  It always knows who's turn it is and which IQ Rings each player / team has collected. Anyone in the family can play straight away.\n Questions by professional question writers. To make sure we have the best content on the planet, we have a small team of highly experienced question writers that have been involved in major TV show question writing.\n A life time of free updates. Outsmarted is the world's first board game that constantly evolves with new surprises and great free new content on a regular basis. It means it never gets boring like other board games tend to over time!\n In game leaderboard. The in game leaderboard at the end of each round shows the positions of all players / teams. It also shows correct answer percentages for each player / team.\n The 3D Genius Miniatures. We have put a lot of effort into the design of the 3D painted miniature genius characters that feature in Outsmarted and they're adorable as a result!! You can see the full line up below with more to come in future versions.  Got an idea for a new 'Genius'?  Drop us a line with your nominee!  \n The Question Store. Outsmarted includes enough questions for hundreds of hours of play. If you need more questions or just want to customise the game with questions about topics you love - no worries!  The Question Store gives you instant access to an amazing library of additional content for free or low cost. \n(** Remote play functionality using the physical board allows people in different locations to play together, either using two physical game boards or for guest players that don't own the game using a 'join game' code. In addition we are developing further remote-play functionality that includes a virtual dice, virtual board and virtual in-game player figures - this will be released as a free update when available in February 2021.)    \nGet Outsmarted to your door in time for Christmas 2020!! We are happy to offer a refund to any backer that doesn't receive their copy in time and wishes to cancel their order. \nThere are two great value versions of Outsmarted available on Kickstarter, offered at a big discount on the future retail price: \nThe Standard Retail Version \nThe Kickstarter Limited Edition Version\n Please select the version you prefer before you place your order.  \nOver 17 million people have helped launch innovative new products on Kickstarter. This includes hit games like \"Exploding Kittens\" - which has gone on to sell 10 million units worldwide!  We've chosen Kickstarter because it's the perfect platform to share the joy of ground-breaking game ahead of its full retail release.  \nThis enables you to get your copy long before it is available to buy in the shops. And even better...  it's delivered directly to your door at a discounted price! \nIf you would like to order Outsmarted in time for Christmas, choose \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" or click directly on the version you would like.  Then fill in your payment details. It's as simple as that. We will then be in touch at the end of the Kickstarter campaign to confirm your delivery address and full order details.     \nIf you have any suggestions for Outsmarted let us know. We will read and reply to every single comment!  \nSeven stretch goals have been unlocked!! \nThere's more than one way to play Outsmarted! From intimate two-player games with just an iPad to the real Game Show experience on a big screen TV.  Which one are you?\nThe Purist - The purist has trouble letting go of that dusty old question pack, but soon realises Outsmarted is just.. a lot better!  So they opt for intimate candle-lit iPad sessions (with the volume set low), playing with their partner or perhaps even a guest or two on very special occasions.\nThe Family Guy - The family guy (or girl!) understands Outsmarted is the perfect way to get the whole family involved. They have struggled to find a game that everyone enjoys playing and their kids spend more time glued to their phone than reality. But with Outsmarted everyone's happy and can compete together, best of all...  their kids are learning without even knowing it!   \nThe Frenemy  - The frenemy is your best friend until they get around a table with a board game. They suddenly change to be uber competitive. They are prone to sending invites weeks in advance - \"How about Outsmarted three weeks on Saturday?\" They make sure their iPhone 11 Pro is fully charged before the game starts because they somehow believe all that processing power and a full battery gives them an edge.    \nThe Show Off - The show off streams Outsmarted to their 4K projector with their 8 speaker Dolby Digital setup providing an arena-like atmosphere. They place a large leather chair in front of the screen and everyone has to take the hot-seat during their turn with a spotlight shining down on them for extra pressure! \nThe Control Freak - The control freak runs Outsmarted on their Windows laptop and streams their laptop screen to the TV. They then act as a TV show host using their mouse to control the game. They can be heard frequently saying \"Is that your FINAL answer?\" & \"That's the WRONG answer!\"\nThe Party Animal - The party animal invites everyone over for a mass team game of Outsmarted. Rounding up 6 teams of 4 players (24 total)! They also have a giant trophy for the winners and an endless supply of drinks and snacks on hand.    \nIn Outsmarted there are six Ring Categories, each representing a unique challenge that you will have to master.  Land on a Ring Question and answer it correctly - you win that Ring. Collect all 6 Rings to reach the Final Round.      \nRaw brain power.. this category involves observation, logic, reasoning, pattern recognition and sometimes a bit of quick arithmetic.  The catch is...  it's all against the clock!        \nThis category is about all the things you could or probably should have learned at school. Questions cover - History, Geography, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, English Language and Mathematics.        \nIf it happened yesterday it could be featured in the game today! New content is added to the Breaking News category daily. Questions cover World News, Celebrity News, Regional News, Political News, Tech news, Scientific News and Environmental News.       \nThis category is about pure Trivia.  The questions are similar to those you might find in old school trivia games or quizzes. Crazy facts, unusual events, things you should've known and things you didn't know you knew!      \nNo self-respecting Quiz Show would be complete without a category covering TV, Film & Books. What's great about Outsmarted is that many of the questions in this section include photos and video clips!     \nAnd of course we haven't forgotten Music!  In addition to Musical themed trivia and specialist knowledge, we hope to have finalised a licensing deal by the time of launch which permits us to offer \"name that tune\" sound questions.      \nOutsmarted includes 2,500+ multimedia questions. Perfect for hours and hours of play. This is already way more than most 'card' questions provided by our traditional board game competitors, so in theory the average player shouldn't feel the need for additional questions for a long time.  But if you do get the itch for something new... \nThe in-game Question Store is there for you!  It's a world first.. being able to expand your board game and add exciting new content for years to come with one swipe. \nSo what does this mean for you?     \nMore Questions if you ever need them\nIf you play a lot you will eventually require more questions.  With all of our cardboard competitors that's game over... go out and buy a new game sucker.   \nBut not with Outsmarted!  We can provide you with an entire new game's worth of questions in an instant... and at a fraction of the price of buying a new game!   \nAn entire Core Question Pack of 2,500+ Questions is available in-game from only \u00a36.99 / $8.99. Incredible value!  Incredible longevity!    \nGet exactly what you want\nThe questions categories in Outsmarted are great, but If you ever want more of the kind of questions you really love, you can get them instantly in the Question Store. \nAdd Speciality Question Packs to the existing library of questions so they are added into the mix, or you can switch out a whole category you don't want and replace it with your chosen pack.  What's more, you can do this on a game by game basis in seconds.\nDon't like Breaking News... switch it for the 1990's.  \nDon't like Back to School... switch it for Sports! \nIn fact.. you can customise all the categories to your chosen subjects if you wish!\nEventually, hundreds of Speciality Question Packs will be available, some are completely FREE OF CHARGE and others will start at only \u00a31.99 / $2.49 for lifetime ownership.   \nIf you have a suggestion for a question pack you would like to see in the future get in touch and tell us!    \n\nFocus. A lot of questions are designed to leave you with no time to think. Complete focus is needed from the first second of the countdown to give you the best possible chance. \nKnow when to use an assist. If you go out all guns blazing with your assists, you won\u2019t have any in reserve for the crucial ring questions. Likewise, if a question comes with a significant surprise bonus, it\u2019s often worth using an assist or two to nail that question and grab the bonus.\nStay goal oriented. For example, when playing a fixed time-length game of 60 minutes and there is a tie for first place, the winner could be decided by the number of assists each player has remaining when the time is up.  So conserve your assists  in a fixed-time match - unless you\u2019re going all in on a ring question.\nMake quick decisions. Quite often it\u2019s clear that one or two possible answers are definitely wrong.  When under pressure, quick decisions to eliminate these is often the difference between winning and losing. \nPlot your path. Going for your strongest categories can be a good idea in a fixed time game of 30 or 60 minutes. And if possible, memorise the 'roll again' opportunities so you don't miss them.         \nIs Outsmarted really that much of a leap on its traditional Quiz and Trivia counterparts? We have put together this table to show you all the main advantages.   \nHelp us spread the word about Outsmarted. Tell your friends, your neighbours & your family! With your help increasing our userbase we can more quickly develop major game features and content as well as meeting the incredible stretch goals we are about to announce here on Kickstarter.          \nAll versions of Outsmarted are the same physical boxed product, with the same game board (the board contains no text). When you first startup the Outsmarted software / app you simply select your preferred region to get localised game content and to play in your language. \nPlease check this list below to see what date your native language version will become available within the Outsmarted software: \nEnglish  (United States Version) - Available at launch December 2020\nEnglish (United Kingdom Version) - Available at launch December 2020\nEnglish (Canadian Version) - Available at launch December 2020\nEnglish (International Version) - Available at launch December 2020\nGerman Version - Not available until April 2021\nFrench Version - Not available until April 2021 \nDutch Version - Not available until June 2021\nSpanish Version - Not available until June 2021\nItalian Version - Not available until September 2021\nRegional differences in the English Language Versions\nAll questions included within the International English Version are relevant to all English speakers wherever they are from. In addition by selecting a specific region (USA / UK or Canada) you will get additional region-specific questions added into the mix. For example selecting the US version at install would result in about 30% of all questions served by Outsmarted being specifically about American News, Politics, Celebrities, History, Geography and Sport and so on. \nOther Language Versions\nBackers that speak French, German, Spanish, Dutch or Italian can purchase and enjoy Outsmarted right away in English and then switch to their native language within the software when it becomes available in the future.  \nOver the course of 2021 we may be adding even further language options, but we are unable to confirm which languages they will be at the current time.      \nOur growing team is based in the United Kingdom and the United States and we spread as far as India and the Far East.  Our project creator has been involved in a wide range of entertainment software development, including some of the world's biggest franchises. Every member of the team brings with them a wealth of experience and creativity as well as a shared passion & belief in Outsmarted.  \nOur ambition is simple... To shake up our tired genre and breath new life and excitement into our sector with a roadmap for continuous growth in the userbase, features & content of Outsmarted.  \nThe past two years we have put our lives on hold and risked everything to get here. Outsmarted was too good a concept to ignore... \nThe response of everyone that has helped us during play-testing has been a reward in of itself.  We've seen by their reactions that our game evokes a level of emotion, excitement and involvement that just isn\u2019t possible with traditional board games, Outsmarted is genuinely the gateway to the future of board games... \nNever before has there been a board game with the capacity to grow and expand with new features and content in the way that Outsmarted can.\n\nEven the older generation (our parents) enjoy taking part and the younger players are thrilled that there is now a board game where they can take on the adults on a level playing field...  They don't even realise how much they are learning as they play!\nSo we really hope you will get on board and join us at Outsmarted!  We want your support within our growing community as well as your suggestions to help us make Outsmarted the best it can be.  \nWe are certain that Outsmarted is just about the best board game experience you will ever get for \u00a325 / $30, put simply, as a value proposition it's in a different league to its traditional counterparts! \nThanks in advance for backing us and take care of yourselves.\nThe Outsmarted Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the game mechanics rely on the Outsmarted software and this software development is already complete and has undergone extensive play testing over the past few months. \n\nWe are still working on small tweaks to playability to make the game even better, but, the beauty of software is that we can continuously upgrade & finetune the game experience long after your purchase. \n\nOur game does not include extensive physical parts like some other more traditional board games and we are working with a highly reputable manufacturer so manufacturing issues are unlikely. \n\nOur team has a lot of experience in delivering top level entertainment software and has been involved in some very large projects in the past. \n\nThe only perceivable risk is that due to the current global situation a yet unforeseen issue with manufacturing or shipping means that the delivery date is a little later than anticipated. \n\nIn this unlikely event, we are happy to guarantee to issue a full refund to any backer that does not wish to wait for a new alternative shipping date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur game is software based, constantly updated with new features and content, it can also adapt to a player's preferences. In other words - it is always relevant.\n\nThis greatly increases the product lifecycle and the long term replay-ability aspect - you will be playing Outsmarted for many years to come.\nSustainable materials\nWe have tried to minimise the use of plastic in our design. Aside from the figures and dice, no other plastic is used. It is not yet possible to produce the quality painted miniature figures included with our game in any other material than plastic, as soon as it is, we will switch. Our target is zero plastic!\nSomething else\nIn exactly the same way that a Kindle provides access to many books, Outsmarted provides access to limitless Question Packs and saves a lot of trees. \n\nOver years of play our game could conceivably provide the equivalent content of dozens or more traditional games. \n\nThis is a significant environmental saving in all respects, less manufacturing, fewer chemicals, less transport, less plastic & ultimately, huge savings in the volume of paper / card required.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a323 or more", "title": "Outsmarted -Retail + (Early Bird)", "descp": "\u00a323/Copy (approx $30.50)\nSAVE \u00a312 | Retail Price \u00a335\n(approx. $16.00 SAVING)\n+ FULL RETAIL VERSION\n+ BOX, GAMEBOARD & DICE\n+ 6 X 3D WHITE GENIUS MINIATURES\n+ OUTSMARTED APP & 2,500+ QUESTIONS\n+ FREE LIFETIME SOFTWARE UPDATES\n+ FREE BONUS FUTURE CONTENT INC.

The micro silicone colander, that makes cooking fast, clean and efficient. \nDesigned to fit and work with any size of can (see below for can sizing), SIFTR lets you drain, strain and contain food without needing to make a mess or waste as much water as a conventional colander. Beyond this, we've discovered so many extra uses for it - check them out below!\nConventional colanders and sieves are massive. They're best for draining potatoes and pasta, not for getting liquid out of cans. They lead to a lot more wasted water, when all you need is SIFTR on the can, and a good shake to flush out any residue inside with a small amount of tap water. \nFed up of colanders taking up too much space on the draining board (or dishwasher), SIFTR was created to solve the problem, and we have discovered it can do so, so much more...\nCompact and colourful, SIFTR is made from silicone. This was chosen because its a flexible, food-grade, high temperature material. Each of the water-droplet shaped holes has been sized to allow the maximum flow of water both into and out of a can, without letting any of the food escape from inside. \nThis is where SIFTR began. Sick of using a full size colander to drain chickpeas, kidney beans and tinned fruit, the mission was to develop a miniature version to specifically fit to cans that fully removed all residue inside, leaving only clean food behind. \nA standard can (like the ones shown in this campaign) are officially 73mm in diameter. SIFTR has a bit of stretch so can fit things slightly wider too!\nSince being asked if SIFTR fits to different sized cans, we've been doing some testing and can confirm that it fits to more than the 'standard' 73mm can. \nFor cans smaller than 73mm, SIFTR can be sat on top. For cans larger than 73mm, SIFTR can either be stretched or (for 20oz cans) fit inside the brim. Easy!\nWhat impressed our early testers most about SIFTR is the massive range of extra uses they uncovered - and there are likely many more yet to be discovered! (the cocktail shaker is favourite!)\nSo far one of the best-rated extra uses is using SIFTR as a citrus-fruit juicer - just place half a lemon or lime inside and crush with your hand to catch the pips but release all that juice! (or hold above and catch the pips like shown in the example below!)\nNo one likes blocked drains, or leaving a greasy mess behind when you place a utensil on the side. SIFTR has been used to solve both of these problems!\nYou can even use SIFTR to open lids on tough jars, as a basket to poach eggs (the egg white can't escape from the holes once it starts cooking!) or as a herb-infuser to place inside a pan of boiling water (silicone can handle really, really high temperatures!) \nEasy to clean (handwash or dishwasher), SIFTR's compact size makes it perfect for every kitchen - big or small. Too often utensil drawers are crammed and extracting a colander can send pots and pans crashing to the floor - not a problem with SIFTR!\nSIFTR is available from launch in five colour options. (The light grey features in both Trio bundles)\n- Coral Pink, Apple Green, Light Grey - The Tricolour Set\n- Dark Grey, Medium Grey, Light Grey - The Mono Set\nGiven their small size, bold colours and wide range of uses - you can just order a single unit, but really, SIFTR works best as a trio-pack. \nIt has become common on Kickstarter to add in extra goals, beyond the original target. We want SIFTR to be useful for everyone, in every kitchen - so our stretch goals are going to come from you.\nStretch Goal #1 - \u00a330,000. Different Sized Holes\nThanks to the comments and messages from backers during the first week of the campaign, the first stretch-goal will be unlocked at \u00a330k. It will be for the same sizes/colours of SIFTR, but with 3 different sizes of hole for straining/draining smaller things. \nStretch Goal Update #1 - Proposed hole size render. (Holes in the centre will also be shrunk!)\nThe idea for SIFTR started in early 2020. With everything that has happening in the new COVID-world, we found ourselves using the preproduction samples on a daily basis, long before any content was shot. We've all been cooking at home far more than usual, and these sort of kitchen-hack products have really proven their value. \nSIFTR easily pops onto all standard-sized cans to give a nice secure seal, meaning you can shake the contents to get rid of all residue inside without it flying off. \nAt our end, everything is ready to go! The preproduction units you see in the campaign are all from our actual manufacturing partners. We're going to get the tooling underway ASAP and try to get a head start, we just need the support of backers like you to make this project a reality!!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the new Covid-world there are some fluctuations in shipping times and prices, the only risk we have here is the estimated arrival date may be delayed if global shipping routes change. However, at the time of writing the international shipping prices (and times!) are closer to the pre-covid levels, so this is why we feel the time is right to launch now.\n\nFor manufacturing, all of the units you see in the campaign are actual silicone made from prototype moulds with our actual manufacturing partner. They've been absolutely fantastic so far and are keen to get started. We are as ready to launch as possible and excited to get these out to backers all round the world!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe're confident SIFTR will never need replacing.

It's fast and it's easy which makes for there hardly ever being a lineup in public restrooms. But, of course, there is a downside and... it is a messy one. \n Inevitably we all experience a simple law of urination physics:  when we pee, our height + flow speed + porcelain + water =pee splashing-fireworks. \nThis results in residual pee in and around our toilets, pee drips, pee spray, and toilet crud build-up.\nAs part of our mission of designing products that help alleviate the small, yet common stresses we encounter in the day to day, we've designed the Piss Pad. \nThe Piss Pad is a highly dense, diffusing target that attaches to the back of your toilet bowl to diffuse urine splashback. Its robust and functional design is the first in-home urine splashback tool of its kind. \nAt a total thickness of 15mm and a diameter of 40mm, the PissPad is a non-intrusive design that remains in your toilet providing minimalistic splashback protection.\n Installing and removing the PissPad is simple: simply peel, place, and stick. Because we've used microsuction waterproof adhesion, you can rest assured that your PissPad will stay anchored to the porcelain of your toilet.\nWant to remove it? Simply peel it right back off. No residue will be left behind. Easy pee-sy... and you can always reinstall! \n When put to the test, we observed that we needed to clean our toilets 67% less when compared to not using the PissPad! Hello to saving time, money, and toilet paper. Guys... you know what we're talking about: the infamous pee wipe down will be a thing of the past.\n Really, there is nothing like the Piss Pad in the market. From its size, design, and its simple anti-splash functionality, we do really mean that it's the first of its kind for in-home use.\nNo actual urine was used for the making of this campaign. We just thought we should say that...\nBecause of the dense polyurethane fibers incorporated in our design, the PissPad creates thousands of inner channels that restrict liquid from bouncing off the surface and channels urine away without any splash or spray. Aim for the Piss Pad and the work is done.\nFlushing has never felt more satisfying. Once you're done aiming, simply flush as usual and the Piss Pad is rinsed after each and every use. Oh and because Piss Pads fibers are fully sealed, no smells or liquid can cling to its surface. \n Just last year many supporters here on Kickstarter brought PURP (our previous campaign) to life. The feedback after having shipped on time to all of our supporters was phenomenal and we plan to do exactly the same this campaign if not even better.\nWe're New Normal, a little San Francisco-founded company focused on creating products aimed to alleviate the small, yet common, stresses we all encounter day to day.\nWe welcome you to join us on our journey as we create products that aim to do just that, and ideally, lay way to becoming the new normal.\nThank you for taking the time to check out our campaign.

Knives falling off the tray, lids making butter rings on the counter, bulky lids that slid around while carrying, difficulty scooping up butter.  And we didn't see many stylish designs. So we decided to do something about it. Introducing...\nSMARTER BUTTER DISH DESIGN\n MAGNETIC LID - A magnet on the lid keeps the included butter knife with your dish. It also serves as a place to rest a butter-covered knife during use. No more searching for a knife.\n EXTENDED FEET - With most butter dishes, you remove the lid, put it down, and have a messy ring of butter on the table. We designed extended feet to hold the lid off the table so the table stays clean.\n RAMPS - Ramps on the sides of the dish allow you to scoop up butter easier. They also serve as scraping edges to scrape the knife clean. No more pushing butter onto your knife.\n EVERYTHING SECURE - The lid feet lock the lid into the tray and the knife is magnetically held by the magnet. So everything stays together and can be carried with one hand. No more dishes and knives sliding and falling on the floor.\nMagnetic lid to hold your knife\nA magnet built into the lid provides an easy place to rest your knife during use, even with butter on it. Other dishes leave you wondering where to put your knife so you don't get butter on the counter.\nNo more butter mess on the table\nWe designed extended feet under the lid so that any butter mess on the sides of the lid is kept off the table. Most butter dishes have flat lids that leave a ring of butter on the table or you have to flip the lid over before you put it down.\nEasily scoop up butter\nWe designed ramps at both ends of the butter dish so you can easily scoop up butter. Just slide your knife up the ramp. Use it to scoop up cold butter or a soft mess of butter. Then use the top of the ramp to scrape the knife clean.\nCarry lid and knife with one hand\nButter Hub is your \"hub\" for butter. Everything is together and carried easily with one hand. Other dishes are bulky and require two hands to pickup and then you have to go looking for a knife, usually having to take another trip to the kitchen to get your mug or bread.\nEasily scrape knife clean\nWe designed raised scraping edges to help scrape knife clean or transfer butter from one side of the knife to the other.  Other butter dishes are too low and have no edge, making it hard to scrape off butter.\nA lid and knife that doesn't slide off the tray\nThe lid has feet that lock into the tray so that it doesn't slide when carried. And the knife too is magnetically held in place. No more flying knives and sliding ceramic lids.\nFour colors - Black, Grey, White, Clear\nButter Knife Included\nOur included stainless steel butter knife is shaped with a bend to help scoop up butter at a higher angle of use. It works perfectly with our magnetic lid. But you may use your own steel knife. It's best for magnetic contact if it is more flat and not round.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.\nLimited Colors\nDue to the unexpected popularity of this project, we are fairly certain that not all colors will be available to all backers as expected.  Some backers will have to wait an extra couple of months if they want to be certain of a color they want.  For example, it seems that white is much more popular than other colors and we would run out. If we run out of one color, we will give backers the choice of choosing another available color or waiting approximately 2 months to get the color they want.  The first backers to answer their surveys after the campaign will be the first to secure the color they want. We have already begun production of a second batch of BUTTER HUB dishes to cover all colors selections, eventually.

Taking up minimal space, ROTO-Q 360 self-rotating, automating the entire rotisserie process so that all you need to do is set it up, turn it on, and let it do its job. ROTO-Q 360 does not need any power, gas, or fuel to run, so you never need to worry about keeping any tanks filled or charged either. This is the ultimate in rotisserie convenience \u2013 putting healthy deliciousness always within your reach. You can enjoy rotisserie all day long if you want to, and if you are thinking about trying out a new, healthy diet, it may just be the right way to do so!\nRotisserie Cuisine Anytime You Want It   \nWith today's busy lifestyles, people are always looking for ways to cook healthy and delicious meals as efficiently and conveniently as possible. Well, look no further- The ROTO-Q 360 is the solution you\u2019ve been looking for.\nFits into Your OVEN - \"Everyone owns an oven!\" \nBreathe new life into your cooking appliances and start producing 5-star quality, rotisserie-style fare in your very own home with the ROTO-Q 360. \nThe ROTO-Q 360 has been engineered to fit into any home. If you own an oven \u2013 and everyone owns an oven \u2013 you can put ROTO-Q 360 into your kitchen. This is a portable device that you can set up as you need it, even carting it off somewhere else for the night.                      \nThe ROTO-Q 360 is a Money-saving Appliance\nThe ROTO-Q 360 has achieved perfection in cooking the rotisserie cousins while cutting down cooking time by as much as 30%. Since the ROTO-Q 360 brings down the cooking time, energy expenditure is also less which in turn saves your money. Plus, as the ROTO-Q 360 can do all the work, you don\u2019t have to pay for other machines that may make your beautiful kitchen counter look crowded. Thus, you save money again. \nTraditional methods of rotisserie cooking require industrial-style appliances with electric driven motors. These devices are much more expensive (ranging from $250-$600) also not portable and take up a large amount of space in your kitchen not to mention the loud noise created from the fan and motors making cooking experience unpleasant.\nFurthermore, cooking chicken in a crockpot or tray by roasting or baking takes a long time to prep 5-6 hours, and sometimes leaves it uncooked or soggy from the bottom side. ROTO-Q 360 will never cause this problem because it cooks the food from all sides through its 360 degrees rotating mechanism. So there is no need for adjusting, stirring or flipping in the middle of cooking, and no more rubbing more butter or oil.  A rotisserie chicken is likely to be moisture than one that has simply been roasted in the oven.\nKEY FEATURES \nNon-electric design\nHealthier Choice\nEasy to Clean\nEasy to Store \nIndoor / Outdoor\nDurable \nNon-Electric Design \nPatent-Designed Gear Box\nUtilizing a gearbox that stores kinetic energy when the knob of the device is turned, the ROTO-Q 360 does not require any additional electricity or fuel to operate. The cooking time can be set by manually turning the knob a specified number of rotations, to achieve the optimal cooking time for a wide array of food items. \nHealthier Choice - 90% less fat \nAs the food turns, unwanted fats and grease drip down into the drip tray for healthier results, now you can make golden-brown tender-crisp chicken wings and french fries. meanwhile keeping the finger-licking taste and texture of deep-fried cooking with less fat than traditional methods.\nEasy to Clean - Dishwasher Safe \nCompletely non-electric, ROTO-Q 360 could not be any easier to clean. The components pull apart for simple rinsing, cutting down drastically on the clean-up time after every meal. Much easier to clean than a traditional rotisserie machine. \nEasy Store - Space Saver   \nROTO-Q 360 is also easy to store \u2013 even if your storage space is exceptionally limited. The ROTO-Q 360 is a portable device that you can set up as needed, even for chefs on the go.  It folds down into a size that will fit into any kitchen drawer as well, and it will not take up counter space, unlike other bulky food machines. \nDurable & Versatile\nROTO-Q 360 is made with durable materials so that you can count on it for the long term.\nThe ROTO-Q 360 can be used for more than just chicken, It is also suitable for preparing fish, poultry, meat, vegetables, potatoes, fries, and much more. Using our optional attachments, you can theoretically cook an entire meal for yourself on one rotisserie machine.\nIndoor / Outdoor - Enjoy rotisserie on to go \nSimply place ROTO-Q 360 on indoor/outdoor grill or fire pit as a heating source and let the magic of the ROTO-Q 360 rotisserie do the rest. While your food is being cooked, the ROTO-Q 360 will continuously rotate to ensure that your food is evenly cooked throughout. The result is tender, juicy, restaurant-quality, rotisserie-style cuisine.  \nROTO-Q 360 self-rotates, automating the entire rotisserie process so that all you need to do is set it up, turn it on, and let it do its job. ROTO-Q 360 does not need any power, gas, or fuel to run making it the ultimate in rotisserie convenience \u2013 putting healthy delicious cuisine always within your reach.   \nThe entire unit weighs in just 5.5 lbs (2.5 kg), the super-portable size ROTO-Q 360 could easily fit in any backpack making it a perfect companion for hikers, campers, outdoor enthusiasts to carry around.  The compact design of the ROTO-Q 360, makes it convenient to transport the device and attach it to Gas/Charcoal grills, fire pits, etc. for use while traveling, camping, or tailgating. BBQ\u2019s no longer have to consist of just hamburgers and hot dogs, now you can add rotisserie-style chicken, beef, ribs and more to your family gatherings and game day menus.    \nThe ROTO-Q 360 can cook various types of meat, fish and poultry (up to 5 lbs.) in 60 mins. or less. Additionally, by utilizing one of the many accessory attachments available for the device, you can further utilize your ROTO-Q 360 to cook other non-meat food items, such as potatoes, fries, and roasted vegetables (accessory attachments sold separately). \nRoto-Q 360 Setup  \nPLAY\n\nRotisserie in action: speed up 8x \nPLAY\n\nInvented by Susie Wen, the ROTO-Q 360 is the product of years of ingenuity and innovation.

Oven-safe, non-stick silicone dividers that will streamline your cooking and divide your ingredients, to make one-pan meals and meal prepping a breeze.\nEveryone loves sheet pan cooking, but it\u2019s not always as simple as putting everything in the oven together and coming back to find it has all cooked evenly. Reality is, not everything takes the same amount of time to cook. With Cheat Sheets, you can easily remove ingredients when they're ready and never overcook them again.\nWe get it... If you're new to oven cooking, it can feel like a bit of a science experiment that involves a lot of guesswork. That's why we've tested the most popular everyday ingredients and created an easy timing guide so that you\u2019ll get perfect results every time.\nCheat Sheets are made for meal prep. With our modular dividers, you can cook all of your ingredients with even better organization and control. \nYou can fit up to 6x small portions or 3x large portions on a single sheet pan and with multiple sets, you'll have everything you need to prep for the family or a week's worth of meals.\nWith Cheat Sheets you can easily separate ingredients and flavors without having them mingle. Whether you want to use different marinades, cook savory and sweet dishes at the same time, or simply don\u2019t want your food to touch, Cheat Sheets has you covered.\nSeparation also comes in handy for families with different preferences, allowing you to create different portions for those with special dietary requirements or specific tastes - because not everybody likes pineapple on their pizza.\nAluminum foil and parchment paper are hugely wasteful and non-recyclable. Sheet pans are also notoriously difficult to clean, collecting stains and grime with every meal.\nWith Cheat Sheets you'll never have to scrub another sheet pan again and you'll save tonnes of wasted paper and foil. Cheat Sheets are naturally non-stick so clean-up is a breeze. They're also dishwasher safe!\n\nThe Cheat Sheets dividers are made with a premium, food-grade silicone material resistant to temperatures up to 450 degrees F. The dividers will fit on a standard half sheet pan or perfectly on the Prepd Sheet Pan included with each set.\nThe Prepd Sheet Pan is made from Aluminized Steel and coated with a non-stick PTFE and PFOA free coating.\n\nAround 18 months ago we had an insight...\nOut of all the Prepd Pack owners (now over 100,000 people), those who consistently meal prep all use sheet pans. But sheet pans have never changed since their inception. They are hard to clean, require you to constantly waste parchment paper and aluminum foil and are not designed to best serve how we actually cook, ie, multiple items in the oven at once.\nWe knew there had to be a better way. A solution that is easier to clean and gives ultimate versatility to the sheet pan. Allowing you to easily time each ingredient of the meal. A zero-waste solution removing the need to constantly create non-recyclable waste.\nWe were immediately drawn to silicone as it is completely food safe to high temperatures, naturally non-stick, long-lasting and resistant to bacteria. In our first phase of development, we tried dozens of different types of silicone and different colors to ensure our solution would be stain-resistant and have perfect heat transfer. Then we started our testing and prototyping phase. \nThis is where we started cooking meals in the Cheat Sheets to ensure every dimension was perfect and more importantly, food cooked just as well as on a 'naked' sheet-pan.\nWe then opened our first tooling, received FDA approval and did a wider beta test. The feedback was phenomenal all round.After hitting our Kickstarter funding goal we have kicked off all of our final tooling so that production can begin shortly after the campaign end.\n\"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . . \"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . . Cooking for yourself is the only sure way to take back control of your diet from the food scientists and food processors\u201d Michael Pollan - Food Rules.\nAt Prepd we strongly believe that cooking for yourself or your family is the best and easiest way to stay healthy, especially during these challenging times. It doesn\u2019t have to always be health food, so long as you cooked it and know the ingredients, that's enough.\nSince we started Prepd in 2015 it has been our sole focus to help make preparing meals at home easier and more enjoyable. By creating tools and systems to help make healthy living easier, we hope to make healthy resolutions - lifelong habits.\nPrepd was founded by two industrial designers, Chris Place & Will Matters. Together, we have designed and manufactured dozens of products and delivered product to customers all over the world. Our first product together was the Prepd Pack a reinvention of the lunchbox that was launched and successfully delivered to over 12,500 backers on Kickstarter in 2016.\nSince launch, we've grown to a community of more than 100,000 avid meal preppers and talented cooks.\nWe can't wait to go on this next Prepd journey with you!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nOver the last 4 years we have delivered over 100,000 products to customers all over the world.

Align rim with handle notches and slowly rock to open the top\n\nHow Does it Work?\n When the handle is squeezed, it forces the center gear to rotate causing each of the four splitters to synchronously extend towards the rim of the can allowing the Draft Top tool to open a variety of can sizes. \nWatch the Draft Top bar tool opening different sized cans (CAD model shown)\nDurable Design\nThe tool is made of high impact ABS plastic allowing it to withstand the wear and tear of every day life such as:\nA night in a cooler\nAn accidental encounter with your car...

Instead of smashing your nose against the aluminum top, you can smell the aroma of your drink. Not to mention a smooth pour and no clugging which makes you feel full. Or just Send It. \n When will this be delivered? We are anticipating early 2020. \n Do you ship overseas? Yes. Separate shipping rates apply.\n Can you get different colors? There will be additional color options in the future. Sign up for details or contact us at hello@drafttop.com \n Are you able to put another logo on the Draft Top? Yes, but not during Kickstarter. Minimum orders apply. Reach out to us at hello@drafttop.com for more details\n Does it leave a sharp edge? No, the cut occurs inside the rim of the can and folds the aluminum into the rim.  \n Are the blades sharp? No, in fact they are purposefully dull. We call them splitters. Technically they are splitting the metal and not cutting it.\n Will the splitters rust? If left in water for a few days or covered in soda or beer there is a likelihood that they will develop surface rust. They are made of 300 series stainless.  \n Can it be washed/is it dishwasher safe? We don't recommend using it in the dishwasher as it could affect longevity of the tool. We recommend just rinsing it using warm water after each session. \n How long will it last? We've tested samples on hundreds of cans and have prototypes that are still being used well above 1,000 cans \n Does it grab the top? No. If the top falls completely in, you have to flip it on its side and pull it out. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. \n So the top just falls in the can? Sometimes. It all depends on how the tool is used. If it partially cuts the lid, you can use the tool to fold it into the can like the tab normally folds in. \n Isn't the top dirty? Maybe but its the same top that you put your lips on when drinking from the can the normal way. So just Drink Topless! Its a lot better.  \n Does it work on Tall boys? Yes, most 16oz to 19oz cans. It does not work on most 24oz cans or the Fosters Oil Can\n Does it work on crowlers? No - those are good for a nice set of glasses\n How does it work? When holding the tool in either hand, the top right corner has a part of the handle that sticks out. When you push this in the handle opens and retracts the splitters to the center. With the opposite hand holding the can near the top or bottom near the bends, you place the tool on the can and slowly squeeze while starting to rotate. The four splitters move outward from the center when you squeeze the handle. They puncture the inside rim of the can just below the top and split the aluminum open as you rotate the tool. A minimum of a quarter twist is needed to fully remove the top but sometimes it take a half or full twist. Below the handle are grooves designed to allow you to rest them on the rim and push the lid in. Remember, the objective is to open the top not take the lid out.   \n Do you or will you sell replacement parts? Not at this time. \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 950+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $400M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there is always a potential for unknown\u2019s to occur, the only challenge we can foresee at this time is uncertainty of delivery times based on the volume of orders.

Please be careful about any FAKE websites. Kickstarter and CrowdOx.com (our post-campaign pledge management platform) are the only official channels for backing Footloose.\nCleaning litter boxes is certainly an unpleasant routine. But what was your feeling last time when confronted a toilet un-flushed? Gotcha! I mean, felines have a well-earned reputation as immaculate creatures. They need a clean toilet just like we do.\nFootloose is invented to keep your cats' treasure-burying ground always clean. Each time after they finish their business, Footloose starts an 8-min countdown and then initiates a cleaning cycle that funnels all wastes into a tightly-sealed receptacle. All you've to do is to discard the waste bag once in a while.\nOmniClean Technology\nExisting contraptions have failed what they're built for. Most of them break down within a year of purchase. While cleaning, they cause a lot of waste debris or even get themselves polluted. It feels like you would rather just scoop the litter at the outset.\nSo we developed OmniClean technology that actually works. The meticulous fusion of hive-style sieve, curvy funnel, fine-tuned turning speed and powerful torque is a result of our unwavering engineering pursuit. Then with a little blessing of the gravitational force, it turns the arduous frustration into a hassle-free pleasure.\nA Zero-Compromise Solution\nFootloose is a real life hack that embodies our zero-compromise ethos. We invented this system so that you can say goodbye to scooping without compromising on other aspects.\nFootloose is the smartest littering robot you can ever imagine. SiftAutonomy algorithms give it the intelligence to recognize each critter in multi-cat households, distinguish litter from cats, detect its perimeter and monitor waste level. To enable that, Footloose includes 3 weight sensors, 4 position gauges, a 360\u00b0 millimeter-wave transceiver, 2 infrared sensors and 2 powerful computing cores.\nThe Wireless Litter Box System\nAfter unboxing, pair up Footloose with your home WiFi via Smart Config. It'll stay connected thus you can control it in the Petato App wherever you're. Tweak settings that suit you better and do update firmware for new features in the future.\nAccording to veterinarians, potty behavior is a barometer of health. The advantage of scooping is probably that you can check the waste to see whether your cat is in a good shape. But this is the one thing people always ignore until something bad happens.\nWith ActiveTrack, we can now proactively monitor cats' physical conditions. Footloose indicates you when there is an anomaly. Some symptoms are difficult to spot by human eyes but can hardly hide from the robots. For example, increased attempts to urinate with small volumes is barely noticeable by human but can be a serious sign of urinary problems.\nAll data is streamed to your smartphone for reference at any time. We can't generalize a Ph.D thesis topic into several lines here but at the bottom line, these data points are highly helpful for diagnosis when you visit a vet's office.\nThe debate over open or hooded box is unsettled. Though every pet cat is different, it can be inferred from their outdoor equivalents that the need for fresh air, large space, and relatively sheltered spot is universal. It's this cat-centric philosophy that gives birth to Footloose's form factors.\nGood for Small or Old Cats\nTo facilitate smaller or elder cats with reduced agility, a doorstep is provided. Additionally, the upper surface of the receptacle is engraved with a cascade pattern that serves as a step for in and out.\nSympathy for The Weaker\nIf you've two or more cats, there may be a hierarchy in their society. Those who are less dominant may often get harassed while toileting. However, in the raised chamber, they look taller hence are less prone to a fight put up by another aggressive cat.\n100% Safe & Secure\nAll the current self-cleaning litter boxes have one common issue: while the mechanical parts are moving, cats can still get inside, unnoticed. In edge cases, this even leads to fatal injuries, especially for petite cats or other small pets such as ferrets.\nFootloose is totally safe & secure thanks to three layers of protection. As our signature design, the chamber opening closes while spinning, which prevents cats from entering. More proactively, a millimeter-wave detector picks up any motion of pet or kid within the 30 cm range. It stops the machine right away and resumes after the perimeter is cleared. Lastly, if a tiny critter manages to get in from above, the agile weight sensors can pick up even the slightest change and alert the owner immediately. \nLitter box odor is annoying. But Footloose is here to help. Physically, the waste receptacle is concealed as airtight as possible. There won't be any waste exposed in the open air. On the other hand, the stench you smell is mainly ammonia and some sulfide compounds - they get decomposed by a deodorizing unit.\nThe process is known as photocatalysis, same technology used by NASA in space missions. During the process, UV light energizes the catalyst (mainly titanium dioxide, TiO2) rested in the porous zeolite materials, triggering chemical reactions that neutralize the odor at molecular level, and producing primarily carbon dioxide and water as byproducts.\nFootloose works with any cat litter that clumps, as well as silica gel crystals. Our ingenious hexagonal sifting holes are designed to allow litter of different sizes and shapes to pass through efficiently. They're optimized such that no litter will be left out or wasted. When litter returns to the chamber, the pliable sieve lets it fall gently, which minimizes dust.\nWe've experimented all kinds of litter, including the most popular clumping clay. However, we notice that bentonite granules often get stuck within cats' paws. These granules can be swallowed by cats when they are licking the paws. It's very dangerous as clay is non-digestible. As for crystals, they usually have ragged surfaces, which is not ideal for cats because with a large concentration of nerve receptors, their paws are sensitive. Therefore, we use the biodegradable corn litter mostly now. And it works perfectly well with Footloose.\nLitter tracking and spillage are minimized with Footloose. Holes on the doorstep helps stretch cats' paws to get rid of the granules. Also, as cats jump out of the box from above, litter is tracked within a small area outside the single opening, better than all the place in your house.\nWe used almost all self-cleaning litter boxes available on the market. We were confused by those \"more advanced\" models. The buttons, lights, colors, blinks, etc. were overwhelming. Let alone the glitches that require troubleshooting frequently.\nFeatures, from our perspective, shall not override usability. Footloose is equipped with a crispy LED display and only one button. The display shows machine status that is worth noticing, including Countdown, Cleaning, Emptying, Pairing, Error and Full. The button is mostly used for manually triggering or pausing a cleaning cycle.\nInteractions Made Easy\nWe're committed to deliver you the best possible user experience. The functional details are not only ergonomic, but also proven highly useful in different scenarios.\nDesigned to safeguard your furry friends as well as your wallet, Footloose is a one-time investment that saves you both time and money. Paying for custom-made liners, cat litter, waste receptacles, cartridges or other replacements should be an option, not a voluntary-but-mandatory cost to claim the benefits of automation.\nNote: Assume 2 cats. Detailed calculations are available in this shared spreadsheet.\nAt Petato, it's our innovative minds that set us apart. We're a passionate team of designers, engineers and social entrepreneurs who are true ailurophiles. We bring objects to life through creative designs, robotics and artificial intelligence, allowing people to live smarter with their furry friends and turning people's home into a utopia for pets.\nOur Founder Byron always knew he wanted to create disruptive tech to make things easier for pets and pet parents. The idea for Petato began after hearing friends were giving away their pets because of pregnancy or their busy schedules. This led to taking on the challenge of creating an automatic cat toilet that would enable cat owners to take better care of the fur-kids. Prior to founding Petato, Byron spent 3 years and contributed to its skyrocketing growth at DJI where his last role was the project manager for Matrice drones, FlightHub and other commercial application products. He was also the lead DJI rep of the SkyFund through which an ecosystem around drone platforms was developed from the ground up.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've completed design for manufacturing & assembly (DFMA) reviews. The next step is to create the tools that are necessary to manufacture different plastic parts of Footloose. Given the size of it, the biggest tool we're talking about will be as long as 4 ft in one direction. In contrast, a tool for your earbuds is just the size of a Coke can. Tooling cost of Footloose is about $300K. Though we're committed to deliver this product whatsoever, it'd be helpful to have a clear visibility of how many units we need to produce in the first batch.\n Video by Launch Light Films\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $235MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re dedicated to delivering a flawless product, and you can rest assured that we'll do everything to fulfill your expectations.

In fact, there's over 10,000 free games to stream on the Internet Archive alone--all of which play full-screen and full-speed, thanks to our exclusive streaming technology.\nHere's a list of just some of the FREE games you can stream:\nInternet Arcade - Defender, Q-bert, Out Run, and over 600 more!\nConsole Living Room - Pitfall, Frogger, Star Wars, and thousands more!\nSoftware Collection - Oregon Trail, Wolfenstien 3D, Donkey Kong and over 10,000 more!\nDon't worry if these games run slow or poorly on your home PC, our streaming software technology allows them to run at full-speed without glitches.\nStart digging around your closet or garage for those old games, because it's simple to add your cartridge titles to your Replay. Simply take a photo, and our Cartridge Analysis & Recognition Tool (CART) will identify and add it to your list of titles, it's that easy. It works with iPhone, Android, Kindle, Mac, PC\u2014anything with a web browser and camera.\n The controller included with the Replay DX automatically connects when turned on, so you never have to worry about connecting your controller, plus it functions as a mouse and keyboard. If you want to use your own controller or add more players (up to 4) the Dreamcade Replay recognizes over 100 gamepads.\nOur joystick configurator not only lets you reconfigure your gamepad to suit your preferences, but it also allows you to add new controllers with ease. With the Replay there's never any rebooting required; new controllers are automatically recognized and ready to play within seconds.\nDream Arcades continuously updates and improves the software used on full-sized arcades. You'll have access to the same exact software used on those arcades. Best of all, we are always working on adding new emulators and other features to the Replay. You do have the option to opt-out of these free upgrades.  \nOur support is unrivaled, we can even remotely connect to your machine and fix it over the internet.\nBecause the Replay runs Windows 10, it supports thousands of apps and programs. Plus, the Replay comes with dozens of the most useful ones, like: Windows Store, Netflix, Amazon Video, and YouTube (we are not affiliated with these companies).        \n    When it comes to emulation, CPU power is everything. Running quad-cores at over 2.2GHz turbo means the Replay can not only handle emulators, but also more recent titles like Street Fighter 4 and Counter-Strike. Our open system allows you to expand and hack to your heart's content.\nThe system comes with an Intel Processor, 4GB RAM, Bluetooth, wireless and Ethernet networking, 32GB storage, USB 2.0 & 3.0, HDMI, VGA, and the ability to expand with up to 3 additional storage devices.\n  Don't compare the Replay to a Raspberry Pi. Pi based machines run at half the speed, and can't run as many emulators--like N64, or Playstation--without lots of stuttering. Additionally, they run freeware, limited front-ends. Our front-end has been designed from the ground up for ease-of-use and powerful customization.\n International Backers:\nDon't see your country listed?

Michael has been working with overseas manufactures for over eight years and knows the ins-and-outs of manufacturing and importing. While there is risk with any project, we have the experience, to make the Replay a reality.\nWhile prototypes are being sent out to the media and bloggers, the Replay is not yet a complete product.\nThe layout of one of the PCB\u2019s may need to be changed to accommodate the molds. But the most critical and time consuming part\u2014 the initial design\u2014is complete. We are currently beta testing software and hardware. \nLike any project, one of the biggest risks is unexpected delays. Overseas manufacturing works very differently than in the US, and delays are sometimes unavoidable. We\u2019ve lined up multiple manufactures to minimize the impact of any delays and are committed to keeping candid communication on our progress with backers. \nWhile we\u2019re experienced at cost forecasting, there\u2019s always a chance that some features might be modified or excluded. The online social experience still has to be finalized. \nOverseas orders could face issues or additional costs in local customs. Dreamcade llc has the experience to properly fill-out customs forms, but we cannot guarantee there won't be customs delays.

Everyone's been waiting on the big patch to address the outstanding issues that some Replays are having with some TV's, and some controllers. Due to its size, we have separated the patch into two sections. After testing we released the first of the two patches about two weeks ago. Everyone should now have it whether or not they are in the early adopter's program.\nThat first patch addressed several little bugs like Vsync in MAME and N64 sound. The second half will address issues with configuring controllers. Specifically, it will connect any Xinput controller to the Replay without having to do any configuration. Since most modern controllers use Xinput, it should make the process of adding and connecting controllers much simpler. However, if you have an older controller, you can still use the configuration you setup, or create a new one."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Patch update", "update_content": "I apologize it's been so long since our last update.

We\u2019ll be posting some polls on the community site to get backer feedback on what changes are most wanted.\nThis new update is a major overhaul, so it\u2019s going to take several months to complete.

The issue with this is that many of them seem to be stuck in \"Amazon Limbo\" and we aren't sure we can get them returned in a timely fashion. Without getting many of these returned we won't have enough Replays, controllers, & accessories to ship the remaining orders.

Those are 5 of the regular spoon sizes pictured against 8 of ours :)\nWith Polygons, you are able to find the size you need in seconds, without searching through all of your drawers. Plus, the spoon lays completely flat until you need to use it.\nWhen designing Polygons, we wanted to focus on making our product not only durable but also better for the environment than traditional measuring spoons.  \nThe hinges of Polygons are made of TPR, which have the property of being able to flex a 100,000 cycles without failure.\n(Edit: Many of you have messaged us asking for a 10 year warranty card... The life of such a composite plastic product depends on a variety of factors such as usage patterns, abrasion, temperature, humidity, product abuse, etc, other than just the number of times it\u2019s hinges can flex\nThe product may not live till 10 years, or it might even probably far surpass it\nIt would be like determining the lifespan of a person based on how well his/her joints function)\nAdditionally, with the 4-in-1 design, Polygons eliminates the need for excess plastic and metals that traditional measuring spoons use.\nThe materials we use to create Polygons ensure all ingredients fall off the spoon with little effort. They ensure that the ingredients you use do not stain or stink up your Polygons measuring spoons.\n\n(The images showing the folded spoon resting in place without being held by a hand, are staged photographs... But we see that people want some facility to be able to hold the shape in place without having to hold it, and we're working on it! - covered in the November 17th update)\n A sneak peek of our early prototyping processes \nNumerous configurations & geometries were tested using paper during the ideation stage, then manually tested with a variety of materials\n3D volumetric determination & construction \nWe tested several manufacturing methods to see which one would be optimal for a product of this nature\nShown in this video is one of these early methods, with very basic tooling without any fineness\nPictured in the campaign video is a prototype with similar functioning to the production version -\n (thickness & features exaggerated for explanation)\nThe production version has a similar appearance from the top, and the hinges slightly wider at the bottom, for the softer, flexible TPR to have surface area for a robust bonding\nThis is what gives the product an almost flat, easy-to clean surface both at the top and bottom\n\nWe haven\u2019t pictured the nitty-gritties and manufacturing technique of the production version in more excruciating detail to protect our IP, exactly due to instances like these, which we\u2019ve been citing as a concern early on:\nhttps://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/new-design-cheap-Polygons-The-Flat_60551273844.html\n\nApparently, what you\u2019ve pledge $10+ for, is available for 1/100th the price \nOr is it? The particular seller has listed other popular products on Kickstarter as well, stealing the same images \nYou place a bulk advance order, and then never receive anything (we tried it out with this guy)\n\nPolygons was created in 2014 by Rahul Agarwal. An India native, Agarwal is an inventor, designer and teacher.\nHe's worked on products ranging from the simplest of stationery to complex, head-up display systems.\nA few years ago, as a design student at a renowned Indian university, he was given this advice by a senior \u2013 \u201cDo not tackle designs that have reached the final stage of their evolution. For example, a spoon.\u201d From that point on, Agarwal dedicated his efforts to reinventing the wheel when it came to this object, and the idea for Polygons was born. After extensively testing with various shapes and materials, he arrived at an optimal geometry.\nOver the past couple years, Polygons has won various design awards and thousands have expressed interest in the invention. For the inventor in Agarwal, there could be no greater satisfaction than to see people using what he had created, so he got to task.\nPlease help us spread the word :)\nThe larger the Polygons community, the better it'll help us make the best kitchen gadget ever!\n A big BIG shoutout to Tali, for the delicious photographs\nhttp://www.talidovrat.com\n\nAnd the friends, family, loved ones and kind strangers who've helped us make this happen :)\n\nAnd also...\n...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you like the product, the only risk you're bearing is that of missing out on a true piece of delight by not backing it!\nNo but seriously, as with any new project, there are always some risks associated with manufacturing and supply chain logistics.

You will never have to spare a second thought of where to rest your saucy spatula when you need to free up your hands or walk away for a second to season your cooking.\n                 Features\n\n'L' HOOK DESIGN - Our one of a kind hook design at the bottom of our product will give you a brand new and simplified cooking experience.

Nonstick silicone body is easily cleaned, without staining or accumulating odors.\nSize: L 11.75\" x W 2.2\" x H 1\"  \nWeight: 2.9 oz/ 80g\nQuality and Function\nThe Material  \nWe've given much thought and put in great care into the design of Le'Cook from the inside and out. After rigorous research we found that the best internal structure/core for our Spoonula is Nylon material. Originally we had our heart set on stainless steel for its strength and durability; however, it was too heavy, absorbed too much heat, and was too bendable - not very practical attributes to serve our purposes. We decided that the nylon core is most suitable for our needs of creating a lightweight and easy to handle kitchen utensil. It also didn't absorb as much heat as other materials, which is ideal for our product.\nAs for the exterior, through further trials and error we ultimately decided that Silicone would be the best option for Le' Cook. The material is so flexible and easy to clean. You can gently yet effectively scrap anything from your frying pan without leaving any scratches on the surface.\n Why you need our spoonula\nWooden cooking tools can burn easily when rested too long on the side of a heated cooking pan. It tends to scratch the surface of cooking pan when you try to scrape the leftovers from the bottom. \nSteel cooking tools can easily become scorching hot when left in contact with the surface of a heated pan for too long. Similarly, this material will easily leave scratch marks the surface of most cooking pans. \nNylon cooking tools tend to melt when they reach certain temperatures if rested on the edge of your heated pan. Nylon material is also quite fragile and easy to chip.\n Functionality & Versatility of the \"L\" Hook  \nThe 'L' Hook was designed with an idea of facing gravity - the weight of the handle will help this Spoonula balance to the side of your cooking pan with ease as the hook secures to edge. We tested Le' Cook with a variety of cooking pans and pots, and it works beautifully. Le' Cook Hook work best with a 90\u00b0 edge angle cooking pan.\nTimeline\nStretch Goals \n We will unlock new color options for each stretch goal reached!\nColors for the actual Spoonula may vary slightly from the tones shown on the computer screen.\nThe Story and Idea\nI love cooking and experimenting with recipes almost every day. As I was preparing dinner one evening, the usual problem arose when it came time for me to season and spice up my dishes - I didn't know where to rest my saucy spatula.\nThat is when I start looking online for spoon rests and spatula holders. I ended up loving the idea of pan spatula holders - the moment I saw that product and how easily it clips to the side of your pans, I bought it without a second thought. However, this product still takes up room and needs to be cleaned separately after each use\u2026 \u201cI wish there was a utensil that combines the pan spatula holder and the spatula itself - that would be amazing\u201d ...the thought hit me!\nPan Spatula holder + Spoonula = Le' Cook Spoonula\nThat was me about a year ago. From that day I made a lot of sketches and drawings trying to combine both cooking spatula and pan spatula holder into one solid high quality product, and that is when the idea of Le\u2019 Cook Spoonula was born!\nWe have designed and printed a 3D prototype. Shortly after we produced a sample and tested the mock up in our kitchen to make sure the functionality of the hook and the material meets our standards.  \nHow you can help us reach our goal? By selecting any one of our rewards we offer so we can start the manufacturing process for Le' Cook and meet the required minimum order quantities.\nMore shapes and designs are coming in our next campaign, please let us know what kind of cooking utensils you'd like to see the 'L' hook on the most! :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor us, Kickstarter is a platform where we can show our innovations, and it serves as a starting point of our product to be recognized in the market.

Originally we had our heart set on stainless steel for its strength and durability; however, it was too heavy, absorbed too much heat, and was too bendable - not very practical attributes to serve our purposes. We decided that the nylon core is most suitable for our needs of creating a lightweight and easy to handle kitchen utensil. It also didn't absorb as much heat as other materials, which is ideal for our product. \nAs for the exterior, through further trials and error we ultimately decided that Silicone would be the best option for Le' Cook. The material is so flexible and easy to clean. You can gently yet effectively scrap anything from your frying pan without leaving any scratches on the surface.\n\n\nWhy you need our spoonula\nWooden cooking tools can burn easily when rested too long on the side of a heated cooking pan. It tends to scratch the surface of cooking pan when you try to scrape the leftovers from the bottom.\nSteel cooking tools can easily become scorching hot when left in contact with the surface of a heated pan for too long. Similarly, this material will easily leave scratch marks the surface of most cooking pans. \nNylon cooking tools tend to melt when they reach certain temperatures if rested on the edge of your heated pan. Nylon material is also quite fragile and easy to chip.\n  Functionality & Versatility of the \"L\" Hook \nThe 'L' Hook was designed with an idea of facing gravity - the weight of the handle will help this Spoonula balance to the side of your cooking pan with ease as the hook secures to edge.  We tested Le' Cook with a variety of cooking pans and pots, and it works beautifully. Le' Cook Hook work best with a 90\u00b0 edge angle cooking pan.\n  Rewards\nLe' Cook Apron\nBe sure to treat yourself or the family chef to our full coverage aprons as well. The Le' Cook Apron is made from 50% Polyester and 50% Cotton. The thick fabric is machine washable and easy to clean.  With an adjustable neck strap, ties long enough to be tied in front, and 3 spacious front pockets, this apron will be a perfect addition to your kitchen.\n2 Color Options\n Pledge options\nClick here, like our Facebook page & Share our post to redeem your Facebook only combo pack!\n           Timeline\nStretch Goals \nWe will unlock new color options for each stretch goal reached!\nColors for the actual Spoonula may vary slightly from the tones shown on the computer screen.\nThe Story and Idea  \nI love cooking and experimenting with recipes almost every day. As I was preparing dinner one evening, the usual problem arose when it came time for me to season and spice up my dishes - I didn't know where to rest my saucy spatula.\nThat is when I start looking online for spoon rests and spatula holders. I ended up loving the idea of pan spatula holders - the moment I saw that product and how easily it clips to the side of your pans, I bought it without a second thought. However, this product still takes up room and needs to be cleaned separately after each use\u2026 \u201cI wish there was a utensil that combines the pan spatula holder and the spatula itself - that would be amazing\u201d ...the thought hit me!\nPan Spatula holder + Spoonula = Le' Cook Spoonula\nThat was me about a year ago. From that day I made a lot of sketches and drawings trying to combine both cooking spatula and pan spatula holder into one solid high quality product, and that is when the idea of Le\u2019 Cook Spoonula was born!\nWe have designed and printed a 3D prototype. Shortly after we produced a sample and tested the mock up in our kitchen to make sure the functionality of the hook and the material meets our standards.\nHow you can help us reach our goal?  By selecting any one of our rewards we offer so we can start the manufacturing process for Le' Cook and meet the required minimum order quantities. \nMore shapes and designs are coming in our next campaign, please let us know what kind of cooking utensils you'd like to see the 'L' hook on the most! :)\nMEDIA\nIf you are interested to write something about us, feel free to contact us anytime via email LeCookproducts@gmail.com\nWe will provide a Dropbox link to our image gallery, thank you\n.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor us, Kickstarter is a platform where we can show our innovations, and it serves as a starting point of our product to be recognized in the market.

When running, I try to keep my mind off of the monotony by thinking of problems.  Both my wife and I had recently complained to each other about collar stays.  She was complaining about finding them everywhere and I was complaining about never finding them(the key to any great marriage is communication).  A couple more treadmill sessions later and I was ready to go to the whiteboard.  Having done some initial research and confirming the lack of existing IP, I met up with my friend Eric in February and pitched him the concept.  Eric was very familiar with the issue and was up for the challenge, so we got right to work.\nDesign and Development\nWe started the project by defining our functional requirements, then working through material and design details in creating our initial concepts.

Why? Not enough plugs where and when you needed them? \nToday's solutions for this problem are to rewire your home, hire an electrician to install more outlets, cut sheet-rock, spackle and paint, use bulky solutions like power strips, or unplug and re-plug constantly. These are just mediocre solutions that we've all come to accept.\nNOT ANYMORE, in just 5 minutes you can install theOUTlet and always have extra outlets at your fingertips. theOUTlet can double or even triple the number of outlets in your home; hidden until you need them.

Opening to the left, right, or even vertically for baseboard applications.\nInstallation is extremely easy. There are three simple color coded screws as well as text to guide you through the process. Not only clearly labeled live, neutral, and ground connections but also white, black and green text for the wire colors.

So yes, we will have that version too.\ntheOUTlet with 2 USB's is NOW unlocked, upgrade TODAY.\nFor only $7 each, we will include two USB ports into the product for stretch goal #1. Or, you can back the new USB tier as well. See our project update for further details. \nYou may or may not know that all USB ports are not created equal. Ever plugged in your tablet only to see a message that this device is not supported? Or your device is not charging? Here's a great article explaining how USB ports are actually designed to charge at different rates: http://www.wired.com/2013/12/charging-devices-faq/. The USB ports we're including are individually capable of charging at 2 Amps (2000 mA). But if you plug things into both of the USB ports, they'll share that max power and each device will charge at less than 2 Amps. In General, we can charge one tablet or two phones.\nWhy did we design the product this way? In fairness, we did it because of the constraints with the size of our product. As you can imagine we've fit a lot of things into a tiny footprint inside your wall (4 plugs and 2 USB's where there's normally only 2 plugs)! One of our goals from the beginning of the project was to retrofit into as many electrical boxes as possible to make installation as convenient as we could. In future versions we could make the product slightly larger (requiring a larger wall box) and increase the capacity of the USB's. \nHelp us reach $55k in Funding to unlock Stretch Goal #2  (Colors)  \nWe know that all outlets in all homes aren't white, so at no extra cost to you, we think we should have some color options. You can see some colors in the below image that we know are common in the big box hardware stores. But we want to hear from all of you about the colors you think make sense for your product. So at the end of the project, and once we've unlocked this stretch goal, we're going to send out a survey to see which top 3 colors people want and those are the ones we'll make available. \nWe've signed up with BackerKit to make sure we deliver your products in the most effective manner!\nWe are the type of people that represent why Kickstarter was founded.

Two years ago, we designed WIDE BODY, the first silicone strap built specifically for the original Pebble. We launched it right here on Kickstarter. And last year, we introduced SHANK for Pebble Steel. Our simple goal with our watch straps was to make Pebble smart watches look great and work great. Now we\u2019re doing it again with HAMMER.\nDesign\nHAMMER is wider. The HAMMER strap is 28 mm wide. Time\u2019s stock straps are 22 mm wide. We were able to fit the wider HAMMER on Time by designing a couple of notches into our straps. We grew HAMMER wider so that it seems to extend directly from Time\u2019s lugs. Rugged. Sport watch. Solid. Bad-ass. You\u2019ll find your own way to describe it. HAMMER just makes your Time look great.\nFeatures\nHAMMER is extremely ventilated. If you run or do anything else that makes you sweat, HAMMER\u2019s vent holes transform Pebble Time into a true sport watch. And on the long side of the strap, some of the vent holes double as buckle holes. Because those buckle holes run all the way up the strap, HAMMER is extraordinarily adjustable. It fits great on both large wrists and small wrists. HAMMER is also waterproof. Run with it. Sweat on it. Wash your hands. Swim! Go nuts.\nMaterials\nHAMMER is made from silicone. Silicone is the same material used on Time\u2019s stock straps, and it is prized for its softness and flexibility. It\u2019s strong, too. The buckle is made from brushed stainless steel. And stainless steel quick-release spring bars allow you to swap straps whenever you feel like it!\nColors\nWe're going to make HAMMER in five different colors: black, white, red, citrus, and camouflage. Most people choose black. That's just the way it goes. It looks awesome! White is white. Red will match as closely as possible to the color that Pebble uses on their red straps. Citrus is our own vibrant lime color. And camo is just plain bad-ass.\n Here is some video of Pebble Time (in white) and HAMMER (also white).\nKickstarter\nOur small product development company, UTENSILE, has worked on smart watches and wearables for some of the biggest brands in the world. But we love to do our own accessory products, like HAMMER, too!\nAnd that\u2019s why we turn to you on Kickstarter. We\u2019ve taken the project through pre-production prototyping. The samples look pretty good, right? Now, to get HAMMER into full production, we need your help.\nWe know that most people who will back this project are also Pebble Time backers, so you already know how this works. Your pledge will fund our production tooling, assembly, logistics and many of our other product development expenses. In turn, backers will be rewarded with our watch straps.\nHere's a side-by-side composite photo (we only have one Pebble Time so far!) that shows HAMMER straps and regular straps. After careful analysis, you should be able to conclude that HAMMER straps are wide, ventilated, and awesome.\nGenerations\nFinally, Check out that photo down there. Those are three generations of straps from all of us at Richard Tracy Brand!

What if we were to tell you that we've taken that whiteboard experience and converted into a notebook that helps you generate great ideas where ever you go! Not only that, but you'll never have to waste a single sheet of paper ever again when you have a half baked idea you just want to scribble down somewhere. We call this product the Wipebook and we think it may just be the last notebook you ever buy! Check out Wipebook.com for more info!\nWe've spent the last few months developing our newest dry erase film that we call Hypergloss. This new film makes the erasing and reusing the Wipebook a significant improvement on previous versions. The goal of this Kickstarter is not only to update the Wipebook with our new Hypergloss film, but we also want to test out new variants of our products with real time feedback from backers like you. \n Our last Kickstarter was a fantastic opportunity to get constant feedback and develop great products and we're hoping to create a similar collaborative environment again. Here is what we are launching:\nFormat: Case Bound with Hard Cover\nPage Quantity: 24 Hypergloss dry erase pages\nSize: A5 format (5.875\" x 8.25\")\nRecommended Markers: Staedtler Correctable or Dry erase markers\nDescription: Wipebook 3 is the latest and greatest Wipebook. This Wipebook is case bound and includes a completely new film, giving this book a beautiful look and feel. Not only that, but the Wipebook 3 Hypergloss film makes writing incredibly smooth and clean. Best of all, erasing is much MUCH easier than before. This is important because if you want to reuse a Wipebook over, and over again, the easier it is to erase the better it is. However, if the pages are too erasable, the writing may smudge between the pages. This is why the case binding is used to keep the pages tightly bounded together.\nJust add 5$ to your reward to receive a workbook of your choice! ( you can add as many as you wish, just add 5$ for every extra book)\nFormat: Saddle Stitched Workbook\nPages: 4 Hypergloss dry erase pages\nSize: Letter format 8.5\" x 11\" OR A5 format (mini)\nRecommended Markers: Staedtler Correctable or Dry erase markers  \nDescription: These simple 4 page workbooks are ideal if you need a very lightweight work area to brainstorm, generate ideas or solve problems. They are saddle stitched in place and come in 4 different variants ( mini, ruled, grid and blank)\nFormat:  Detachable ProClick binding with 40pt hardcover\nPages: 25 Hypergloss dry erase pages\nSize: Letter format (8.5\" x 11\")\nRecommended Markers: Staedtler Correctable or Dry erase markers\nDescription: A lot of people enjoyed the form factor of Wipebook 2, with its large pages and detachable binding, so we've decided to keep this form factor while improving the erasable film to our new Hypergloss formula. Pages are 8.5 x 11 and the book includes 25 pages (50 sides).\nSize: Letter format (8.5\" x 11\")\nDescription: To give your Wipebook 2 the same look and feel as Wipebook 3, we are introducing a new accessory for Wipebook 2 called the Wipebook Folio. The Folio protects your Wipebook, detachable binding and gives it a sleek new look and feel.\nFormat: Pack of 10 unpunched pages\nPages: 10 unpunched Hypergloss dry erase pages\nSize: Letter format (8.5\" x 11\")\nRecommended Markers: Staedtler Correctable or Dry erase markers\nDescription: Wipebook Paper is the most economical way to get that Wipebook writing experience. Instead of binding the pages, we give you individual pages that you can punch in whatever binding system you currently use. Pages are 8.5 x 11 and are made of our Hypergloss film.\nLuckily we have been able to work with 3 different manufacturers to produce Wipebooks in order to mitigate quality control risks. The technologies used can be found in many large scale printing facilities, and our patented UV formula is applied on different stocks of paper. \nManufacturing can normally be done with a 2-3 week lead time for production. Luckily we've already run a full batch of products ahead of time to iron out the manufacturing kinks. Production also has all of our digital files in advance. It really is just a matter of pressing the big red GO button.\n                                                                                                        Frank Bouchard: Frank is the creative torque of the duo, initially came up with the Wipebook prototype. He completed his Masters in Engineering Management  at the University of Ottawa while working full-time for the school\u2019s Adventures In Engineering program. The final Wipebook product \u201cfeel\u201d was heavily influenced by his laid-back, easy-going attitude. Team Wipebook really hopes that you can enjoy the smooth flow of the marker on the wipebook's pages as much as he does.\nToby Maurice: Although he may be the old man of the team, Toby is definitely a man child at heart with endless energy. Toby holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Carleton University as well as a Bachelor of Applied Science in Chemical Engineering and a Masters in Engineering Management from the University of Ottawa. He is Team Wipebook's Logistic's master, handling everything from getting patents in 3 months (record time!), trade marks and keeping the books straight. \n                                                     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first Kickstarter was full of challenges and issues but we've learnt so much from that experience. We feel more prepared since we have our infrastructure for shipping and manufacturing figured out ahead of the campaign. That being said, there are always challenges, and here is a list of a few that we could potentially encounter: \n\nIntegration:\nManaging data and orders is always complicated when you deal with high volume especially with multiple products that have multiple variants. This time around, we will be integrating Kickstarter orders with our existing e-commerce infrastructure to streamline the data management. This should avoid juggling csv's all over the place and mixing up orders.\n\nProduction:\nSince the first Kickstarter, we've manufactured Wipebooks with 3 separate printing and glossing facilities to mitigate risk if there are quality issues or pricing issues. Having fallback manufacturers is especially important if we plan to fulfill these quickly. We also plan to print a smaller sample set of books mi-campaign in order mitigate quality issues. If these sample batches are good, we may see some rewards shipping out as soon as the campaign is completed.\n\nShipping Delays:\nThis is most likely one of the biggest challenges. Our shipping provider is preparing for volume shipments ahead of time if ever we reach similar volumes to our first Kickstarter. Our e-commerce platform is also integrated directly with our pick and pack facility, which should avoid having to manually send data, which is always risky. \n\nInternational Shipments & Lost Orders:\nInternational backers beware. The biggest issues we've faced is international shipping. We've had issues with customs and lost packages when we started shipping around the world. This will be mitigated by focusing our efforts on Canada, the US and the EU. Once these are shipped, we will move on to international orders outside of these zones so we can monitor these shipments carefully. We are also trying a new shipping solution for international shipments that should ship within a few days, instead of relying on the regular postal service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Free Journal Pen Holder", "update_content": "Hi all,\nHi everyone!

Adams  \nVeteran game designer American McGee (Quake, Alice, Grimm) and Spicy Horse (Alice: Madness Returns) are set on delivering players a uniquely enthralling \"buy it all\" action role-playing experience. \nAkaneiro: Demon Hunters will transport you to a world realized in a striking visual style inspired by Japanese ink, watercolor and woodblock illustration. We\u2019ve dug deep into the history and folklore of Japan when designing our scenarios and characters. Mixing this foundation with an original mythology inspired by Red Riding Hood yields a fantastic and inspiring setting for players to explore.\nAkaneiro provides players with a unique ARPG of depth, blended seamlessly with the speed and intensity of a pure action title. Combat is fast and unrelenting, but you can sway the tide with careful selection of abilities and equipment. A multitude of character building paths are available, though we've avoided being overly prescriptive, ensuring you can find the best balance of abilities and equipment for your personal play style. \nThe game world is separated in to Regions, which represent a quadrant of Yomi Island. Each Region contains several Areas, each presenting a different environment style and introducing new enemy and boss types. An area contains several missions, forming a small story arc. \nWe want to provide players with an ARPG that doesn't ever end, and doesn't have you waiting around for a year on an expansion that you finish in 2 weeks. After release, we'll strive to push the boundaries of our world further with each passing month. \nAkaneiro has been in development since mid 2011. Our Closed Beta has been running since November 2012. Our target platforms are Windows, Mac OS X, Android/iOS Tablet, and Linux. Both the dedicated PC client & web version will enter open beta in January 2013, and launch to the public as Free-to-Play or \"Buy it All\" on January 25 . \nOur closed beta has been met with high-praise from players and press, who've greatly enjoyed the level of immersion and captivating environments we've crafted. We've been responding to beta feedback with weekly patches and have added many new features since our beta commenced.\nWe've been Greenlit! A Steam version will also be available. In celebration, we've added a new $30 Tier with the Spirit Helper Pet, Karakuri Gaben.\nWe've have managed to take Akaneiro way beyond what we thought originally possible. That has been due to the passion and dedication of a relatively small development team. What's been achieved both artistically and mechanically is fantastic\u2026 but it's just not enough to call the game complete, to satisfy our fans or ourselves. \nWe desperately want the final form of Akaneiro to represent the great amount time and effort that\u2019s gone toward getting it this far. To finish what we've started and present Akaneiro to our players in a truly final state, we need to deliver our promised features to all target platforms. \nThe problem is it's time to launch to PC/MacOS and we feel some key features are missing as well as important platforms. That\u2019s where you come in\u2026 \nWe need to raise $200,000 to support our current team of developers in realizing the most complete version the game. Listed below you'll find out what we earnestly believe is necessary for Akaneiro to truly become the game we know it can be. \nYour backing will guarantee we can include the following: \n The Big Important Additions- \nAndroid and iOS Tablet Version, Linux Version \u2013 We've done a lot of groundwork earlier in development; but we don\u2019t have the resources for a full port alongside our other work. Backing will ensure we can deliver Akaneiro as a cross-platform experience. \nCo-op multiplayer \u2013 Join with fellow hunters in real-time to take down the Demon Kings of Yomi. Share the reward and tackle more difficult challenges.\nEquipment Crafting System \u2013 collect raw materials from fallen enemies and use them to add specific properties to equipment. Apply any properties to any item template, for the perfect blend of stats and aesthetics.\nImproved Community Support \u2013 Any game, especially an independently developed online game such as Akaneiro, relies on fostering a strong community. We need to add more dedicated community managers to our team. \n\n Other Smaller But Collectively Awesome Features- \n\u201cKarma Void\u201d Dungeons - use the crystallized hearts of fallen Yokai to access multi-level dungeons where extra-difficult challenges (and greater rewards) await. \nExpanded Narrative elements \u2013 more in game dialogue, and special ally characters added to certain missions. Lore items scattered throughout the world that provide further story for each mission and the game overall. \nLockbox Items & Additional Consumables \nHand/Fist Weapon Class and Mastery \nExpanded Weapon and Armor varieties. \nAdditional Spirit Helper Pet varieties. \nFurther training levels for all Abilities and Masteries. \nMark of Sacrifice \u2013 Recover a portion of lost experience by returning to the site of your death. Earn bonuses by finding Marks left by your friends. \nGhosts of Yomi \u2013 New \u201clost spirit\u201d NPCs added to Yomi Village, providing repeatable quests for special item rewards. \nLeaderboards \u2013 track and compare a large array of progression stats.\nHunting Squads - organize and brand your characters into a single squad unit, sharing profit, items and other benefits. \nAkane Trials \u2013 Rank-based achievement system with rewards.\nImproved Chat System with friends list management, room creation and other social features. \nIf you believe, as we do, that the game needs these things \u2013 then demonstrate your support by backing Akaneiro. Beyond the financial support, the vote of confidence will do wonders for our team morale as we push toward the finish line. \nYour hunter is a fresh recruit in the Order of Akane. The Order is a Templar like group of demon hunters who fight to maintain the balance between humanity and Yokai (Japanese folk monsters and demons). \nThe blood of slain Yokai crystallizes, forming glowing red Karma Shards. The power stored within Karma Shards allows hunters to master almost super-human combat techniques necessary when facing Yokai. They also receive a high level of training in tactics, survival and natural magic. Order members are often referred to as \u201cRed Hunters\u201d. \nThe Order was founded in Japan, 300 years prior to the events of the game, by the legendary demon hunter and martyr known as The Red Girl - or Akaneiro. Akaneiro was aided by her close companions, the Dark Huntsman and the the Forest Mother. Dubbed \"The Three\", together they exemplified the tenets and disciplines followed by the Order; maintain the balance between human and demon, light and shadow \u2013 walk the shifting line between this world and the other. \nThe setting is late middle 19th century Japan. The game takes place on the fictional Yomi Island, located north of Hokkaido. The island was the site of a great war between Human and Yokai over 300 years ago. Though defeated then, the Yokai have begun to reemerge. This time, they\u2019re more dangerous \u2013 organizing into militarized groups under the leadership of the ambitious and powerful \u201cDemon Kings of Yomi\u201d. \nYomi Island serves as a nexus point for the gathering of karmic energies, used in both natural and demonic magic. The hostile Yokai conquer and control Yomi Island, that they might open a greater rift between worlds. Should they succeed, it will \u2013 quite literally \u2013 be hell on earth. \nAlong with an ever-growing number of hostile Yokai, Yomi Island is inhabited by a mixture of the indigenous Ainu and Japanese. These human inhabitants primarily occupy Yomi Village - a trade and training hub.\nWe are pursuing buy it all model because it offers more flexibility in sustaining the game after release. It's also a great way to expose the game to as many players as possible, broadening our community early on and helping us gather more feedback to improve and iterate as we release new content. \nOur intended buy it all model allows players to purchase our game currency (Karma). Karma is also earned constantly through regular play, so the option to pay is there for those that have less time to invest in daily play. There is no energy system. No hidden subscription, no paying for power.\nWe will never apply prohibitive costs to core game play content or character progression. Nothing will be off limits to non-paying players. \nGo here for a player-written explanation of our F2P model. \nIf we\u2019re fortunate enough exceed our goal the game, and our players, will benefit even more. We have a long list of additional features and content we\u2019d love to expand the game with. \nHere\u2019s a list of our major Stretch Goals: \nLinux Version - Now part of the stated goals. Estimated Delivery Date, March 2013\nOuya Version - $233,000 - Estimated Delivery Date, April 2013\nNEW EXPANSION: EYE OF SPITE\nUnlock the Devil\u2019s Eye Mountain region - 8 new areas and 24 new missions, new enemies, bosses and increased level cap.\nNEW EXPANSION: THE YASHA WAR \nUnlock the Fallen Fen region - 8 new areas and 24 new missions, new enemies, bosses and increased level cap. \nBlackblood PvP Arena \u2013 provided by an Order of Akane splinter group.

You can ALREADY play hundreds of iOS and Android games on the iMpulse, and we're constantly adding support for more games! \nThe iMpulse is cute, tough, and kicks butt.

Love that price tag (:\" SickSilvo (Youtube visitor)\n\"Awesome.\" Jimmy (website visitor)\nThe iMpulse is a great complement to your mobile device/smartphone. Look at the added features you get when you own an iMpulse...\nIt's small enough to fit on your keychain, which is a great place for it, because you can use your smartphone to find your keys! \nWe've also developed a camera remote function, which will snap pictures from the camera in your smartphone. Take self-portraits without that phone in your hand! No more waiting for passersby so you can snap that memorable group photo!\nWe want to keep the iMpulse compatible with a wide variety of devices, and are therefore equipping it with Bluetooth 2.1 (rather than BT4.0, which only works with 3-4 devices available). The iMpulse will work on ALL iOS devices, and current Android devices.\n...and iOS 6, of course.\nWe've also ensured the device is compatible with different PEOPLE.  The iMpulse is ambidextrous, so you don't have to be!\nTwo iMpulse controllers can work on a single device.  This means two players can go head-to-head on the same screen! The android emulators are already compatible and two player games are on the way for iOS.\nTHIS JUST IN....\nFeedback on this device through our website and Facebook page has been overwhelmingly positive.  People can't wait to get their hands on it.  We are thrilled to announce that our most requested feature is being added to the iMpulse - media control!  \n- We have WORKING PROTOTYPES!\n- We launched the iMpulse website in June and have already and have already captured the attention of over a thousand iMpulse pre-order buyers and followers! Our initial production batch will ship to them before the end of this year.\n- The hardware, circuit design, and industrial design are done and we are already setting up for manufacturing.\n- Our firmware has recently been updated with southpaw support, media control and a unique two player mode.\n- Our first batch of 50 review units will be released Sept 27. \nWe've made it pretty far on our own. The prototypes are fantastic.  You've got to play with an iMpulse to truly appreciate how much better, faster and smoother the experience is.\nWe are actively increasing the pool of supported games, with more and more developers coming forward to add iMpulse support!\nSo - we are still going through rigorous testing and refinements, however there is NO doubt - the iMpulse is everything we'd hoped for, and more.\nPlease visit our website - www.impulsecontroller.com, or join our forum community.impulsecontroller.com. \nThe forum also has a \"Developer\" section where we'll be posting our free SDK and all the information any developer needs to add support for the iMpulse to their games.\nWe're also on twitter (#iMpulseCtrl) and Facebook (www.facebook.com/impulsecontroller).\nProduct Specifications:\nSize: 2.7\"l x 1.3\"w x 0.6\"h.\nBattery: Rechargeable Lithium Polymer.\nBattery Life: 10 hours playtime, 30 days standby.\nBluetooth Version: 2.1 low power protocol\nEffective Range: 100 feet.\nUPDATE #01: (09/21/2012)\nWe just got our Limited Option Metal Finish Cases (Pledge level $45 and $55) from the plating factory, and they're looking fan-tas-tic!

Emulator support!\n\n\nManufacturing: To cover the cost of dies for the plastic enclosure and to pay for the parts that go into making YOUR iMpulse. \nWe will be manufacturing the iMpulse in Southern California, which offers a competitive and productive environment for PCBoard manufacture, component assembly, plastics molding and high quality die-making facilities.\nWe have after all created the iMpulse prototypes using SoCal resources, brains, talent and productivity!\nWith the support we get from Kickstarter, we can pull our local production resources together and provide regional employment. \nSimply - we need to achieve a high level of exposure rapidly so we can reach our minimum order sizes for the iMpulse, and begin manufacturing it.\n\nWe have done something right with the iMpulse - it's a device that many people have been looking for. Here is a product that's cool, convenient, affordable, and is multi-talented. Kickstarter is THE natural fit for a product like the iMpulse.\nTo reach our break-even point we need to manufacture another 4,000 units. While we're confident that we will reach our target one way or the other, the KEY advantage of Kickstarter support and exposure is SPEED. The sooner we achieve our target, the sooner we can roll volume manufacturing, and ship the iMpulse.\nKickstarter also provides:\n- Attention from game developers and software engineers, who can incorporate our SDK and add support for the iMpulse in their games and applications\n- Increased dialog and discussion, which lead to improvements in our product and its successors.\nSo - Bottom Line - we are looking for YOUR support to reach a KS target of $50k. This amount, combined with our total pre-orders, will get us to our minimum order volume.\nWe're a highly motivated team of designers and technologists, who have been lucky enough to pursue our ambitions of designing better products and experiences for people in the digital age. Check out our website to learn more about the exciting projects we've worked on.\nDesigning better quality game content and elegant UIs for apps and sites has brought us to our latest passion - creating accessories that maximize the promise of mobile computing while overcoming its limitations.  \nThe iMpulse is a classic example of our approach. While we think that mobile gaming rocks, and online/downloadable games and content are the cat's whiskers - we really can't embrace the idea of clumsily jabbing at and squeegeeing around our smartphone screen, trying to guess where we're headed and blindly guessing at obstacles. And cars/planes/tanks are meant to be CONTROLLED, not squashed under-thumb! There's a need for controllers, as the market is now realizing - but who wants something huge that either doubles the size of their smartphone, or requires a backpack to carry it around in? \nThis project started a long time ago. Development began using the original iPhone! Our desktop charger/dock/controller was designed and functioning a couple months BEFORE thinkgeek.com announced their \"iCade\" April Fool's joke...\niMpulse's precursor...\nOur prototype desktop model was named \"SpaceDock\", to accentuate the fact that it was a dock/recharger as well as being a perfectly capable controller.\nAt some point however, it struck us that what we REALLY needed to be focusing on was making our controller as small and portable as possible. And also that we needed to think in terms of our device as a general purpose companion product, so additional features (such as the keyfinder and the camera remote) would be essential to its success.\nControl YOUR iMpulse!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Black Friday Bonus from Black Powder!", "update_content": "Hi iMpulsers!\nHope you are all enjoying a great weekend (holiday weekend, for those of you in the U.S. :)\nJust a quick Update to inform you that for this weekend only, you can pick up an iMpulse Controller for yourself or a friend, for a special Black Friday price of $29.99 (plus s/h).

Bursting at the seams with geeky references, random trivia and celebrity cameos, G.E.E.K is a superhero book for the next generation; A love letter to all the things that make the Geeky world go round, and filtered through the mind of Bagged & Boarded's Matt Cohen.\n-------------------\nUPDATE 8/11: ANY donation of $20 or more now gets you a FREE digital copy of G.E.E.K (goes for current donors as well), and any less than $20 gets you a HUGE discount code for a digital copy.\nUPDATE 8/27: Sneak peek at the first 4 pages of rough G.E.E.K art on the bottom of this page!\n-------------------\nBasically: I am about to produce/self distribute a graphic novel that I have written, and while I will take on the cost of manufacturing/printing/distribution, I would like to cover the costs of Art/Artists fees' through crowd-sourcing and Kickstarter. I was lucky enough to hook up with the incredibly talented Axel Ortiz, and while his work is amazing... it don't come cheap :)  100% of the proceeds would go towards paying the artist in full for his work, so the only one profiting from this endeavor would be a hard working artist payed for services rendered. I will also update the page with art as it comes in so the funders see exactly what their contributions are going towards. Basically- This is a chance for the comic book/nerd community to fund a geek's dream and to help promote original stories in a world of reboots and remakes.\nG.E.E.K is not just a comic book, but the launch of a new brand that will ideally span many different mediums and live on in many incarnations over the years. \nIn the coming months, myself, Shawn Depasquale (editor/letterer) and Axel Ortiz (Artist extraordinaire) have many exciting updates/content related to G.E.E.K, ranging from podcasts, to comedy shorts to live shows in the Los Angeles area; by funding G.E.E.K, you not only help bring a graphic novel to life but also an entire universe in which I plan on playing in for a long time to come.\nIf you ever wanted something different... something that spoke to you. If you ever wanted to be on the ground floor of an exciting new project... and hell... if you want to prove that just cause a fucker reads comics, it doesn't mean he can't start some shit...\nG.E.E.K is for you.\n-Matt Cohen \nIt all begins...\nUPDATE 8/27.\nHey kids...

Please join us in showcasing the best of Albania!\nSTORY:  In the splendour of the Northern Mediterranean, I visited my homeland of Albania to discover both the old and the new.  Alongside my brother Nate, photographer and my \"Cheshire Cat\" Fadil Berisha, my boyfriend Rick Fox, actor Blerim Destani, opera singer Inva Mula, dancer Tony Davolani, singer Aurela Gace, footballer Lorik Cana, opera singer Ermonela Jaho, artist Capitol T, and more, we blazed a trail from the capital city Tirana to the sexy beaches of the Albanian Riviera and the rugged villages of the Albanian Alps.  I was also fortunate to experience the hospitality of Albania's leaders: Prime Minister Sali Berisha, President Bamir Topi and Tirana Mayor Lulzim Basha and to hear their messages of hope for a beautiful country.\nI experienced many Albanian customs; eating, dancing, exploring, balling, shopping, sporting, etc.  I got to know the people, politics and economics of a young democracy in an ancient land, as I uncovered the Albania of today.\nIt was eye-opening to discover how Albania lives in me, witnessing the pride of the country and receiving the key to Korce, the city of my family's origin, and my Albanian citizenship. \nI am hoping to reach as many people as possible, so please spread the word!  Faleminderit!
