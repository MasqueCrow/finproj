[{"backer": "Steve Guttbinder", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Moisture-Wicking Patch Absorbs On The Inside Without Showing Through The Outside (Coffee Used As Example)\nHydrophobic Solution Reflects All Water, Oil, and Protein-Based Liquids\nOur Story\nThe idea for a sweat-proof dress shirt first came to David during a transitional point in his life, after his move from New York to Florida. Without being previously accustomed to the heat and humidity of the South, his profuse sweating became a pressing issue that he couldn't seem to resolve. After countless months of trial and error from appointments with dermatologists, to spending hundreds of dollars on expensive shirts, the stains became inevitable. He seemed to sweat through every dress shirt he wore - whether it was walking into work or just simply a nice evening out with some friends. The more frustrated David grew with this problem, the more he realized he wasn't alone.\nWe\u2019ve all experienced it\u2014whether it be the result of climate, anxiety or simply running late\u2014we\u2019ve all perspired through a shirt. It\u2019s a common embarrassment, and one that need not count against us, when appearances matter most.\nWith this idea in hand, David approached his lifetime friend, Jacob Boyer, where the two worked while attending school at the University of Central Florida self-funding this vision and seeking the answer to the sweat issue. \nAnd thus DAVID HYDE APPAREL was created- A clothing line that not only protects it's users from this issue but also does so in a fashionable way. \nThe Product \nDavid Hyde Apparel's performance is the result of two factorial components in each of our products. On the outside of our clothing, we treat a light-weight, luxurious cotton blend with an Eco-friendly Hydrophobic Solution that repels of ALL water, oil, and protein based liquids. This solution is conducted with \"Green-Chemistry\" here in the United States and is not only organic, but PFC & PFOA-Free, passing all issued third-party toxicology testing. We also use a silver alternative in our solution for bacterial breakdown allowing our products to be odor-free. This alternative is not only healthier to the touch, but also clean to the environment.\nThe inside consists of our patent-pending patch design that draws moisture from the body to dry at a 2.5x faster rate than normal cotton. These patches consist of a moisture-wicking fabric that is both breathable as well as elastic for a proficient range of motion. They are then placed along the inner-lining of each of our shirts where you are prone to sweat the most. The usage of double sided fabric not only allows for the outer layer's appearance to remain unaltered, but also allows for the relief of moisture in comparison to similar, reflective products where the moisture sits unpleasantly on the skin throughout the day eventually showing through. \nBecause of our patch design, many ask if weight becomes a factor to our products- and the answer is NO. Through trial and error with over 10 prototypes and 1,000+ fabrics tested, we have successfully found a blend that can both uphold our performance standards as well as deliver a competitive, light-weight feel when worn. Our fabric suppliers are extremely educated on industry trends and strive to remain current with new technology allowing us to quickly adapt/upgrade our products with ease, if necessary.  \nManufacturing\nAll of our products will be made in the Los Angeles' Fashion District at our partner facility. Our manufacturer team has members that have been in the fashion industry for 30+ years who have worked diligently with us on the design ensuring prestigious quality alongside a modern look. They have worked with several reputable brands earning them global exposure and a significant identity in the fashion business. \nPrevious Manufacturer Clients/ Partners\nBackerClub is an exclusive club for people who love Kickstarter and back a ton of projects. BackerClub is featuring our campaign in the Club this week. We're excited about what they are doing and hope you like it too!  \nProud user of http://kickingitforward.org\nSizing & Color\nSizing chart to be released soon via email to all of our backers following our campaign. Here we will coordinate color preference and sizing for each of the products promised in our reward program. We plan to cover sizes S (Limited), M, L, XL, XXL and XXXL (Limited) for our initial launch.  \nFor our first production, we will be offering three colors- Cadet Blue (light Blue), White as well as Mauve (Lavender). Additional colors and patterns will be available when we launch our site following this campaign. \nTimeline\nFAQ\nHow do I choose a color and size for my shirt?\n-Once the Kickstarter is complete, we will contact all donors for color and size selection.\nWhat colors will be offered?\n-Aqua Blue, Lavender, White\nAre the shirts machine washable?\n-We recommend laundering, but the shirts are machine washable. We recommend ironing on low-medium heat, and to NOT use dryer sheets when drying.\nDoes the shirt repel sauces like ketchup and mustard?\n-Our shirt repel all water, oil, and protein based liquids. The shirt will be stained by sauces, but will wash away due to our \"Stain Release\" treatment.\nRefunds/ Exchanges\nDue to this being a \"fundraiser\" for production and development of our company, there will be no refunds issued for any of our pre-order purchased products. However, we will be more than happy to exchange any products received for different sizes or colors to ensure satisfaction with funding our project. For future business we plan for a refund and exchange policy to be implemented to provide consumers with comfortability when shopping David Hyde Apparel. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction: Because of the unique design behind each of our products, the first cycle of production may be longer than future orders as our materials are sourced from several cities within the United States. The size of the first production run is estimated to yield 1,000 dress shirts which will take a month alone in shipment of raw materials as well as treatment of the fabric. Once everything has arrived at our production facility in Los Angeles, assembly of the shirts at the 1,000 ct. could take as long as two months. For transparency purposes, you will receive emails during the whole production process. \n\nProduct Performance: We have thoroughly tested each one of our shirts and deemed them capable of all of the performance factors we market them with. That being said, not only is there always room for improvement but always room for error as well. There may be certain stain scenarios that our shirts fail to overcome or you may sweat in areas that aren't included in our patch design- We get it. Part of our raised capital from our Kickstarter will be solely invested in further R&D for our sweat-proof technology.

Beginning with our Icon Pillow Collection, a decade later that mission remains as we've grown to create pillows and products for all passions. For our 10 year anniversary we wanted to get back to our roots and celebrate the tech community that embraced us and made Throwboy possible. The Iconic Pillow Collection is without question our finest work to date and each can be enjoyed as a cuddly pal, a home decor conversation piece, a collector's item or all of the above.\nManufacturing\nSince 2013, we have worked with the same trustworthy manufacturer that adheres to our high quality standards and delivers our products in the most timely manner. For the Iconic Pillow Collection we will continue to work with this factory to mass produce this special Kickstarter run of pillows.\n\nShipping and Delivery\nAll rewards will ship from our headquarters in Seattle, Washington USA by our team of trained employees and interns. We strive to bring you each reward at the lowest shipping rate available via the United States Postal Service with true rates for shipping and handling. International shipping is available to most countries. \n\n\nAbout Throwboy\nThe Throwboy brand is synonymous with unique, high quality throw pillows made for self expression. Started in 2007 as a one-man pillow factory in Seattle, Washington USA, we became the home decor staple among the internet savvy with our trendy product line and high quality craftsmanship. The idea for Throwboy formed after Roberto Hoyos hand-sewed 7 pillows shaped like computer icons as a gift for his girlfriend. When photos of the pillows went viral online causing Hoyos' website to crash, a business opportunity was born. With a built-in audience, Throwboy took off and went on to define a new kind of throw pillow.\nWe built upon the original idea and continued to introduce more pillows inspired by digital lifestyle including the original Emoji Pillows\u00ae. From there we expanded into multimedia with our Pillow Fighters brand that includes apps, comics, stuffed figures and more. We now collaborate with select top brands for special edition Throwboy pillows and Pillow Fighters, while infusing our signature style into each collection.\nToday, Throwboy is available through our exclusive global distribution partners and through our own online store. The sewing and designing traditions Hoyos' learned from his grandmother remain the foundation of the company as shown in our inspiring and carefully crafted products.\nCredits\nVideo by: Weak Spot - http://weakspot.productions/\nMusic by: Joakim Karud", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere at Throwboy we're committed to making this project happen. We've identified the three major roadblocks that could keep us from our goal and developed a strategy to overcome these obstacles. They are:\n\n- Reward fulfillment problems: We've already identified a team of Throwboy interns and volunteers to work with us in a dedicated space that will be used only to fulfill rewards in a timely manner.\n\n- Trouble identifying a manufacturer: As stated above, we have been working with a trustworthy manufacture for 5 years that has been abiding by our high quality standards and allowed us to import/export thousands of pieces of inventory, including but not limited to our Emoji Pillows line. For the Iconic Pillow Collection we will continue to work with our manufacturer to deliver this premium product.\n\n- An incomplete design: Throwboy pillows start with an idea that\u2019s fleshed out into a full design. Multiple versions of a design are created until a final is chosen. For the Iconic Pillow Collection, Roberto Hoyos has finished a final design and created finalized pillow samples. In other words, the images of the pillows are not artist renderings. All that\u2019s left is the funding to back this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "GOOD KARMA & VIRTUAL HIGH FIVE!", "descp": "Thanks very much.

Allow their hero and favorite storybook character to be a grandpa who started his own shoe shop, or a grandmother who raised six children solo. Your children will grow to appreciate their family story and develop what scholars call an \"intergenerational self\".

We\u2019ve come a long way, but we still have a long way to go. Each of us has made huge sacrifices to get this music to you, and now it\u2019s time to grow together.\nWe\u2019ll be traveling to Omaha at the end of this month to record with Grammy-award winning producer and drummer Robert \u201cSput\u201d Searight (Snarky Puppy, Kendrick Lamar, Kirk Franklin). Why Omaha? Because we want to get out of the city for 7 full days of nothing but music.\nAfter recording, producing, mixing, and mastering the album, we need to promote it. We\u2019ll be working with our friends at Cosign, Kilzone, and Revive to help make An Orchid Is Born our biggest release yet.\nFor the physical album, we\u2019re going to sell it as a wearable, listenable piece of jewelry. Just plug headphones into the orchid and press play. We're also going to print vinyl (finally!).\nAn Orchid Is Born is our most ambitious album yet, and we need all of your help to make it. We didn\u2019t get this far by ourselves and we need you to keep going!\nHere's how we'll be spending the money that you donate:\nStep 1: Recording the album\n$6,150 for studio time at Make Believe Studios (Omaha, NE) from June 27-July 3\n$1,700 for travel to Omaha and lodging\nStep 2: Finishing the album\n$7,000 for production with \"Sput\"\n$1,500 for mixing\n$1,500 for mastering\nStep 3: Digital Design\n$500 for single artwork and new website images\nStep 4: Music Videos\n$1,000 each for 3 music videos\nStep 5: Photography\n$500 for new photos to promote the album\nStep 6: Press and Radio Campaign\n$1,750 with Revive Music\n$1300 with Cosign Media (US Radio)\n$600 with Kilzone (CA radio)\n$825 printing and shipping radio mailers\nStep 7: Merch\n$2,000 for 75 men's shirts, 75 women's shirts and 50 hats ($9.50 ea. for shirts, $11.50 ea. for hats)\nStep 8: The Physical Album\n$2,725 for 1,000 wooden cases and printing\n$1,500 for 1,000 mp3 players\nTOTAL COST: $36,000 ($32,550 +10% credit card and Kickstarter fees)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike our previous albums, we're not even going to think about a release date until after we have the album finished, mixed, and mastered. This will give us enough time to promote it the right way and have a specific release strategy, instead of losing our minds to cut corners trying to meet deadlines. This doesn't mean that you won't see the music until 2020, it just means that we are going to work tirelessly to get this thing right before we put it out. \n\nPressing vinyl can be very expensive and most plants have extremely long wait times. Luckily, we will be working with Shuga Records in Chicago to cover the costs and make the process as smooth as it can be. Nevertheless, it is always possible that vinyl pressing gets pushed back, simply because of supply & demand. \n\nWe have laid out the album's budget in a clear and, most importantly, realistic way. We've made albums for less money, and we know plenty of bands that have made great albums for next-to-nothing. In our case, this is what we need to make An Orchid Is Born the best and most impactful album we've ever made. We have three albums under our belt and by now, we know the expenses and pitfalls of the process.

But what goes into the secret sauce of friendship? Kristen, Cory and James here on the KNOW YOUR HUMANS! team think it's all about being able to express yourself authentically through conversation and play.\nThat\u2019s why we simmered that secret sauce directly into KNOW YOUR HUMANS!, a new party card game for 3 - 10 players, ages 16+.\nIn just a few rounds, strangers become friends, and friends become even closer. Originally inspired by Truth-or-Dare, our game prompts players to interact in three awesome ways:\nQuestion Cards that range from silly hypothetical to thoughtfully personal.\nAction Cards with ridiculous cooperative challenges.\nAnd Battle Cards that will have your friends facing off in competitive mini-games.\nIt's your new secret weapon against boring conversation and forgettable hangouts.\n80% of the cards involve 2 or more players, so you\u2019ll rarely play alone, and no one has to sit on the sidelines for long. You might learn about someone\u2019s supervillain alter ego, invent a secret handshake, or have an epic finger fencing battle!\nKNOW YOUR HUMANS! is perfect for:\nLearning new things about humans you\u2019ve known forever \nBreaking the ice with new humans \nBringing different circles of friends together\n\u2026when you\u2019re hanging out at home, festivals, family gatherings, bachelor/ette parties, on vacation, or any of the other weird places you humans gather.\nBut this ultimate weapon against boring hangouts won\u2019t exist without YOU! So if you\u2019re the kind of person who wants to know how your roommate would survive the zombie apocalypse, and participate in a massively multiplayer thumb war all in the same game, please help us make this dream a reality.\nWith love & pajama parties for all,\nKristen, Cory, & James\nHow To Play\nTo play the game, everyone begins with three random cards in their hand, and one player starts the game off as the \u201cParty Wizard.\u201d Everyone submits one card from their hand that they think the Party Wizard will want to play.\nThe Party Wizard chooses one of the submissions, and plays the prompt on the card, which might be a question, action, or battle. Whoever submitted the chosen card gets 1 point, unless it was a Battle Card. In that case, whoever wins the battle gets 2 points.\nThe Party Wizard then gets to return the cards she or he didn\u2019t choose back into the deck anywhere they like. All players draw a new card from the deck, and the role of Party Wizard shifts to the left. The game ends when one lucky human reaches 3 points.\nOur Story\nOnce upon a time, James, Cory, and I used to socialize by simply sitting on our butts and drinking, like normal humans\u2026 And then we experienced raves, art festivals, and travel adventures with friends. During those experiences, we discovered that the most memorable parts weren\u2019t the DJs or the beautiful destinations. While we do love a good laser light show, the best moments were when we got to bond with our favorite people on a deeper level.\nWe began to understand that it\u2019s possible to design experiences that maximize both fun and meaningful connection. This combination had a powerful impact on our own lives, and we wanted to find ways to share what we had learned with more people.\nOur first idea was to host live events for this purpose. Our big test was a New Year\u2019s party complete with a storytelling \u201ctattoo\u201d parlor, an indoor playground, and even a giant neon squid puppet partying with us on a black light dance floor. We really felt the magic of bringing people closer, but our impact was limited to people who could attend. We wanted that magic to reach many more friend groups beyond our city. So, we took everything we had learned about bonding through play, and baked it into a card game that anyone could experience anywhere.\nEvery day more adults are gathering to connect face-to-face over card and board games. As life long gamers ourselves, we are incredibly inspired to be a part of this global movement. And since we\u2019re driven by connection, we wanted to make a game where no matter who wins, everyone walks away with new memories, inside jokes and appreciation for the humans you played with.\nThrough our experience creating live events, we had learned that there are some key elements in the secret sauce of connection. So, we built KNOW YOUR HUMANS! around two of the most important ones - personal storytelling and play. Now that we\u2019ve got this game, even a night sitting around on our butts drinking can turn into a night we remember forever. We\u2019ve spent the past nine months testing and revising the game, and now we need your help to take it prime time!\nWe Need Your Help!\nObviously, we need your hard earned cash to help us produce the game, but we\u2019re also incredibly excited to see how all you superhero (and supervillain) geniuses out there in the Kickstarter community can help make KNOW YOUR HUMANS! even better. We will have opportunities for you to playtest our current prototype, and weigh in on things such as: \nOptimal number of points for a win \nUpper limit on group size \nBest 2 player remix \nBest non-competitive remix\nAnd of course we\u2019re open to your new card suggestions as well. Let\u2019s make something new and awesome together, ya\u2019ll!\nStretch Goals\nOur current prototype cards come snuggled inside of a ridiculously cute cat or dog travel pouch. The pouch always gets a laugh, and puts people in the mood to play. It\u2019s like a wingman that primes people for fun wherever you take it. Producing custom pouches at scale would be expensive, but if we sell 1,500 copies, everyone will get an awesome carrying case instead of a boring ol\u2019 cardboard box! (Please note: Cards in the photo below are of an older version of the game. All backers will receive the new and improved deck which is bridge-sized and a new animal pouch design that is TBD!)\nFAQ\nHow many players does the game support? The standard rules support 3-10 players, but the game can be remixed to play with different group sizes. We will be asking our community to experiment with different group sizes during our public playtesting phase.\nWhat's the age range for the standard game? We think 16+ is a good suggestion, but there\u2019s no hard language or sexually explicit material in the game.  Our age suggestion is more reflective of the mature nature of our Question Cards - for example, it might be tough for a 10 year old to answer \u201cWhat\u2019s an identity you\u2019ve left behind?\u201d  \nWhat's the age range for the NSFW Booster pack?  The suggested age for the NSFW booster cards is 21+ because they will include drinking games, stronger language and some sexual questions.\nHow long does it take to learn and play? Learning only takes a few minutes, so it\u2019s easy to bust out at a party. Play times vary depending on how many players are involved, but generally range from 15-40 minutes. It can also be played non-competitively for as short or as long as you like. Use it as a 10 minute ice breaker, or stay up playing until dawn - see if we care, we\u2019re not your Dad!\nWhat's included with the game? A 53 card deck of Question, Action, and Battle Cards, an instruction card, and a box made of space age material (cardboard). If we hit our stretch goal, we\u2019ll replace the box with a custom carrying pouch!\nWhere are you printing the cards? Panda Games will be our partner for manufacturing.\nCan I change/update/delete/add to/massage my address/order? Yes. At the end of the campaign, we'll send out a survey asking for a final mailing address plus a detailed description of exactly what you ordered so we can be sure to send you the right swag.\nWhat size are the cards? Our cards are \u201cbridge\u201d size (2.25\"x3.5\"), which are slightly smaller than standard poker cards (2.5\"x3.5\"). The smaller cards travel nicely, and we want you to be able to KNOW YOUR HUMANS! anywhere you wander on Spaceship Earth!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve tested the game with friends (and strangers who then became friends) for nine months before launching this Kickstarter. So we know it\u2019s fun, and we know it helps people get to know each other. One of our cards resulted in the invention of a new hug called \u201cBooty Dreams\u201d that\u2019s been outlawed in 5 states, so I guess that\u2019s a risk.\n\nWe\u2019ve lined up Panda Games as our manufacturer, and ShipWise as our fulfillment partner, so we should be good to go there.

Pre-order Range Dial from us.\n\nMake the most of your time and ingredients.\nCooking can be a joy when you make a delicious meal, a disappointment when you get it wrong, and disaster when you present the charred, leathery wreckage to your hungry friends and family. \nThat's why we created Range Dial \u2014 a precision cooking thermometer that works with or without your smartphone. Range helps you achieve that kitchen joy whether it's grilling, baking, brewing, or candymaking.\nRange Dial is the evolution of our previously Kickstarted thermometer, Range. We've learned a lot from how our customers use Range, and added the top requests: Bluetooth for wireless monitoring, and a second probe for ambient temperature. But we also thought carefully about the friction points and how we could address them.\nRange Dial works with or without a smartphone. Having a connected device shouldn't mean you have to mess with an app for the most basic functions. Just plug in the probe and turn the dial to a preset\u2014Range Dial will beep at you, and you'll also get a push notification on your phone when your food is done. Or open the app to have full control. It's the best of both worlds.\nWe paid attention to the details. Range Dial is extremely precise thanks to our custom engineered temperature-measuring circuit and probes. It's built to last with machined stainless steel, silicone and polycarbonate. We didn't even take the temperature probe for granted, carving useful features into it.\nA history\nHi, I'm John. For years I've been obsessed with integrating new interfaces and connectivity into everyday objects. At the MIT Media Lab, I built a series of objects that get past the idea that you have to pull out a screen and poke at it to perform basic tasks. That's not the future\u2014that's a step backward.\nI also love cooking for my family and experimenting in the kitchen, though I'm no expert. With our original Range cooking thermometer, I got better results and did less hovering over the stove and grill.\nThousands of you chefs using Range, professionals and enthusiasts, taught us what we could continue improving. You want a Bluetooth tool that does what it's told with minimal futzing. We listened.\nTinker with your recipes, not with an app. Range Dial can do things no other thermometer can, and yet we've designed it around a physical dial so you don't have to use your phone.\nI'm excited to build a great cooking tool for all of us to use. So, let's tear our bloodshot eyes off our screens (after you're done reading this page and pledging) and savor the sights, smells and tastes of life!\nWhat you can do with Range Dial\nCook a juicy turkey while prepping the sides (throw away that horribly inaccurate pop-up thermometer)\nSmoke tender brisket overnight while watching your ambient temperature\nRepeatable and recordable homebrew recipes\nLearn about the sugar stages and how temperature stalls \nMake your own yogurt and cheese \nCorrect for your inaccurate oven (have you checked? It's bad.)\nSous vide soft-cooked egg \nExperiment with variations and collect data on your recipes\nWhat our backers and customers are already doing with the first Range:\nVersatility, now and in the future\nWe've engineered probes for Range Dial to meet any job:\nRange Dial has two probe ports. This makes it possible to watch two dishes at once, or get a second reading for ambient temperature (critical for smoking or precise oven roasting). And it means that your Range Dial will be versatile, taking advantage of new and improved cooking sensors. \nFor the technically inclined, Range Dial will work with our existing SDK so you can add temperature to any app, and allow you to replace the firmware with an Arduino one so you can build your own sensors and control systems. We can't wait to share the ideas we have planned, and to hear your ideas, too.\nSupport for iOS and plans for Android\nCurrently, Range Dial will work with your iPhone or iPad running iOS 8 or newer. Your device needs to support Bluetooth Low Energy to connect directly (which means iPhone 4S, iPad 3 or newer), but you can monitor remotely with older devices.\nWe want to support Android as well, and will be able to start working on an app that's up to our standards if we raise over $180,000. Even if we don't, an Android app will be made eventually. A pledge for Range Dial is your vote for Android support\u2014you can always cancel your pledge before the end of the campaign if we don't reach that goal.\nWhat makes Range Dial better?\nMore precise temperature measurement. It's easy (for an engineer) to measure temperature. But it takes time and passion to design a circuit that measures temperature really, really accurately, and most thermometers don't try that hard. We did because if you're going to get repeatable results, you need to have precise measurements.\nWorks without a smartphone. Turn Range Dial to one of the four presets. It'll beep when your food is done. (And yes, you can change what those presets are through the app.)\nBetter Bluetooth range. Bluetooth devices often have a disappointing connection in the real world. This is usually because they use a cheap trace antenna and turn the Bluetooth radio power down to save battery life. We do neither: Range Dial uses a ceramic chip antenna and crams in two AAA batteries, so we can get great range out of Bluetooth, and still have superior battery life.\nInfinite range. When we say you can disconnect, we mean it. As long as you have one device connected to Range Dial via Bluetooth, you can monitor your temperatures from any device connected to the Internet.\nExpandability. Each Range Dial has two ports to plug in sensors. This lets you monitor ambient temperature (critical for smoking or precise roasting and baking) or just a second dish. And it means that your Range Dial will be versatile, taking advantage of new and improved cooking sensors we develop in the future.\nTop-notch materials and components. We're building a tool to last, so we made it out of stainless steel, polycarbonate and silicone.\nThird-party apps. The Range app was designed to be straightforward for a range of needs, but you may want software tuned for your particular culinary specialty. Range is supported by Roastmaster for coffee roasting, iBrewMaster for homebrewing beer, and has a free SDK that any app can use to add support for temperature.\nApp\nFor iPhone and iPad running iOS 8 or newer\nRead temperatures on a device connected by Bluetooth Low Energy\nRead temperatures remotely on other devices via the Internet (no one else does this)\nSet alerts for rising, falling, or temperature ranges with a swipe\nF and C, USDA and gourmet presets\nDone-time prediction \nGraphing with CSV data export\nChange dial presets to whatever suits you\nSpecifications\nReads temperatures from -40\u00baF to 450\u00baF (-40\u00baC to 230\u00baC)\nAccurate to 0.9\u00b0F at 150\u00baF (0.5\u00baC at 65\u00baC)\nBluetooth Low Energy (requires iPhone 4S, iPad 3, or newer)\n2xAAA, 6 months battery life\nStainless steel, silicone, polycarbonate\nTwo multipurpose sensor ports\nRewards\nNote that we may tweak finishes and colors a bit heading into production, but all with the aim of making this thing great.\nWhy we need your help\nWe've spent our own time and money so far on industrial design, engineering, sourcing components and lining up suppliers. To go into production, we need to polish off development, pay for tooling, and get a minimum quantity commitment. Quality doesn't come cheap.\nWe used our experience and deliberate engineering to get the cost down. We owe a lot to our community on Kickstarter for backing us before, and so you get a great price before Range Dial gets released to the rest of the world.\nKickstarter is also amazing for the conversations we can have with backers. When you back us, you won't just enable us to make Range Dial\u2014as our first and most enthusiastic customers, you'll have the opportunity to shape it as we make some final decisions.\nIf you're an existing Range owner, this Kickstarter benefits you, too. It'll allow us to continue bringing new features to the Range app.\nSchedule\nWe've done a lot of work so far, and we've padded the schedule for the inevitable mistakes that come when you're trying to work with factories to produce a complex product at scale. If delays do occur, we'll be upfront about what's going on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou're a Kickstarter backer \u2014 you know that making physical products is hard, and seen the horror stories.

Want the nitty gritty details? Here you go:\n LIFE, AFTER is a web series by Corinne Caputo and Erica Tachoir.\nThe show follows two best friends (Corinne and Erica) who are hit by a bus, die, and become ghosts. Together, they navigate the strange rules of the afterlife while trying to figure out their unfinished business so that they can \"pass on.\"\nCorinne and Erica learn the hard way that ghosts can pass through walls but not glass. They accidentally haunt an old friend. A new \"roommate\" moves into their once beloved apartment. They try bringing Erica's former crush to a pottery wheel to reenact the scene from the movie Ghost. They meet other ghosts and find even more uncertainty about what the afterlife means. Perhaps there is no such thing as unfinished business at all...\nThough it has dark moments (It is a show about death...), Life, After is ultimately a fun and light-hearted exploration of friendship. How does Erica and Corinne's friendship survive when time is infinite and responsibilities are absent? How do they navigate the uncertainty? How can they find a way to change their outfits?\nOnce we are funded, we plan to shoot Life, After this summer, targeting an online release for the fall.\nThe first season of Life, After will be ten episodes, all around three minutes. We want to keep the show short, engaging, and easy for online viewing. They will be released all at once (~Netflix style~), with the pilot episode coming out a week in advance, to allow people to view it at their own pace.\nWe intend to do everything we can to publicize the series and seek a larger platform for future seasons.\n$21,600. It is lot of money. We get that. We also realize it might be hard to imagine where that money is going. Here's a rough overview of the budget to give you a sense of how the money will be spent:\nEquipment and Transportation // $5,650 // Camera rentals, lighting, grip and electric... it takes a lot of gear to make videos! We're getting some great deals by using personal gear and equipment at reduced rental costs, but there's still a lot that we need to achieve the awesome production quality we want. Also, we need to be able to move all that stuff, from Point A to Point B, which means renting vans and paying for secure parking.\nPeople // $4,575 // The key creative folks listed above have all graciously agreed to donate their time to this project. But we still need to pay the rest of our crew members because they are talented professionals (all of whom will be working below their normal rates). Also, regardless of pay, they all need to eat during long production days! We've included our food budget in this number as well.\nLocations and Production Design // $3,275 // Ghosts party in a haunted hotel. Erica stages a seduction in a pottery studio. Corinne and Erica get hit by a bus. These scenes are going to require some specific location needs, and we need money to gain access to those awesome spaces. We also need to make our locations and the people in them look awesome and true to our ghost world.\nPost Production // $5,000 // So often forgotten and neglected, post-production is really where the project comes together, and there's a lot that has to happen after the shooting wraps. Beyond the main picture edit, there's the sound design, the visual effects to create our ghostly appearances, music, and more!\nInsurance // $1,500 // What if something breaks? What if someone gets hurt? Hopefully, our shoot will go smoothly without any major issues, but all sorts of things can happen on a set, and it's important for us to be covered and prepared for those situations.\nOther // $1,600 // This covers everything from the fee Kickstarter takes to actually delivering on our rewards, as well as any other unplanned expenses.\nYou may be wondering why we decided to make Life, After as a web series. We firmly believe that the media landscape is shifting in favor of streaming platforms. We love high quality episodic content, and so many of our favorite shows are now viewed online. A successful web series has the potential to reach a much larger audience than we previously would have found at film festivals and more traditional platforms for independent creators. We want to be a part of this exciting new stage in entertainment.\nWe believe in the quality of the content we are creating with Life, After, and we think the time is ripe for this funny, earnest, female-driven comedy, and we believe it can find its best audience online.\nCORINNE CAPUTO // co-creator and lead actor // Corinne is the author of How to Success: A Writer's Guide to Fame and Fortune, which will be published by Chronicle Books in Spring 2016. She has written for Refinery29, HelloGiggles, Bustle, and other sites. She studied improv and sketch comedy at the Upright Citizens Brigade and performs regularly in the monthly HelloGiggles show at the UCB Theater. Every year when blowing out her birthday candles, Corinne wishes to never see a ghost. www.corinnecaputo.com\nERICA TACHOIR // co-creator and lead actor // Erica is a graduate of the film department at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Her short film, \"Too Sunny for Santa,\" screened at festivals around the country and won some awards, too. She also studied at Atlantic Theater Company's acting school and at the Upright Citizens Brigade, where she and Corinne met. She has appeared in national commercials and in projects that have screened at film festivals and on the world's biggest stage: the internet. Erica swears she saw a ghost at night as a child, and she gasped so hard that she woke her parents. www.ericatachoir.com\nPAUL PENCZNER // director // A graduate of NYU\u2019s film program, Paul is a director at the Brooklyn based production company, Buffalo Picture House (www.buffalopicturehouse.com). He\u2019s worked in the editorial department for features, short films and documentaries. As a director he has worked on commercials, short films, sketch videos, and educational projects. He also happens to be dating Erica. As a seven year old, Paul would not go into his family\u2019s basement because he thought the ghost of Adolf Hitler lived there (He lived in Memphis).\nTESSA TREANOR // producer // Tessa, a graduate of NYU/Tisch Film, has produced web content and short branded videos for clients such as 360i, A+E Digital Studios and Funny or Die as well as award-winning short and feature length films. She also produces for the popular comedy web series SRSLY (2014 Webby Awards Honoree). Tessa has never seen is a ghost, which is surprising since she is from England where everything is very old. www.tessatreanor.com\nMATTHEW TROY // cinematographer // Matthew has worked as a cinematographer for a variety of film, TV, and web productions from as far away as New Jersey, where he shot the feature film Chasing Yesterday, to the even farther away destination of the Czech Republic. An alum of NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, where he received faculty commendations for his work behind the camera (and where he and Erica started collaborating in their freshman year), Matthew combines his volunteer firefighter/EMT and filmmaking skills to teach safety to current NYU students. As of this writing Matthew has never seen a ghost, but he has seen Ghost.\nOUR CAST will be composed of talented comedic actors who have appeared on the UCB stage, Broad City, and High Maintenance, and in videos for IFC, Above Average and College Humor.\nThank you for taking the time to check out our project.

You can follow Sam & Mattie's epic filmmaking journey -- starting right now -- on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/samandmattie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/samandmattie\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/samandmattie\nNow, if you'll excuse us, we need to go make the most epic teen zombie movie of all time. \n<3 & BRAINS & DEEP GRATITUDE,\n- SAM, MATTIE, & TEAM ZOMBIE\nWHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?\nHelp Sam and Mattie create their Teen Zombie Movie, exactly as they envision it. \nMake a documentary about the process, from initial scriptwriting through the premier, and beyond. \nTwo movies, one Kickstarter!\nWHO ARE SAM AND MATTIE?\nSam & Mattie are teenagers from Rhode Island. They are BEST friends. They met at Special Olympics while they were in grade school and have been pretty much inseparable since. \nFor the most part, they're normal teenage dudes. They like to skate and play video games and talk about girls and stuff, but the one thing they both LOVE is cinema. They love to go to the movies, talk about movies, brainstorm movie ideas, and act out their favorite scenes.\nThree years ago, they started brainstorming their own Teen Zombie Movie (a favorite genre). This was nothing out of the ordinary -- they are constantly hatching zany schemes to \"launch their careers.\" But something about this zombie movie has stuck with them. For three years. Honestly, they won't shut up about it. \nEvery time they get together, they draw up storyboards, practice fight scenes, film with their iPhones (then pair those scenes with dream soundtracks), and endlessly debate celebrity cameos.  They have been so passionate about this film for so long, that their friends and family decided it was time to help them make it happen FOR REAL. \nWHO IS RUNNING THIS KICKSTARTER?\nThis campaign was launched by a big group of Sam & Mattie's friends, loosely organized by Sam\u2019s older brother Jesse (who is writing what you're reading now. Hi!). What we all have in common is this: we love Sam & Mattie, we think they are the coolest two dudes in the world, and we're all pretty sure their movie is gonna blow you away. \nIf you wanna know more about our creds, check out the \"meet the team\" section below.\nTELL ME ABOUT THE PLOT OF THIS \"TEEN ZOMBIE MOVIE.\"\nWe think some sample scenes (straight outta Sam & Mattie\u2019s original Storyboards, pictured below) will speak for themselves:\nPolice skateboard chase\n\u201cBeing cool in high school\u201d montage\nZombie Prom Ambush\nSelfies / sexting on jetpacks\nShirtless workout montage\n\u201cBeing cool in college\u201d montage\nHotel party with hot girlfriends\nBuying drugs in the city\nTWO separate arrest scenes\nPrison workout montage\nZombie yacht battle\nYacht party with DJ Pauly D (100% unconfirmed)\n...so as you can see, this teen zombie movie is pretty much guaranteed to be awesome. Right now it's clocking in as a 15 - 20 minute short, but that might change during script development. \nSOUNDS... A LITTLE WILD. WILL IT BE PG-13?\nSam and Mattie are pretty wild dudes, and yes, they do have some racy ideas. We will TRY to keep this thing PG-13, but they have final creative say... so no guarantees.\nCAN YOU REALLY PULL THIS OFF?\nHell yes. Sam\u2019s brother and his pals have rallied a team of brilliant filmmaker types. We already have DPs, directors, editors, line producers, graphics people, a sound guy, and more -- and everyone's super excited to get started!  \nMEET THE TEAM (SO FAR):\nBobby Carnevale (Zombie Film Director / Director of Photography) http://www.robertcarnevale.com/\nTim Forster (Documentary Director / Editor) - http://timfo.info/\nSuzy Beck (Producer) http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2684688/\nOther friends who have helped so far include (but are not limited to): Chuck Westcott & Emilie Holland, Julia Ries, Brian Ries, Ina Burke, Eric Tao, The Prefab Messiahs (thanks for the awesome song!), Debi Hammack (thanks for the awesome illustrations!), Chris Suchmann & Mary Pendergast (Sam's Parents), Eric and Carol Zufelt (Mattie's Parents), Dan Neibles for martial arts training, and many more people I am definitely forgetting (sorry!).\nWe have the team, now we just need some funding to officially book the crew and rent the equipment.\nDO YOU HAVE A SOLID PLAN?\nSuzy Beck, our talented producer and long time friend of Sam\u2019s, has put together a budget, crew list, and detailed schedule for a 7-day zombie shoot in Providence, RI. Bobby Carnevale has agreed to direct and coordinate everything zombie related.\nTim Forster has signed on to direct the documentary and edit everything. He will assemble his crew based on the zombie dates and locations, though the doc team will likely be filming long before and after the 7 day shoot.\nPost production will probably happen in NYC, as many of us live / work here. So yes, we're pretty sure we know what we need to do.\nOK, IF I SUPPORT YOU GUYS, WHERE EXACTLY WILL MY MONEY GO? 50K IS A LOT.\nWe're making two movies at the same time, but our goal is to spend the majority of our budget on the zombie movie. It will probably be a short -- less than 20 minutes -- but Sam and Mattie watch tons of hollywood blockbusters, and they have extremely high-budget aspirations. Their vision DEMANDS explosions, jetpacks, blood, swords, disco balls, famous DJ\u2019s, props, zombie make-up, music, special effects, and (obviously) an insane wrap party... all of which are very, very expensive. \nThen, of course, there's creation/distribution of the amazing Kickstarter rewards we're offering in the sidebar (hint, hint) ------->\nAfter covering those costs, we will use the remainder of our budget to fund a documentary crew to capture the magic of their creative process (it really is magic, trust us) and to follow their journey for as long as possible.\nWHY SHOULD I DONATE? CAN\u2019T I JUST SEE THE MOVIE FOR FREE WHEN IT\u2019S DONE?\nWe will eventually release the zombie short online, but it might never happen at all (definitely not the documentary) if this campaign doesn\u2019t succeed. Supporting this Kickstarter makes you an integral part of the film's creation! \nBacking us also offers you a behind the scenes look at Sam and Mattie\u2019s creative process via the production diary, which will be a wild ride, we promise.\nYou're not just backing a simple movie here. You're backing:\nFriendship \nSam and Mattie's careers\nThe greatest Teen Zombie Movie ever made\nHappiness\nThe fulfillment of teenage dreams\nThe RI film industry\nA documentary with the potential to inspire every single person on planet earth \nProof that anything is possible\nA delicious burger buffet\nLastly, it's pretty safe to assume this will be a cult classic, so you're also basically buying bragging rights for life.\nMAYYYYBEEE. I\u2019M STILL ON THE FENCE. ARE THERE COOL REWARDS?\nDuh. Of course Sam and Mattie brainstormed awesome stuff for you (check out footage from the brainstorm below). Some of the ideas didn't make the final cut for budget and/or legal and/or weirdness reasons, but hopefully one of them will catch your eye!\nPLAY\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading! Even if you can't back us financially, you can help us by sharing this page on facebook or twitter! \n\"You guys are our fans. Without you guys i'd just be a pretty face in high school. And Mattie would just be a cool guy who wants to be a DJ.\" -Sam\nThanks for your time!\n- Sam, Mattie, & friends", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a team of highly experienced filmmakers. \n\nIf this campaign is successful we will have the budget.\n\nThat said, Sam and Mattie are in charge of this operation, and this is their first film... so there might be delays, script changes, total rewrites... anything is possible! We all need to stay flexible, because it's all about following their creative vision!\n\nWhat we promise is this: we will capture all the twists and turns, and share them with you along the way. If all goes according to plan, the journey will be almost as awesome as the zombie movie itself.

Mass confusion was the status quo.\nIn 1970, the Standards Manual changed everything.\nIn 1967 the New York City Transit Authority hired Massimo Vignelli and Bob Noorda of the design firm Unimark International to design a signage and wayfinding system that would solve the problem underground.\nThe work they delivered, the 1970 New York City Transit Authority Graphic Standards Manual, succeeded in that goal and, perhaps unintentionally, the Standards Manual became one of the world\u2019s classic examples of modern design.\n\u201cThe Standards Manual looks like arcana, and in many ways it is. But it is also an artifact from a really important moment in the history of New York: the point when the city began to realize it couldn\u2019t just take the subway system for granted and focus all its attention on highways and car culture. The enlightenment didn\u2019t come right away\u2014in the 1970s, many things about the subway got worse before they got better\u2014and signs were a small part of that rebirth, but they were a highly visible one.\"\n\u2014Christopher Bonanos, New York magazine.\nIn 2012\u201442 years after the Standards Manual was released\u2014we discovered a rare copy in the basement of design firm Pentagram. \nNow, under an agreement with the MTA, we are scanning and printing every page in a full-size hardcover book.\nAfter this campaign, this reissue will never become available again.\nSample spreads from the reissue.\nFull specifications of the reissue.\nPrinted in Italy.\n364 pages with 176 four-color plates.\nPlates printed from high-resolution scans of the original Standards Manual.\n12 page introduction and essay (1 color).\n13.5\u201d W \u00d7 13.5\" H (343 x 343 mm).\nHardcover with Cialux cloth wrap and foil stamped title on the cover and spine. \nSmyth (section) sewn binding.\n3 gate folds.\nPrinted on 100 and 140 gsm Munken Pure ivory offset paper.\nWhite head and tail bands.\nEnhanced specs now included thanks you your support:\n9 PMS spot colors for the color pages 46-54 in the original.\nStochastic printing.\nHand sewn binding.\n(See update #5 for more details on these enhanced specs).\nThe book is huge.\n\nIt measures 13.5\" (343mm) square and weighs over 7lbs (3.2kg).\n\nSection 1 of reissue: Introduction and essay.\nIntroduction by Michael Bierut.\nMichael Bierut is a Partner at the international design consultancy Pentagram. Prior to joining Pentagram in 1990 in the firm's New York office, he worked for ten years under Massimo Vignelli at Vignelli Associates, ultimately as vice president of graphic design.\nMichael Bierut is a senior design critic at the Yale School of Art, co-editor of the anthology series Looking Closer: Critical Writings on Graphic Design, published by Allworth Press, and in 1998 he co-edited and designed the monograph Tibor Kalman: Perverse Optimist. He is a co-founder of the weblog Design Observer and his commentaries about graphic design in everyday life can be heard nationally on the Public Radio International program \"Studio 360.\" His book Seventy-nine Short Essays on Design was published by Princeton Architectural Press in 2007.\nEssay by Christopher Bonanos.\nChris Bonanos is a staff writer at New York magazine and is the author of Instant: The Story of Polaroid.\nChris will be writing a 5000+ word essay on the history of the Standards Manual, including illustrations, interviews with people who worked on the successions to the Standards Manual, and MTA staff. \nSection 2: the Standards Manual reproduction.\nEach page of the original Standards Manual will be scanned and be offset printed in four colors. \nEvery page will be included, printed only on the right hand page of the book\u2014consistent with the ring-binder format of the original Standards Manual.\nThe following images are crops from the trial scans we have conducted. Beyond basic curves adjustments for consistency, the pages will not be altered in any way.\nSome pages include notes from unknown users of the Manual.\nWhy is the Standards Manual worth saving?\nEvery single day, millions of New Yorkers rely on the subway to get around the city, and you can't use the subway without encountering the signage designed by Unimark. Over the years many changes have taken place (such as the switch from Standard Medium to Helvetica), but it is a testament to the quality of the work that, 44 years later, the signage holds up.\nAnd perhaps on a deeper level, the signage has given the subway a voice. When a lot of people think of New York City, these signs pop into their head. We feel a tremendous responsibility to publish not only an important piece of design history, but an important part of New York City's history.\n\nA copy of the manual on display in New York's MoMA.\n\n\nWhat are the differences between the original and the reissue?\nThe original Standards Manual is held in a 5 ring binder. Each page inside the binder measures 13x13\".\nThe reissue will be Smyth (section) sewn rather than ring bound. Each page will measure 13.5\"(343 mm) square, so we can include a 0.25\"(6.4mm) border around each scan to ensure we can print the full 13\" scan.\nThe original Manual showing ring-binding.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nAfter we discovered the Standards Manual and created the website thestandardsmanual.com, we sent it to a few friends and colleagues who we thought would enjoy it. \nWithin 72 hours, the website was a viral hit with a quarter of a million unique views. But seeing the Standards Manual on screen didn't do it justice. We realized that the only way to truly experience the Standards Manual was full-size in print. We thought there was no better way to share this piece of design history with you than on Kickstarter.\nIndependently producing the book on Kickstarter allows us to control the production of the book closely, distribute it faster, and keep the cost lower. \nPartnership with MTA and Goal.\nWe have been granted permission by the MTA to reissue the Standards Manual. The copyright to the publication is owned by NYCTA and MTA.\nIf we are successfully funded, we will be donating 36 copies of the Manual reissue to the New York Transit Museum for storage and preservation.\nQuality.\nAs graphic designers who have produced books ourselves, we appreciate high-quality publishing and know what it takes to produce a high-quality art book.\nThe book will be printed in Vicenza, Italy.  \n\nStandard Medium font design.\nThe reissue cover, introduction, and essay headings will be set in a custom version of Standard Medium by type designer Nick Sherman. \nNick painstakingly recreated the font from the photographs we posted on thestandardsmanual.com and has allowed us to use it in the reissue.\nWe are not altering the scans of the original Standards Manual in any way. We are only typesetting the cover, introduction, and essay in Nick's version of the font.\nNYCTA Standard Medium by Nick Sherman.\nThe typeface is based specifically on the glyph designs and spacing system presented in the Standards Manual.\nProject Credits\nCreators\nJesse Reed, jessereedfromohio.com\nHamish Smyth, hamishsmyth.com\n\nCampaign management\nCrowdsourceress Alex Daly and Vann Alexandra, vannalexandra.com\n\nVideo\nHarrison Boyce, harrisonboyce.com\n\nMusic\nEdo Van Breemen, edovanbreemen.com\n\nSpecial thanks\nMichael Bierut, Chuck Gordanier, Chris Bonanos, Nick Sherman, Michelle Laird, Sarah Meister, Joe Marianek, Niko Skourtis, Britt Cobb. \n\nThank you for reading.

After scanning each of the pages (which is no small task\u2014we're anticipating it to take 15\u201320 hours) we will layout the book with InDesign. \n\nFrom there we move to production, where our biggest risks could potentially exist. \n\nHowever, having designed and produced many books ourselves, we understand the process well and have already been working closely with printers to iron out any problems they anticipate before production.\n\nWe will be reviewing hard copy proofs of every page before printing. When the book is being printed, we will be visiting the printing plant to conduct a press check to ensure the color reproduction is faithful to the original.\n\nThis is a big book that is going to take time to print, bind, and finish. We plan on working closely with our printer to ensure the smoothest production possible and, if funded, we plan on updating backers regularly on each step of the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "New project: 1977 EPA Graphic Standards System reissue", "update_content": "Hey NYCTA Backers,\nThis week, we launched a Kickstarter campaign to reissue the 1977 EPA Graphic Standards System reissue, designed by partners Ivan Chermayeff, Tom Geismar, and Steff Geissbuhler of the legendary design firm Chermayeff & Geismar.\nIf successful, a portion of the campaign's proceeds will go to Earthjustice\u2014lawyers fighting for the environment\u2014and AIGA\u2019s Design Archives.\nThe campaign is off to a great start\u2013\u2013We\u2019re 54% towards our goal in just the fourth day.

A glorious volume to preserve an artefact that, after more than 30 years has become legendary among designers. That's why it was produced as an handsome hardcover volume, and that's why the same quality should've been extended to the paper choice. I have nothing against being faithful to the original, quite the contrary as a matter of fact. But if you want to be faithful, be properly faithful and do an exact reproduction of the original.

You'll naturally sit up straighter, hunch less, and it's a lot more comfortable through the day. \nIf you've looked for a stand, you may have felt our frustration - cheap construction, distracting aesthetics, and they take up a lot of desk space.\nSo we designed our own. Strong unibody construction, seamless design, precision CNC milled, beautiful finish, hidden storage, ultra-secure, minimal, smallest footprint, gorgeous on a desk.\nSeamless. We'll use a 90 million pound press, one of the biggest in North America, to extrude its profile. Tesla uses it to make structures for the Model S.\nSmallest footprint. Elevation Stand takes up less space than any other stand.\nMinimal. No screws or parting lines. It's thick-walled and continuous.\nHides desk clutter. Store your hard drive, USB hub, cables, Field Notes, etc. - out of view with easy access. A chamfered hole in the back lets you run cords straight through.\nMore comfortable. With Elevation Stand raising your monitor 66mm, you'll naturally sit up straighter, shoulders back, and lean over less.\nMade the hard way.  Elevation Stand is made with the same expensive processes Apple uses to make their monitor legs. And they look perfect together. \nGorgeous 20-step finish. Every stand will get glass bead blasted, acid etched, electro-chemically polished, and deep anodized. It's the same finish we apply to Elevation Dock and Apple puts on Macbook Pros.\nExtra Secure. Using our NanoPad\u2122 material, Elevation Stand locks to your monitor with thousands of microscopic air vacuums. It's strong enough to prevent your Mac from getting knocked off, yet easy to peel off.\nPerfect next to a raised laptop.  It's more ergonomic and it brings the base of the screens to the same level. \nExcellent with iMac. They were designed for each other.\nGreat for standing desks. Stand tall - no compensating with a high typing height or bending your neck down. \nMatteBlack finish. A subtle, stealth finish that will reflect little light. Its deeply bead-blasted with a mil-spec finish and looks very cool with monitor on top.\nSpecial Edition Red. Put some fire under your Mac with this Limited Edition finish. Its beautifully textured and bright color anodized. Looks really beautiful paired with a Mac.\nCraftsmanship. This video can give you a taste of the care we put into manufacturing our last project Elevation Dock for iPhone. Made by us in Portland & shipped around the world.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAnd a little bonus: Let's end headphone clutter.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIntroducing Elevation Anchor. Keep your headphones out of sight & easy to reach. You'll get two when you back the project. It's made of solid medical-grade silicone, so it won't hurt if you bump it with your knee and will flex before you can knocked it off. Mounts anywhere under your desk with the same 3M adhesive GoPro uses. Great for hiding your headphones in the living room too. (Watch the super short vid below.)\nProduction Schedule. In June, we'll start building Elevation Stand's 4-part steel extrusion tooling, make fixtures for machining, build custom titanium racks for anodizing, and order tooling for the feet. July, we will extrude the aluminum, begin CNC machining, and order packaging. August, we will continue machining and begin the finishing processes of glass bead blasting, anodizing, and lasering. In August we will start QC and final assembly at our shop in Portland. And start shipping in September.\nSo that's ElevationStand: Apple-level quality, design that gets out of the way, and an investment in your posture. \nThank you. Thanks for taking the time to look at our project & appreciate your support. This will exist because of you.\n-Casey & ElevationLab Team\n--------\nHigh-res images download - here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll steps of manufacturing Elevation Stand are within a 10 mile radius of our shop in Portland, OR - this helps resolve manufacturing issues quickly and keep a high level of quality.\n\nThe two main variables affecting shipping time are building the big steel extrusion tooling and scaling up our 20-step finishing process. We mass scaled our US manufacturing with our last project, ElevationDock, and have good people and processes in place to manage it.

So we paused the production, are inspecting each one, and sanding any that need it. They will then get re-blasted, anodized, and lasered. This means our shipping is out about three weeks.

They all said the same thing: \"Our customers don\u2019t care about domestically produced products.\" We call bullsh*t, but we need your help to prove them wrong.\n Let's give American Manufacturing its own yellow ribbon... a wearable way to show your support for the war they're fighting daily.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Bluelace itself: We asked one of America's very last shoelace manufacturers to produce the very best shoelace they'd ever made. \nAdding extra pressure to the pot, we promised them that if they could develop something truly impressive, it had the potential to become more than just a simple shoelace; it could become a symbol! \nAnd this symbol could do more than just help their business, it could help break the ongoing cycle of outsourcing, offshoring, and making things cheaper, faster and worse. It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story? Send us an email with your story idea(s) and if it's a story that fits the bill (and we have the # of backers to do it! ) we'll send our high-end video production team around the country to capture the best of best. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur 10-Year Hoodie project taught us that making a great product in a bunch of colors and sizes can get pretty complicated. We've fulfilled nearly 100% the orders placed. More importantly, when it's all said and done, every single order to every single backer will have been shipped in the AUG - NOV timeframe that we promised.\n\nStill, we learned a lot...\n\nTHE BLUELACE PROJECT centers on one product in one color. \n\nWe don't anticipate any major obstacles for The Bluelace but we can say that should challenges arise, we will manage them efficiently and with you in mind. Still, we'd like to think that the backers invested in seeing this idea succeed, people who believe that it's high time AMERICAN MANUFACTURING GOT ITS OWN YELLOW RIBBON, will be less focussed on the product itself than what it represents and the message it sends.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "A smarter way of doing things; Here at last!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "99% GOOD NEWS - 1% Hiccup", "update_content": "Wow.

Check out our examples:\nDesign\nSmart Icons\nResponsiveness\nIcon Styling\nIcon Toolkit\nWhether you know it or not, you've probably seen Iconic. It's in use on thousands of websites, many of which you likely use everyday. We want to make Iconic even better by increasing the number of beautifully designed icons in the set as well as applying forward-thinking approaches to how icons are built, used and displayed. \nIconic is much more than just icons. We want to take as many of the best current ideas around iconography on the web, along with a few new ideas of our own and encapsulate it into an integrated icon system. Here's a laundry-list of what we'd like to do:\n200+ beautiful icons\u2014each designed at three individual sizes\nThe collection comes in PNG, SVG, WebP and font formats.\nA subset of icons which respond/adjust to data\u2014we call these Smart Icons.\nWell-structured semantic SVG; allowing you to easily style and adjust your icons similarly to how you'd adjust HTML. \nWith Iconic's three-sizes, it allows you to show the right sized icon for the right screen size. We refer to this as Responsive Iconography.\nA full toolkit for production, customization and modification of your icons.\nA comprehensive set of documentation covering all the concepts and tools provided.\nAll this for one simple price.\nThat's a lot to take in, so let's dig in to the details.\nThree individually designed sizes for each icon\nJust because an image is scalable doesn't mean it's legible at all sizes. Most visual elements have a sweet spot in terms of legibility\u2014icons are no different in this regard. To achieve a significantly greater range of legibility, each icon will be designed with different amounts of detail to look great for three different size ranges: small, medium and large.\nNew approaches to icon display\nWe want Iconic to act as a catalyst for new display techniques on the web. A big part of this project will be creating and providing the tools and techniques to support this.\nHere are some of the ideas and techniques we've been exploring for development:\nSmart icons\nThe SVG format gives icons the freedom to extend well beyond the static imagery we currently expect. A subset of Iconic icons will be created with semantic elements and simple API hooks allowing for dynamic control of the icons and its elements.\nResponsive iconography\nDifferent screen dimensions often place unique requirements on a visual design. But screen size isn't the only attribute that has an impact on legibility. The same icon is often used at different sizes on the same screen. Iconic, with its three-size icon system, allows you the flexibility to adjust an icon dynamically based on the context of its use in your design for improved display and legibility.\nIcon Styling: One icon, infinite possibilities\nThe advent of CSS marked one of the biggest leaps in possibilities for web design. SVG allows that same creative potential to be brought to vector imagery and iconography. To fully and usably take advantage of this functionality, icon elements must be well structured when created and designed thoughtfully.\nIconic is being designed with this in mind from day one which means the final SVG icons will be semantically clear and primed for styling. You will have a tremendous amount of control over styling to match your aesthetic needs\u2014with just standard CSS that you already know and love.\n...and more?\nWe have even more tricks up our sleeve. We've been busy exploring, experimenting and pushing boundaries. This includes support for emerging formats and technologies like Web Components, CFF, WebP, SVG 2.0, a top-notch, multiweight, unicode-mapped icon web font implementation, SVG animation and a powerful SVG DOM injection tool that would make our advanced display techniques simple and easy to use. The more funding we get, the more you'll receive.\nA Full Open Source Icon Toolkit\nAnyone who's worked with icons knows that customizing a full set takes time and effort. For icon designers, this is the most tedious part of their job. For designers simply looking to use icons, it's an unnecessary burden. This whole process is just begging for automation. We will develop an improved toolkit that can be used for any vector icons, not just ours. All tools and code will be open source and publicly available on Github.\nThis toolkit will include:\nHelpful ExtendScripts to make Adobe Illustrator workflow easier\nThere are far too few resources for icon designers looking to speed up their workflow in Adobe Illustrator\u2014especially when it comes to automating exports. Iconic will include open source ExtendScripts to make various Illustrator workflow processes faster and less error-prone.\nAutomated output with Grunt.js\nIf you haven't used Grunt yet, you're missing out. We love it and we're sure you will too. We will be using Grunt to create a suite of command-line automation tools which will use Iconic's SVG files to generate fonts, raster files, sprites, and various other permutations along with supporting CSS, LESS and SASS for styling. \nSerious documentation\nWe're packing a lot into Iconic; a lot of things that aren't even icons. We want this project to set new standards for icon use on the web and to help people use icons in new and interesting ways. The only way that will happen is if we do a good job explaining them. Our documentation will include: code-samples and guidance for all the many ways to use Iconic along with step-by-step tutorials on setting up and productively using Iconic's toolkit.\nWe also want this project to help you make better icons of your own, so included in the documentation will be tips and tricks to help you 1-up your icon design skills.\nBonus: Designing icons for wrangly subject matter\nIconic is going to include more than just the usual suspects. We're also going to be tackling subject matter that is difficult to convey in icon form. The hope is to help create new symbolic representations for subject material that either doesn't have a standard or has one that is grossly outdated*.\n* Yes, the save icon will be redesigned\u2026\nImportant Questions\nHow many icons?\nGreat question! The short answer: Ultimately it's up to you, the backers. The amount of icons we make depends on how well the project is supported.\nThe goal of Iconic is to provide the most forward-thinking icon set available, not to win an icon count contest. With each icon being created in three sizes the total number of icons effectively triples the size of the set (and the work for us!). Additionally, the icons are going to be built in a way that will prime them for animation, styling and other new interesting approaches. Rest assured, by reaching the project's $15,000 goal we will be significantly extending the existing set and, depending on your pledge level, you'll have the opportunity to influence the icons we create.\nWhy go commercial?\nIt's challenging to continually extend and support a project without some financial backing\u2014especially on a project with such an advanced focus. Iconic is as much R&D work as it is icon design, and good R&D work is time intensive. We want Iconic to stay on the leading-edge of new thinking and technology and by generating revenue we'll be able to reinvest in its continued advancement.\nWhat about the existing Iconic?\nAlthough this new version of Iconic will be commercial, it's important to state that the current open source version of Iconic will remain freely available. Any improvements to the icons currently in the set will be transferred to Open Iconic. The commercial version will simply expand on it. All the core tools you need will be GPL licensed as well. Ironically, by making Iconic commercial we will be able to make an even greater commitment to open source projects.\nHow will I be able to get Iconic after launch?\nOnce Iconic is finished, you will be able to buy the set (consisting of all icons, tools, techniques and documentation). As an added bonus, our static SVG icons will available after launch on The Noun Project ala-carte or through their new API.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs part of the Iconic development process we will be trying many unique and new approaches to icon design and display\u2014some of which rely on newer technologies and possibly yet-to-be-widely-released browser features. In doing so, not all our ideas result in successful, well-supported features. This is part of the risk of trying something new.\n\nWe'll likely run into cases where some things will work most of the time for most icons, but not all of them on every browser, device and platform. Typical of many advanced web techniques and tools, our goal will be to identify those potential issues and clearly document them, along with possible workarounds and alternatives.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Get ready for the web GUI!", "update_content": "Well, it's finally happened.

THANKS SO MUCH TO EVERYONE FOR BACKING THIS POSSIBLE AND MAKING THIS APP A REALITY. FOR MORE ON THE APP AND OTHER TRAVEL TIPS, BE SURE TO CHECK OUT MY SITE, NOMADICMATT.COM!!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - Infinity! \nWow! We hit our second funding goal!!! Awesome! Now I can make this app for both iOS and Android phones. Even though we hit our goals, don't let that discourage you from backing this project. All extra money goes back into future updates of the app. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $15,000\nWow! We hit our first funding goal!!! Awesome! The next funding goal is $15,000 so we can fund for both iOS and Android! There's plenty of backing levels left to make this happen! Let's get there and get this app to everyone!! \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHello, my name is Matthew Kepnes and am the author of How to Travel the World on $50 a Day as well as run the budget travel website, Nomadic Matt. I'm here on Kickstarter to talk about my budgeting app, TripSaver. The app is already has a prototype but I'm here get your help in completing it. My advice has been featured in:\nIn 2006, I left to travel around the world. I had a limited amount of money that needed to last for eighteen months. To keep track of my money and expenses, I wrote everything down in a Moleskine notebook (I filled up two). This helped me know what I spending on but didn\u2019t let me see the big picture \u2013 was my spending too much or too little for the destination I was in? Plus, it was a pain in the butt to constantly account for currency changes and keep a running tab of eighteen months worth of expenses! \nOver the years as I\u2019ve become a leading writer on budget travel, people often say to me that they didn\u2019t know how much a place costs, whether their spending was too high, or that they ended up realizing they were spending too much money too late. In short, they found it hard to manage, keep track, and budget their money properly on the road. \nThat\u2019s a problem I can relate to. Those moleskin notebooks left a lot to be desired. \nI thought to myself \"why isn\u2019t there an app that besides letting you put in your expenses tells you if you are over or under not only YOUR budget but a suggested budget for the country based on your travel style!!??\" That way you would know if you really are overspending or if you can afford to order a few more rounds! \nPlus, it would give you a foolproof way to account for your spending and take into account currency changes! No more calculating exchange rates manually! \nThis app puts my experience and expertise in your pocket and makes tracking your spending, keeping a budget easy, saves you from carrying around notebooks or dealing with spreadsheets on a computer. \nTravel is not expensive. Seven years of traveling the world and writing about it taught me that once you break out of the hotel/vacation dynamic, a plethora of opportunities to save money happen. You can easily travel most of the world on $50 a day or less! \nBut to keep doing that, we all need to keep track of our spending so we can keep it under control and continue to travel cheaper, smarter, and longer. \nBy helping make this app a reality, you\u2019ll be able to get the best of budget travel in your pocket, whenever you need it. \nMY GOAL WITH THIS APP \nThe goal of this iPhone app is to help you keep track of your expenses, see the break down of your spending, and compare your spending to a baseline based on your travel style. \nThe app's features are: \nEnter your expenses \nSee pie and bar graphs of your spending \u2013 both daily and over time \nSee your expenses based on a suggested budget for each destination \nSet your travel style to backpacker, budget, mid-range, and luxury and your suggested spending amount will be adjusted based on that! \nE-mail your expenses to yourself, friend, or to Excel! \nSee a breakdown of all your spending based on category \n\nScreenshots of the Trip Saver app\n\n\nWHAT MAKES THIS APP AWESOME? \nThere are a lot of other apps out there but none that breaks anything down by travel type, destination, or lets you see your spending over time. That\u2019s why this app is different and awesome. Because it allows you to see the benchmark and let you know if you are spending too much money not only relative to your spending goals but also the average for the country. \nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\n100% of this money will go to pay for the development of the app.\nGot questions?\nAsk me!! I want to hear from you!\nMatt Kepnes \u2013 matt@nomadicmatt.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any technical development project, there can be difficulties and hurdles, but my developer and I are confident this project can be finished and submitted without issues.

And candy, and chocolate, and beer...\nEnter the quantified kitchen.\nCorrect temperature and time are critical to making so much good food (and drink). With recipe graphs, you'll be able to watch temperature over time, share and compare with past batches. Combined with temperature band templates for common kitchen activities like candymaking and meatmaking, you'll be able to see where your recipe went wrong or so very, very right.\nThe story\nAfter talking to many of our Twine backers who cared about monitoring temperature, we realized that many of them made food and drink as both professionals and enthusiasts, and wanted to do it better. This struck a chord with those of us who love experimenting in the kitchen, or tinkering with old family recipes. We realized that we could make a useful kitchen tool for food makers who care about perfection.\nThere's nothing out there that feels as good as our other kitchen tools. We've seen a lot of creaky plastic gadgets and unimaginative apps. We wanted to design something that belongs in the jar with your other kitchen utensils. No batteries or wireless troubleshooting, and a durable silicone clip-on handle. Range is a tool, and tools disappear into the task.\nFeatures\nWe've worked hard to miniaturize the electronic guts so that what you see looks deceptively simple. You\u2019ll use Range to craft the perfect meal; we crafted Range to let you do just that. Range is simple to use, but rich in information when you want it; we designed the app and thermometers with your needs in mind.\nHardware\nAqua Range has a 6-inch rounded tip (when the handle is clipped onto something, that's a total of 8 inches). Designed for many tasks including candy making, beer brewing, and cheese making. (Planned retail price: $59) \nEmber Range has a 3-inch pointed tip. Ideal for cooking meat. (Planned retail price: $59)\nCoal Range has a 3-inch pointed tip. Made with higher-temperature materials that make it ideal for heavy grill use.\nRange (including the cable) is made of food-safe, eco-friendly, good-feeling, free-range silicone that can be handwashed and withstand temperatures up to 450\u00baF.\nThermometer reads from -40\u00baF to 450\u00baF (-40\u00baC to 230\u00baC), with 0.5\u00baF accuracy at 135\u00baF (about the temperature of a medium rare steak).\nDesigned to allow you to clip it onto the side of a pot or on a rack. Use your hands for cooking, not fussing with technology.\nPlugs into the headphone jack of your iOS device for maximum reliability. A long cable keeps your device safely on the counter where you're using it for recipes.\nStretch goal achieved: All Ranges now have a 4.5-foot cable. Aqua and Ember have a thin silicone cable good to 450\u00baF, and Coal has a thicker extreme-temperature cable that can withstand bursts of direct flame.\nStretch goal achieved: Magnetically pin the cable onto any metal surface to keep it neat and out of the way. (Aqua and Ember only.)\nHave an old iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch sitting in a drawer? Connect it to Range to send notifications to any iOS device with the Range app.\nSoftware\nUse with any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch on iOS 5.1 and newer (iPhone 3GS and newer, iPod touch 3rd generation and newer, any iPad). \nSend push notifications to any iOS device with the Range app.\nSet alerts at multiple temperatures with a flick of your thumb. Get notified when temperatures rise or fall past your mark.\nUse presets that have custom notification sounds. \nSwitch to gourmet temperature recommendations for juicier results.\nUse recipe graphs to see how the temperature changes over time.\nUse Range-Finder templates to view temperature bands to target for meat, candy, and other classes of edible items.\nStretch goal achieved: Create your own Range-Finder templates for your favorite, finicky beer or chocolate recipe.\nSave and share visual results as a counterpart to your recipes, and use them as a guide to get repeatable results the next time you recreate that beer recipe.\nCan display temperatures in Fahrenheit or Celsius.\n\nPledge Levels\nWhat we've done\nAs with any good recipe, our process gets better with every repetition. Range is the latest result of our recipe for making great products.\nWe've prepared for several production scenarios, and have picked and vetted most of our suppliers. As much of the work as possible is done locally in Texas and the US \u2014 not only because it's important to support our neighbors, but because it produces more reliable results, especially when demand grows but the schedule doesn't.\nThe video and images here show some of the work we've done so far. We have a solid design after many iterations of sketches as well as carved, printed, and cast prototypes. We've built and tested several prototypes of the electronics, making them smaller each time. And we've been building an iOS app that already looks at home in iOS 7 (we're just ahead of the curve like that).\nWhat we do next\nThis Kickstarter will fund the remainder of our development, allow us to meet the minimum order quantities for parts, and help us secure equipment needed for production. Your Kickstarter pledges help us fund electronic components, the tooling and materials for injection molding the silicone parts, assembly, certifications, packaging, and shipping. The more funds we raise, the quicker we'll be able to make Range better.\nHere's our timeline: \nWe are finalizing the electronic and industrial design in August. \nIn September, we'll be able to buy components in quantity as soon as we receive the funds, and we'll start beta testing and tooling for the parts. \nBy October, we'll have hardware we can commit to production. \nBy the end of November, we should have the first Ranges to assemble and test, and we'll start packaging and shipping this first batch in time for the holidays. \nAfter a breather to make perfect turkey and caramel for our families, we'll then be able to ramp up full production and fulfillment in the first months of 2014.\nMaking things doesn't always unfold so neatly, but we've built in some padding in case something happens (it always does).\nIf you like what we do and want to be part of it, contribute to our project with your dollars, word of mouth, and creative ideas. Let's get cooking!\nAbout us\nSupermechanical is making a new generation of everyday objects that connect people. You may remember us from Twine, a little square that's the easiest way to get your objects and environments talking on the Internet. Our work, started at the MIT Media Lab, has been featured on The Verge, Wired, Engadget, the Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, and Cool Hunting. We want to give soul to electronics, and make connections between us.\nMusic written and performed by Russ Bonsall, a brewer and a patriot.\nWe've done this before.\nThis is not just a pre-order! Kickstarter is not a store. Yes, you'll be among the first to get an original new product; but on Kickstarter, you're helping us finish the product as well. As both project creators and backers, we embrace the process with all its ups and downs. Big companies have the same challenges, but they don't open their doors to you until they're ready to sell \u2014 this is part of the fun with Kickstarter. Read this \u2014 we believe it. \nThat said, we learned a lot about the challenges of building and shipping hardware from Twine, and we\u2019ve put that knowledge to use with Range in everything from the design and development, to how we interact with you, our backers. This Kickstarter will feature even more communication, less naivet\u00e9, and an equal amount of passion.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery hardware product has a supply chain. Different companies may provide components, make custom parts, and assemble electronics. Each link in the chain can be a failure point \u2014 a part has to be redone because it's not up to our specifications, an overseas shipment gets delayed, etc.\n\nWe've already vetted and picked suppliers, many of whom we've worked with before. Most of them are in the US, which makes things faster and more reliable (and because we like to support our neighbors and keep a smaller carbon footprint). We\u2019ve separated rewards into anticipated delivery dates based on production runs so that we\u2019ll be able to get everyone their rewards when promised, even if we need to make more than expected.\n\nIn addition to the risks involved in making hardware, we'll be at the mercy of Apple for approval in the App Store.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Give your chef a thermometer that lets them unplug.", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #59", "update_userinfo": "Upgrade your Range thermometer to Bluetooth", "update_content": "Hi, backers!

The game has gone on to become a staple of tech conferences and gaming conventions, and many players, including myself, consider it to be one of the most difficult and elegant games ever created.\nThere are dozens of published versions of Werewolf, but I think many of them are overcomplicated and ugly, and some even require special parts and pieces to play.\nI'd like to make my own set of simple, beautiful Werewolf cards, and get them to you affordably.\nEach set comes with 20 cards in a custom zipper case, with a keychain loop so you can hook it on to your backpack. The roles included are:\nThree werewolves\nOne doctor\nOne seer\nOne witch\n14 villagers (7 male, 7 female)\nTo help teach people about my favorite game, I've also created an open source compendium of information about Werewolf.

We are on the floor with gratitude, but humbly, we ask you: if you can find it in your hearts to keep donating and keep shouting out, exceeding our $75K goal means we may be able to consider many aspects of great filmmaking that were previously unattainable to us.  With more money, we can hire more and better-paid crew members.  We can license songs and images to round out our 2004 landscape.  We can bring more people to our Wisconsin shoot.  And so much more.  Help Farah Goes Bang crack $100K to become one of Kickstarter's highest-grossing film campaigns of ALL TIME!\nExciting casting updates!\nOur Farah is...Circumstance actress Nikohl Boosheri!  Circumstance, a forbidden-love story of two young women in Tehran, won a nearly outrageous number of 2011 film festival awards, including the Sundance Audience Award. It was named the year\u2019s \u201cmost anticipated\u201d independent film by the New York Times, and was one of Paste Magazine\u2019s 50 best films of 2011. Nikohl\u2019s was named Best Performance at both the Rome, LA OutFest and Noor Film Festivals. We know that Nikohl\u2019s talent and stardom will help our film reach similar acclaim!\nKiran Deol, an actress, comedian and documentary filmmaker, will co-star as Roopa Raj, a political junkie who blazes a trail across America for the Kerry campaign in the hopes of earning a job at the John Kerry White House.  Deol, a graduate of Harvard University, directed the feature documentary Woman Rebel, which premiered on HBO and was nominated for an Emmy Award.  Kiran\u2019s outsize intelligence and outrageous wit will illuminate the role of Roopa.\nGrace Parra as Nancy\nSamrat Chakrabarti as Anoop\nKate French as Katie\nThe press likes us:\nFeministing\nSan Francisco Bay Guardian\nThe Sexy Grammarian\nThe Rumpus\nHyphen\nRacialicious\nThe Faster Times\nThe Film Stage\nIndieWIRE Project of the Day\nWomen and Hollywood\nTHE FILM\nFARAH GOES BANG tells the story of Farah Mahtab, a woman in her twenties who tries to lose her virginity while on the road campaigning for presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004. Farah and her friends K.J. and Roopa follow the campaign trail across historic Route 66 on their way to Ohio, the central battleground state of 2004, seizing control of this charged moment in their lives and the life of their country. FARAH GOES BANG is Thelma & Louise meets Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n meets On The Road: the film was co-written by Meera Menon and Laura Goode, will be directed by Meera Menon, and will be produced by Laura Goode, Liz Singh, and Danielle Firoozi.  \nFARAH GOES BANG is a valentine to contemporary feminism, youth in revolt, and the passionate politics of idealism. It is the travelogue of three women out on a highway belonging not to suicidal housewives or bubblegum pop stars, but to young women as agents, as doers, as authors of their own American odyssey. In this way, FARAH updates the classic American tradition of the Western, telling a new trail story--whose subjects are both cowgirls and Indians, both heroines and outlaws--in a diverse, powerful, and hilarious female voice.  \nOUR CAMPAIGN\nWith this campaign, our team aims to raise $75,000 or more in the month of April to fund production of the film in June and July 2012. Visit our website at www.farahgoesbang.com to learn more about the film, the community we\u2019re building with our blog, Cherry Bomb, and the conversations we\u2019re having on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and YouTube. \nWHO WE ARE\nThe FARAH GOES BANG project is an intensely personal one for co-writers Meera Menon (director) and Laura Goode (producer), who have been friends, collaborators, and sometime roommates for almost ten years, and who have dreamed of making a movie together for pretty much all of those years.  After producing four short films and a full-length play together, receiving our respective MFAs in film and writing, and spending two years co-writing the FGB script, it feels uniquely appropriate for us to be making a film about friends who make each other laugh, tell each other secrets, and constantly challenge each other to grow. \n\nHOW KICKSTARTER WORKS\nIt\u2019s easy: all you have to do is sign up for a free account, give any amount you can, and claim your reward. Your donation amount will not be publicly displayed, and we receive your funds only if we meet our full $75,000 goal. If you\u2019d rather not claim a reward, you\u2019re welcome just to donate, and if you\u2019d like to increase your donation at any point during the campaign, just sign in, come back to this page, and click the blue \u201cManage Your Donation\u201d button to enter a new amount or choose a new incentive.\n\nCONTACT US\nWe love hearing from our supporters and prospective supporters, and have always hoped this film would inspire lots of new conversations.

You may remember seeing a page very similar to this one just several months back. Earlier this year, we were fundraising to launch production on an ambitious short film project titled The Handout Saint, and now we're back after months of preparing, shooting, and editing, to finish the project and submit it to several dozen major film festivals. \nFor those of you not already familiar, The Handout Saint tells the story of Felicity Adamson, a young woman living in New York City who suffers from a rare condition in which she's predisposed to developing addictions to just about anything she finds enjoyable. After numerous battles with substance abuse and bizarre addictions, she turns to compulsive charity as her new high, and has a profound encounter with reciprocity.\nThe film is just a hair from completion, requiring only a final color grading job, and  a final audio mix featuring original music currently being finished by our friends with FREE BLOOD (Check out \"Never Hear Surf Music Again\" from 127 Hours). We only need about $2,000 to put the finishing touches on the film, a part of which we are trying to raise right here on Kickstarter. \nEven great films are pointless if nobody sees them, so we're also raising as much as we can to help pay for festival submissions and exhibition expenses (digital prints, venue rentals, key crew travel for festivals). We've worked very hard on a project we believe in, and we'd love to have your support in taking it worldwide! \nWe've set a pretty low minimum, but keep in mind we have no maximum. Your liberal giving is sincerely appreciated. \nHere's where we plan to submit to (so far):\nAnn Arbor Film Festival\nAspen Shortsfest\nAtlanta Film Festival\nBerlin International Film Festival\nBoulder International Film Festival*\nCinequest Film Festival (San Jose)*\nCleveland International Film Festival\nDallas International Film Festival\nRhode Island International Film Festival\nFlorida Film Festival\nGarden State Film Festival\nGlasgow Film Festival*\nIndependent Film Festival of Boston\nLondon Independent Film Festival\nMaryland Film Festival\nNashville Film Festival\nNewport Beach Film Festival*\nOmaha Film Festival\nPalm Beach Film Festival\nPhoenix Film Festival*\nPortland International Film Festival\nRiverRun International Film Festival\nRiverside International Film Festival\nSonoma International Film Festival\nSan Francisco International Film Festival*\nSan Luis Obispo International Film Festival\nSanta Barbara International Film Festival\nSanta Cruz Film Festival\nSeattle International Film Festival\nSlamdance Film Festival*\nSundance Film Festival*\nTribeca Film Festival*\n*Already submitted!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "10 backers pledged $550"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 1, 2011"}]}], "comments": []}}]
