[{"backer": "Jean-Philippe Encausse", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introducing Gamma, the ultimate all-climate jacket. Gamma Jacket is a durable, lightweight, insulated jacket that doesn\u2019t compromise function or fashion. Building on graphene's amazing properties, Gamma is your everyday jacket, your travel jacket, your activewear, and your going-out jacket. \n\nBack us today and discover why Gamma is the only layer you'll ever need whether you're hiking the Ko\u02bbolau ranges in Hawaii or skiing in the Swiss Alps or biking to work.\nWhether you are hiking in the mountains or popping into town for a coffee, the heat-insulating design will warm you up in a matter of seconds. Gamma is the only jacket you\u2019ll need all year round, all around the globe.\nGraphene is what makes Gamma unlike any other activewear. Graphene is a nano-lattice - just one atom thick, yet it\u2019s stronger than diamond. Known as \u201csupreme graphene\u201d for its long list of properties and benefits, graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and most flexible known material.\nBy infusing a graphene layer into the Gamma Jacket, we were able to create a new kind of outerwear. Gamma functions as a winter jacket, a cool-weather jacket, a windbreaker, a rain jacket, and activewear all at once.\nWhile traditional synthetic insulation is the standard, it\u2019s nowhere near the level of warmth that a graphene-infused jacket has. Gamma takes graphene-integrated clothing to a whole new level of modern sustainability and style. Lightweight, all-seasonal, strong, and breathable.\nGraphene\u2019s thermal properties have been called revolutionary. It is able to adapt to your body almost like a second skin. Graphene moves heat through its latticed structure, evenly distributing it around your body. In warm weather, it expels heat and wicks moisture to keep you cool.\nGraphene conducts heat from your body and Gamma\u2019s built-in heaters and channels it throughout the jacket. In cold weather, it evenly distributes heat to your entire upper-body. In hot weather, it expels heat through its permeable pores.\nWith Gamma, you won\u2019t have to wear multiple layers or bulky coats. Gamma\u2019s graphene layer will regulate its temperature based on your environment, so you\u2019ll stay comfortable in temperatures from warm to frigid.\n\nFrom city strolls to hikes to snowsports, Gamma will keep you at your ideal temperature.\nGamma is equipped with 3 carbon fiber heating elements built directly into the jacket. When your body heat isn\u2019t enough, you can supercharge Gamma\u2019s graphene layer at the push of a button.\n\nWithin seconds, the heaters will begin to warm the jacket, and graphene will distribute the heat to your entire upper-body. Graphene\u2019s thermoregulating properties also ensure the jacket won\u2019t become too hot.\n\nGamma\u2019s built-in heaters will keep you warm and comfortable even in sub-zero conditions. No need for more layers, even on the coldest days.\n\nGamma\u2019s heaters are powered by any power bank. Just plug it into the USB-A input in the inner pocket and the jacket will begin to heat up.\nCombined with graphene's thermoregulating properties, unlike other materials, Gamma will never overheat or ignite. Even if you leave the heater on or fall asleep in the jacket, there is no risk of burns or overheating.\n\nGamma's built in heater comes with 3 adjustable temperature settings that you can cycle through with the press of a button to help fight every kind of cold!\nThese are estimates tested in ideal conditions and may not be precise as various conditions including temperature, your power bank's efficiency, etc. may affect the final achievable time.\nThe carbon fiber heating elements won\u2019t restrict your movement or weigh you down. Because the jacket doesn\u2019t contain any electrical parts or batteries, you can machine wash it without the risk of damage.\nGamma contains many pockets, including several hidden pockets, making it practical at home and safe while traveling. Anything you used to stuff in your tote bag can now be stored in your jacket.\nHead to the campground, office, or airport with everything you need close to your body with Gamma's secure pockets.  \n\nGamma\u2019s fit is fully adjustable to ensure your comfort and to protect you from the elements, whenever you need it.\nAdjustable drawstrings in the hood and waist lock in heat and protect against wind. \nVelcro cuffs and a high neck secure your wrists and guard sensitive skin.\nBuilt-in fingerless gloves to protect your hands without hindering your grip.\n  Tired of heavy jackets and puffy layers?\n\nGamma is the solution. Graphene isn\u2019t just the strongest known material. It\u2019s also the thinnest. At one atom thick, it\u2019s lighter than air\u2014literally. This makes Gamma incredibly lightweight and flexible\u2014perfect for folding, storing, packing, and shoving in your backpack. Traveling with Gamma can save heaps of space in your luggage, especially for minimalist backpackers.\nNote: as we continue development and prototyping, Gamma's final weight may either increase or decrease as we build out our final product and fabric mix. \nGamma weighs as much as the average hoodie. Yet, it can keep you warm as well as a thick winter coat.\nGraphene, a material stronger than diamond, can resist almost all forms of damage. It's scratch-proof, puncture-proof, tear-proof, and abrasion-proof. Feel safe in Gamma knowing you can wear it in the toughest conditions.\nGamma resists surface wear caused by rubbing or scratching, resisting scuffing or tear. You can expect Gamma to still look like fresh and new after years of heavy use.\nNote: Gamma has not been tested / certified to be bulletproof, cut-proof, or knife-proof and should never be used as a safety device. We also do not recommend as a complete replacement over a certified motorcycle jacket as it does not have padding or shielding. \nGraphene is able to expel heat without letting cold air inside the jacket, so you\u2019ll never feel that sticky, sweaty feeling you get from most shells, rain jackets, and winter coats.\nGraphene\u2019s semipermeable structure also makes Gamma the ideal jacket for warmer weather in autumn and spring. Gamma will keep you cool when the sun comes out by releasing excess heat\u2014graphene knows when to do this by detecting and reacting to your body temperature.\nIf you\u2019re using Gamma as sportswear, graphene will pull heat and moisture away from your body, moving it to the outer surface of the jacket and expelling it into the air. When you\u2019re on the slopes, jogging, or ice skating, Gamma will keep you feeling cool while maintaining your core temperature.\nDon\u2019t worry about working up a sweat in Gamma. Graphene is 100% anti-odor, meaning no odor-causing contaminants can grow on the jacket.\n\nGraphene interacts with sweat odors and neutralizes the smell through ionic conduction, efficiently removing bad smells and neutralizing any harmful substances on its surface.\nWith Gamma, never worry about your jacket smelling like sweat.\nGamma was built for unforgiving alpine conditions. Combining the naturally wind resistant and water resistant nature of Graphene's compact atomic bonds and our proprietary weave, Gamma is waterproof and windproof. \nWhether you\u2019re strolling in a light mist or stuck in a monsoon, you can count on Gamma to keep you dry and warm.\nEven though Gamma is lightweight and thin, its graphene infused technology is effective up to 50 Miles per hour / 80 Kilometers per hour winds.  Gamma is an absolute must whether you're just road biking or doing some high altitude skiing or hiking.\n\nDid you know that harmful UV rays can penetrate many light jackets, windbreakers, and raincoats? This can cause burns and skin damage when outdoors for long periods.  Gamma is UV-proof and keeps your skin safe from the sun when you're outdoors. \nGraphene repels UV light, also helping you to stay cool in the sun. \nGamma is designed and sized for a comfortable yet slim look. The tailored fit is neither too loose or too tight, creating high flexibility for the wearer. \n\nAll our sizing and designs are unisex so your sizing may not map. Make sure to take measurements. Sizing will be selected at the end of the crowdfunding campaign through surveys.\nWe charge no restocking fee for size exchanges, but customer must ship the product to us at their own expense. Depending on reshipped address, we may pass on part of the cost of reshipping up to $15-25 USD. Jacket must come back unwashed and in brand-new condition with no visible scuffs, marks, or discolorations. \nThe story of Wear Graphene started back in 2004, when graphene was first discovered. Graphene was such a monumental discovery \u2014 the strongest and thinnest material on Earth \u2014 that it earned its discoverers a Nobel Prize.\n\nAbout 10 years later, scientists first began to understand how to incorporate graphene into fabric. \n\nThis is where we come in. Our team is composed of young visionaries that want to make a change in the world by innovating new products using cutting edge materials. Our team believes that high fashion and technology can be combined to bring smart clothing to the next level.\n\nBut we knew that with graphene, our smart clothing would do more. It\u2019s also anti-odor, UV-proof, waterproof, wind-proof, damage-proof, and so much more. It\u2019s the most versatile and high-performance jacket ever made. And we think it looks pretty cool too.\n\n The Gamma! We have to fast forward to show you all the features and pockets in one go!\nPLAY\n\nUntil recently, we have focused our marketing for Gamma in Asia. Now, we would like to grow our presence overseas, starting on Kickstarter to \u201ckickstart\u201d our brand globally. Our existing supply chains and processes will allow us to manufacture and fulfill your order quickly.\n\nWe hope that you share our passion for smart and sustainable clothing and choose to become a backer of Gamma Jacket!\n\nWear Graphene is a Hong Kong-based team of scientists, designers, and business people who are dedicated to changing the way you wear clothes. With a focus on innovating through technology and sustainability, our team has developed a completely new type of graphene-infused smart clothing that we\u2019re very proud of.\n\nThe team is excited to launch our first product to a global market with Gamma Jacket.  \nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have had ample experience in design, manufacturing, and sales in the past.

But smell? Not really! \nSmell Inspector is a developer\u2019s kit and ready-to-use electronic nose gadget in one. For anyone working on smart systems - from developers or scientists to tinkerers. Immediately usable for manufacturers who want to control their production environment and the quality of their products.\nSmell inspector is a digital nose, which works with the same principle as a human nose. Train it and create your own specific use case for single gases, gas mixtures or smells.\n\nComponents\nSmell Inspector\nThe gadget contains Smell Board iX16\u00d74 with four Smell iX16 detectors, can be connected to a PC, tablet or smartphone and can be operated with the Smell Annotator software. Compatible with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.\nSmell Board iX16x4\nElectronic board with four Smell iX16 detector chips, providing full functionality to read signals from all 64 individual detectors every 1.8 s and send them out in ASCII format. Can be integrated into different mobile or stationary appliances. \nSmell iX16\nThis is our core invention: The first multi-channel gas detector chip designed to conquer the mass market. The sensor elements contain fine-tuned carbon nanomaterials which make the chip highly sensitive, small, energy efficient and affordable. There are four Smell iX16 detector chips on the electronic board. The current version has 64 detectors (16 channels per detector chip) with a size of less than 1sqmm (0.08sqinch) each. Further miniaturization and / or increasing the number of detectors can easily be done. The detector chip Smell iX16 only needs 1 \u00b5W of power supply. It can thus be powered by various host devices, energy harvesters or batteries. Smell iX16 is designed for use in unlimited miniaturized electronic and IoT applications in various areas. The detector chip has a high sensitivity to different gases and VOCs.\nSmell Annotator\nSmell Annotator is an AI based software used to detect, annotate and digitize smells with the Smell Inspector as well as to recognize annotated smells. Digital smell patterns are produced by 64 independent gas detectors. Through artificial intelligence our technology learns to recognise particular smells. This can be compared to the way information is processed in our olfactory system. Smell is initially collected and analysed in the olfactory bulb. For recognition and remembering the cortical brain areas get involved. This evolves over our whole lifetime with more and more \u201edata\u201c processed. The same principle is realized in the Smell Inspector supported with the Smell Annotator software which uses machine learning algorithms.Currently, Windows and Linux systems are supported. Android and iOS will follow.\nGoals\nIntroduce an innovative product with a disruptive technology to the market\nOffer a low cost embedded platform for smell detection and recognition\nProvide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping of products related to smell\nEnable engineers, researchers, designers, makers, tinkerers, software developers\u2026 to create new products and services in relation to smell\nGive a boost to the maker\u00b4s world / DIY community\nBuild up a worldwide developer\u2019s community for smell related applications\nCreate a world\u2019s largest digital smell database\nSingle Pack: Pick a single Smell Inspector Developer's Kit to build your unique smell-related application and start the digital smell revolution.\nExplorer Set: Connect to your friends, makers, developers, scientists and choose your Explorer Set to invent great smell-related applications and products in a common, open and creative lab environment.

It is a joint effort of a multidisciplinary team of researchers and industry experts with expertise in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, bioengineering, software development, industrial engineering, marketing and business development in collaboration with the German excellence university TU Dresden and German Life Science Inkubator, who along the years have worked together in several projects sharing the same vision about smell recognition.\nFrom the left: Marcel H\u00e4ndler (M.Sc.), Julius Hickl, Viktor Bezugly (Ph.D.), Birte S\u00f6nnichsen (Ph.D.), Vyacheslav Khavrus (Ph.D.), Andreas Werner (M.Sc.)\nWhatever happens on the way \u2013 we will keep you informed. \nBuilding a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. As we have done in the past on our Facebook and LinkedIn page and our email list, you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated on our status and potential delays at least one update per month on Kickstarter.\n\n Technology Evolution\n5 generations of detector chips, 3 generations of PCB, 3 versions of software - from research to product\nThe technology is based on more than 10 years of research at TU Dresden which is a reputable German university. We have produced several kinds of prototypes (detector chips as well as circuit boards) as it can be seen in the pictures above. Currently we are in the middle of the process of producing our first serial sample. To this end we are working together with Turck duotec a renown German EMS company. Current pilot projects are underway at Turck duotec GmbH, the American sensor manufacturer Centaur Analytics Inc. as well as at the German renown technical universities TU Dresden and TU Munich.\nTesting the first printed detector chips on foil mounted on the second generation Demo Board in our gas measuring chamber.\nThe laboratory and measuring equipment has been designed and manufactured in-house and is the result of an intense thinking process and hard working hours in the laboratory.\nPreparing the equipment for the in-house production of our nanomaterials. The production and fine-tuning of the nanomaterials for the detector chips Smell iX16 is one  of our key know-hows.\nWe have intensely analysed different kinds of smells. Using a simplified smell testing setup we could reliably test different gases, VOCs and smells: \ngases and VOCs: ammonia, nitrogen monoxide, phosphine, carbon dioxide, water vapour, ethanol, acetone (and other ketones), isopropanol, toluene, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, 2,6-dimethaxy-phenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, guaiacol;\nsmells: different perfumes, chocolate, wine, vodka, coffee, tee, lemon juice, onion, garlic, banana, orange, potato, meat, fish (also spoiled banana, orange, potato, meat and fish), trash container.\nThe boards that you see on the pictures are real working prototypes tested by us and our partners. We are 80% ready to have the final product in our hands.\nThe production will follow these steps:\nComponents purchase\nWarehouse\nSMT\nAOL\nSmell iX16 detector chip production\nQuality control for Smell iX16\nComplete system assembly\nTests\nQuality control packaging\nShipping\nBack us now and help us make the Smell Inspector a reality!\nThe board design is in the final stage and our engineers are checking the electrical schematics and all the components to finalize the PCB development. Nevertheless, the Smell Inspector is not yet ready for the final users, as we still have some tasks regarding  the hardware and software:\nvalidation of Prototype B of the hardware,\nproduction of the test series,\nextending Smell Annotator software to Android and iOS,\nupscaling the quality control for the Smell iX16 detector chip production,\nextending our pre-set data collection to include smells for the most requested community application (stretch goal 1),\nsetting up and standardizing the digital smell database (stretch goal 2).\nKicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As a startup company, we can only get it done with your help. Next to building our community this is why you are so important to us: Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering the Smell Inspector, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship the Smell Inspector. With a treshold of \u20ac27,800 ($33,760)we would be able to validate prototype B of the Smell Inspector and start the production of the test series. \nIf all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production on schedule, ship the Smell Inspector to you in November 2021 and build a worldwide Smell Inspector community.\nSo \u2013 are you ready to become a Smell Inspector yourself?\nSpread the word! Encourage friends to become a Smell Inspector, too! \nThank you for being part of the smell digitization evolution!\nThe Kickstarter video was produced with support by ravir FILM.

We fine-tuned every bit to fit agile maneuverability into a palm-sized robot pet. You can bring Bittle to life by assembling its puzzle-like frame and downloading our demo codes on GitHub. You can also teach it new skills to win prizes in our community challenges. Bittle makes a perfect tool for learning, teaching, researching, or a surprising gift to impress your family and friends. Bittle is not a toy for small kids. We recommend parental guidance to appreciate its rich content and avoid damage or injury.\nBittle walking on the desk\nEvolving with an open-source gene, Bittle is an open platform to fuse multiple makers' gadgets into one organic system. With our customized Arduino board coordinating all instinctive and sophisticated movements, you can clip on various sensors to bring in perception. You could also inject artificial intelligence capabilities by mounting a Raspberry Pi or other AI chips through wired/wireless connections.\nBall tracking with an intelligent camera mounted on the head\nBittle is the second product of OpenCat, sibling of Nybble. Backed by a worldwide user group, you can find many tutorials and project ideas on the Internet. We make constant but tiny progresses every day. You can follow our social media (Instagram/Twitter @PetoiCamp) to get more frequent updates than newsletters. By posting on our forum, you can contribute to the community or simply make your wishes heard. We are always drawing the blueprint for futuristic robots! \nSelf-righting after falling from a slope (triggered by an infrared remote)\nBittle is a palm-sized robot that moves with four legs rather than wheels. Legged motion gives it more freedom to navigate unstructured terrains, and expresses the joy of life whenever it moves. Such dynamic maneuverability was only seen on a few luxury robots from the best labs or tycoon companies previously, such as Boston Dynamics Spot or Sony Aibo. We came up with a grassroots solution to simplify the system to make it affordable and mass-producible.\nWalk the dog. Click the image to see a longer clip.\nBittle is a compact system of five major components: body frame, actuator, electronics, battery, and the software to coordinate all the hardware to perform varied tasks. \nBody frame\nWe designed Bittle's interlocking frame as a 3D puzzle with very few screws involved. Most body parts are symmetric for simplicity and aesthetics.  \nPuzzle-like body frame. Click the image for the full assembling animation.\nIt's a pleasure to assemble and disassemble Bittle for teaching or maintenance. On average, it takes about one hour to put together the body from scratch.\nBuild a robot dog on your own!\nEach piece has gone through tens of iterations with 3D printing. We then use high strength injection-molded plastic to provide the best protection from collision and dust (it's NOT waterproof!). In the stress tests, the assembled robot can take an adult's stepping without breaking any components (do NOT try this at home!).  \nRolling down a step. Click the image for the full review video.\nWe also designed Bittle to be soft. Besides the elasticity of the material, the spring-loaded upper legs flatten the shock on joint servos to protect their gears. Bittle usually survives regular collisions. In the extreme cases, it will disintegrate at the designated \"weak link in the chain\", which is easy and cheap to reinstall or replace.\nPassive compliant joints\nWe designed the frame to be compatible with most 9g servos. You could order the \"Bittle Shell\" perk alone to compile your spare servos into a beautiful action figure!\nActuator\nWe visited several servo manufacturers and iterated many times to find the optimized parameters. It will be model P1S, a slim, fast servo with a controllable angle of 270 degrees.\nP1S servo\nWe use nine P1S servos to actuate Bittle. Eight of them are for walking joints, and one is for head panning. We will also include one spare servo for replacement, as brushed motors are consumable after a certain period of wearing. You may order the \"Bittle Servo Set\" perk if you expect to use Bittle intensively for teaching or researching.\nElectronics\nBittle is driven by NyBoard V1, a customized Arduino board with rich peripherals. We fully utilized the chip of a regular Arduino Uno to coordinate sophisticated motions. The board can drive at least 12 PWM servos, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is used for balancing. It stores \"muscle memory\" and detects body status (orientation and acceleration) for balancing. We provide an infrared remote to trigger basic movements. The board also listens to string commands from the serial port, such as \"walk\", \"sit\", or more detailed instructions for individual joints. \nNyBoardV1\n\nNyBoard V1 is a revision of NyBoard V0 that has been driving 2000 Nybbles all over the world. We continue to provide a 2x5 socket on NyBoard V1 for mounting Raspberry Pi. It powers the Pi and communicates with it through the serial or I2C network. The Pi gives Bittle the ability to analyze more sensory data, get connected to the Internet, and make decisions by itself. Due to Bittle's small size, it best fits Pi Zero and Pi 3A+. For larger Pi models, you will need to tilt the Pi and 3D print some supporting structures. \nRaspberry Pi 3 A+ and Pi camera on Bittle\nThanks to the Arduino and Raspberry Pi community, you can find many customization ideas for Bittle. There are four Seeed Grove sockets on NyBoard V1 for extensible modules. To make installation easier, we designed Bittle's head as a clip to bite on those modules. That explains why we created a dog out of OpenCat this time. We will compile a \"sensor pack\" perk, including an intelligent camera module, a gesture sensor, a PIR motion sensor, and some other useful sensors. There's also a screw hole inside Bittle's head for fixing additional modules. \nExtensible modules\nWe developed a Bluetooth dongle for wirelessly uploading codes and controlling Bittle from PC or smartphone Apps. We also developed a WiFi dongle for wirelessly communicating with Bittle. You can play with Bittle without messing around with cables. Wireless is also essential when you are studying balancing related motion planning. You can even utilize the computational power of a remote \"brain\" without being constrained by Bittle's size and cargo capacity. The dongles are compatible with our previous Nybble model. We will include one extra set for our Nybble backers as a \"Thank You\" gift. You will need to provide your email and order ID for Nybble in our later survey.  \nBluetooth and WiFi dongles\nFurthermore, we are developing an ESP32 development board with native Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. We have made a functional beta version called the \"BiBoard V0\" perk for developers. We expect a considerable performance boost, and you are welcome to join our exploration.\nBiBoard V0\nSoftware\nBittle is driven by our OpenCat code. It has 3K lines of Arduino codes excluding 3rd party libraries. It defines the minimal data structure and algorithms for performing quadruped motion. We also provide example commander and parser in Python so that you can send instructions from other devices. The code is already running on thousands of small quadruped robots, including many variants of OpenCat.  \nThe OpenCat codes are open source on Github\nYou can program Bittle at different levels in various coding environments, such as C in Arduino IDE and Python in the terminal. We are collaborating with TinkerGen, a STEM education company that kindly developed Codecraft (a graphical coding environment) for Bittle. They will also provide a free curriculum for you to learn programming in Codecraft and create a wide array of educational and fun projects with it!\nYou can code in Arduino IDE, Python, Codecraft, and many other environments\nWe plan to refactor Bittle's code between the production and release it before Bittle's delivery. You may start to explore the current OpenCat repository on GitHub to get familiar with the framework. We will announce new community challenges with huge prizes in the community section!   \nBittle climbing up a step under realtime instructions sent through Bluetooth\nBattery\nWe designed a Li-ion battery pack with a built-in charging and protection circuit. It can slide into the track underneath Bittle and tune its center of mass. It can power Bittle for at least one hour of continuous walking. It also has an RGB LED to indicate the battery's status.\nLi-ion battery with onboard charging and protection circuit\nWith the slide-in installation mechanism and an anti-reverse plug, it's not too hard to switch batteries. You may order extra batteries for uninterrupted researching or playing. With some reconfiguration, it can also power our previous Nybble models.\nYou can check this 30-min interview by Hackster.io for all the cool features. \nBittle is a perfect example to show \"small is big\". We wanted to encourage people to free their creativity and make wonderful things from limited resources. We have a growing community since the release of the OpenCat demo. We have @petoicamp on social media to update our fans about the progress of the project. After the launch of Nybble, we built the forum on our site (petoi.com) to discuss the project, showcase DIY models, and add function modules. \nPetoi Camp, the OpenCat forum\nLooking back at all the challenges we went through, the community was the most significant support that encouraged us to continue. We got thousands of backers to bring Nybble to life. Fans all around the world volunteered to translate our documentation into their languages. And many developers added new features to OpenCat. We cannot wait to see what Bittle will bring to us!  \nAn Android App (Code&Robots) developed by one of our fans\nTo make our community more productive, educational, and rewarding, we will launch an online challenge for all OpenCat users. You can find our proposed rules in this forum post and give suggestions before it officially starts. In short, we will define several tasks that can be measured quantitatively, e.g., programing Bittle to get onto the highest step. You have to both demo your solution and teach others to validate your entry. On the first day of each month, we will announce the world's record-breaker and gift a free Bittle or Nybble to the winner!\nWho will be the first Bittle backflipper and enter our Hall of Fame?\nBittle standing on my fingers\nBittle is 20cm x 11cm x 11cm in dimension. It weighs less than 280g but can carry up to 450g cargo under its belly. With proper programming and calibration, It can run faster than two body lengths per second. Bittle can remember tens of instinctive motion patterns and can perform more fancy tricks with realtime instructions. \nBittle (250g) trotting with an iron cargo (465g)\nP1S servo uses a coreless motor, alloy gears, ball bearing, and plastic case. It's 8.4V compatible, high speed, and has a controllable range of 270 degrees.  \nBittle on a treadmill\nNyBoard V1 has an Atmega328P with 16MHz CPU, 2K SRAM, and 32K flash. We also added an 8K I2C EEPROM, an IMU, a servo driver for 12 PWM servos, an infrared receiver, and a buzzer. It has a 2x5 socked to mount on a Raspberry Pi. \nBiBoard V0 has an ESP32 with 240MHz dual-core CPU, 520KB SRAM, and up to 16M flash. It has built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, 12 PWM servo pins, an IMU, an infrared receiver, an audio amplifier, and a speaker. It has several communication ports to connect to other devices.  \nThe Bluetooth dongle is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Android. It can also work on IOS with some auxiliary software. It can be used for uploading Arduino sketch or communicating with the NyBoard. The WiFi module can host a simple WebUI and communicate with the NyBoard. \nBiBoard V0, NyBoard V1 with Raspberry Pi 3 A+, and NyBoard V1 with a Bluetooth dongle\nThe intelligent camera module is our ODMed product. It integrates multiple vision recognition algorithms running on its ESP32 dual-core processor. It can return recognized human body, objects, and symbols through serial/I2C/WiFi at a rate of 25fps or 50fps. It can even stream video through WiFi. We will also include a deck of symbol cards. You can refer to this link for more information.\nIntelligent camera module and the symbol deck\nWe compiled the sensor pack with Seeed studios' Grove modules. You can refer to this link for more information. \nWe have been residing in the factory for six months and commit to staying until we start to ship Bittles.    \nSpark Erosion Machining (EDM) for making precise molds\nWe have finished 95% percent of the injection molds of the body frame. The lead time for injection production is one week. More funds are required to make the mold for the optional silicone tail and paws. The lead time is one month. We will provide their 3D printing files if they cannot catch up in time. We are still optimizing the parameters of servos for longer life-span. The lead time is at least two months. NyBoard V1 and battery are production-ready, and the suppliers are waiting for down payments for mass production. The lead time is 45 days to 50 days. We also need to design a sturdy and compact packaging box for international shipping. The lead time is one month. \nProduction schedule\nOpenCat started as the founder Rz Li's pet project in 2016. After the demo video went viral in 2018, he devoted all his time and resources to bring this sophisticated and cute robot to the public. He founded Petoi and successfully crowdfunded the Nybble project in 2018. All the earnings have been put into the fulfillment of Nybble and the R&D of Bittle.\nWe are still fulfilling Nybble orders for a worldwide audience\nOur mission is to bring affordable robotic pets from fiction to reality. We grew from a single maker to a company that can collaborate and negotiate with manufacturers to get the best solutions to our needs. We have many more cool ideas in mind, and Bittle is another small step towards our ideal shape of household robots.\nNybble and Bittle\nYou can help to bring this project to life by backing a wide selection of perks. The main perk for this campaign is the Bittle kit, available from $195 for early bird backers. We will include a free set of wireless dongles for our former Nybble backers.\nBittle kit (the final contents are subject to change)\nBecause there's no shopping cart on Kickstarter to combine your orders, you can refer to the following tables and compare their contents. Pick your base perk, then add the price of your add-on items to your pledge amount during checkout. You will also need to pay the shipping of your base perk during checkout. The extra shipping cost will be covered by us! Make sure you take note of what you ordered! \nTable of perks\nYou can decide your base(composite) perk from the following table, then add extra items according to your needs. \nContents of composite perks\nYou will also need to provide your account ID and payment method to secure your pledge. Kickstarter campaign is an \"all or nothing\" game. Your credit card will only be charged if we can meet the campaign goal during the period. You will receive a survey for your shipping address and other information, such as your preferred color, add-on items, and your Nybble backer ID. \nWe will ship your packages from our Chinese factory with reliable international couriers. Your government will collect the customs tax/fees upon delivery. Note: It can be expensive for some countries and areas. We are very grateful for your support and hope to bring you a unique product ASAP!\nIt has been a fantastic launch! With only a short notice of prelaunch, our initial goal of $50,000 was fulfilled within one day! It is a historical moment for me, for Petoi, and for everyone who loves robotics!\nA brief celebration on the factory's roof\nReaching the original funding goal will help us continue finalizing the R & D of Bittle. We just paid for the mold of silicone tail and paws, and will include them as standard components in the Bittle kit. But we need more funds to pay retainage, prepare for the inventory, break-even, and pay ourselves.\nBody language of \"excitement\"\nPlease shout out to your friends and network that we are setting a STRETCH GOAL at $200,000.  If we meet our stretch goal, we will gift one Grove module in the Bittle kit (even if you didn't back the sensor pack) to encourage you to utilize Bittle's extensible features. Of course, the module should not overlap with the sensor pack. You can browse this list and tell us your favorite. We will pick the most popular one. \nKickstarter is an open platform that reaches different kinds of people with varying interests. Bittle is an open platform to help people realize many dreams in robotics. We have a perfect match in user groups, and the resonance can make our ideas better heard by the world. We are highly interested in your feedback on the design, and how you will train and hack Bittle.\nWe also need your help! We focus so much on Bittle's deliverables that we barely have the budget for ads and marketing. We need your voice to spread out the news to reach more people. The more orders we get, the more leverages we have to negotiate with suppliers for the best quality and production priority. The more users we have, the more fun you get when everyone pitches in and builds applications upon Bittle.\n  Dr. Rongzhong Li (Rz)\nFounder and CEO \nRz is a physics PhD and computer science master. He previously taught computer science at Wake Forest University.\nRz is a maker with broad interests in art, literature, and science. He started the OpenCat project in 2016 and successfully launched Nybble in 2018. Devoted to bringing robotic pets to more people, Bittle is his second gift to the world.\n Lingqing Pi (Len)\nSystem Engineer \nLen has a master's degree in computer communication systems. He has been running various STEM camps over the past five years.\nLen likes to try out new electronic products and excels in remembering their parameters. He designed the variant PCBs and communication modules to make Bittle more extensible and user friendly.\n Kai Mai\nAdvisor \nKai is an alumnus of UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University(CMU).

He helps supervise Petoi's management and development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware products are especially \"hard\" to deliver compared to pure software products. After two years of experience with Nybble, we foresee the following risks and are working hard to mitigate them. \n \n* Supply chain, cash flow, and inventory management\nAny delay in the supply chain could halt production at any stage. We try to solve this by carefully estimating the lead time and divide sequential dependency into parallel processes, and moving the most challenging tasks to our top priority. \n \nNow we need the final push to finalize the designs and make down payments to kick off mass production. However, Kickstarter funding is an \"all or nothing\" game, and the funds will only arrive weeks after the campaign. So we lowered the funding goal a bit to negotiate with our manufacturer earlier during the campaign. They can start to prepare the materials earlier, given our crowdfunding progress. \n\nThis time we include batteries to avoid users' confusion in picking the right ones. However, the production for 2S Li-ion batteries requires an MOQ of 5000 units. It's a sizeable one-time investment, and the storage of many batteries is also risky. We will rent a dedicated room to store the batteries. We will also optimize the production process to reduce the lagging period between stocking and shipping the batteries. \n\n* Certificates and international shipping \nBittle needs to go through several standard tests for importing and exporting certifications. The tests may take up to two months after we send the final products. We took the advice from our experienced manufacturers that the specifications should not be too exceptional. We will reserve Bittle's full dynamic potential to make it a more stable product. \n\nThe breakout of COVID-19 is adding another layer of uncertainty for production and shipping. The factories are subject to close should any case was reported in the area. The international couriers are also having a hard time arranging oversea shipments. There may be a longer wait time between our shipping date and the delivery on your side. \n \nWe will ship Bittles worldwide through international couriers that can provide reliable tracking. Backers will be responsible for paying customs and duties. The amount varies by country or region. We may have a few customers canceling their orders if the fees upon delivery are too high. So we want to make sure everyone knows about the shipping policy before they order. \n\n* Team development\nWe currently have two people working full-time on the project. We managed to push it to the current stage and will scale up the team in time for the massive amount of work towards fulfilling your orders.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe will combine orders and use compact packages to save shipping space and fuel.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Contribute a bittle to open source", "descp": "Every open source project has to struggle to find a way to survive, especially when they have hardware products to deliver.

When time is up, the very side with heavier goods to the balance scale (the side of the balance is lower) wins.\nMagnetic Crane - Transferring Race\n\u2696\ufe0fThe players can use the magnetic crane kit to scramble for the goods in the central area and move them to your own stacking area.\nThe game is over when all the goods are moved out. The very side who moves heavier goods wins.\n\ud83d\ude21Build a 3\u00d74 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes using Armpal robot arm and try to destroy the wooden block wall.\nA total of 3-N rounds are performed according to the number of players (the wooden block wall should be restored after each throw).\n1 point for each block shot, the player with the highest score wins!\n\ud83d\udca3Build a 3\u00d74 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes and try to put them into the Armpal Scale Box controlling the robot arm, 5 throws for each player.\n3 points for Box 1, 10 points for Box 2, and -5 points for accidentally knocking down obstacle blocks.\nThe player with the highest score wins when all the throws are done!\n\ud83c\udfc69 Blocks in the Kick Off Area for each player to carry the wooden blocks to the Scoring Areas within the 3-min game. Successful transportation to the right areas gain points, and the player with the highest score wins when time\u2019s up!\nEach successful placement of a wooden block in the Central Area will get 1 point. The 3-Points Area and 5-Points Area are the Scramble Areas, and the very side with the block at the top of the pile in these areas when time\u2019up will get the corresponding scores.\nWhen players accidentally knock down the wood cubes which are already in the Scramble Areas, corresponding points should be taken from their final scores.\n\ud83e\udd1dTwo people operate a device (each person with one of the 2 handles) simultaneously , each group of players transports wooden blocks from the Stacking Area to the Central Area within the 3-min game, and the group with more wooden blocks wins when time\u2019s up.\n\ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1bPlayers will pass the wooden blocks in a circle controlling their Armpals.\nWatch out! Don\u2019t drop it!\nThe 2 players who dropped the wooden block while passing it will fail the game and the other 2 players win!\n The new Cannon Kit emphasizes the sense of simulation like the existing kit, so it will have a firing principle that is completely different from other firearm model toys \u2014\u2014 this might probably the closest one to real ammunition in the current market!\nFor the new cannon kit, we designed ammunition containing bullet, case, primer, and even powder (replaced by spring energy storage). At the same time, we designed the components for delivery and return. And also, a series of institutions of shelling (throwing shells).\nIn addition to controlling the aiming of the robotic arm during operation, you will also use the two triggers on the handle of the control unit, one of which is used to fire and the other is used to deliver the bomb. 5 Rounds of ammunition can be loaded at once. \n *The Cannon Kit is currently undergoing verification and finishing work, will be available for purchase at special price for ALL BACKERS ON KICKSTARTER on pledge manager when the campaign ends. \nArmpal is a set of wooden assembled, non plug-in tabletop game.\nReducing the difficulty of the assembly process to the lowest level, the most complicated tool you\u2019ll use is only a screwdriver, which make ArmPal well-adapted to a very wide age range.\nWe have designed a multi-axis operating system for Armpal that is beyond imagination. \nYou can easily use your hands to cooperate with the manipulation machinery to complete complex operations.\nIf you want to experience the joy of manipulating machinery without leaving home, this set of tabletop game must be a very good choice.\nAs a set of mechanical-themed tabletop game, you can find armpal ingeniously integrates gear transmission, hydraulic transmission, pulleys, magnets, and multiple mechanisms. \nThe visualized design enable us to enjoy the whole working process of movements with all the beautiful mechanical structures.  \n\nThe optimization of the production process is also an important part of the design work.\nThe laser cutting of the main wood knot structure can ensure smooth edges, and makes it easy to be taken apart without tools.\nFor better gaming experience and longer life of the mechanical structure, we\u2019ve done a lot of work. Besides the strengthened structure and decreased wear and tear, special windows were designed to maintain the hydraulic transmission system with simple steps.\nIn just a few steps, the entire hydraulic system can be rejuvenated to counteract possible liquid evaporation.\n Our designers try to assign hand-made models to the attributes of the game. Such products can bring people back to the real world from mobile phones and the Internet, increasing face-to-face communication between people.\nThe time spent playing with family or friends is full of happiness. And what is even more amazing is that this game is made by yourselves!\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nCrossprom.com lets you find matching cross-promotion friendly campaigns, streamline partnerships, follow schedules and mentions, retarget your visitors, and increase your conversions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur design team has a rich product experience.

You need a simple cutting edge, but there\u2019s none within easy reach. We designed Dagr specifically for that situation, to be the knife that\u2019s always with you wherever you go. It\u2019s compact enough to ride along amongst your keys, but sharp enough to help with your everyday cutting tasks.\nDagr is engineered to protect it's blade when not in use with a tightly-threaded protective cap. When closed, it can be easily attached to your key ring, carabiner or shock cord \u2013 what ever carrying method you prefer. When needed, it can be unscrewed from its cap and either used alone for maximum flexibility or be re-attached to the cap to create a longer, more substantial grip area if needed.\nWhen not in use as a knife, Dagr is an always ready, non-contact tool for use in public spaces, activating elevator buttons, light switches, gas pumps and ATM\u2019s.  Both Stainless and Titanium are easily disinfected when needed.\nDagr\u2019s blade and cap parts are each CNC turned from solid 304 stainless steel or grade 5 Titanium stock. 304 Stainless is a preferred grade for use in the production of surgical instruments, Grade 5 Titanium is a favorite of the aircraft industry for its additional strength and lighter weight. Both are ideal materials for the job, will last forever.\nRegardless of size, knives are all about blade sharpness and the ability to cut stuff when needed. Dagr\u2019s blade is .5\u201d (12mm) long and .07\" ( 2mm) thick, allowing it to be used both for paper-thin materials and heftier, thicker materials like cardboard, leather or even twine & lanyard cord. TSA does not allow any sharp objects on planes, but Dagr can be places in checked luggage. Details can be found here! \nDagr's permanent blade can be easily re-sharpened with any whetstone, providing many years of service.\nOur shop is ready to begin production as soon as the project ends and can produce several hundred Dagrs per week. Though we will begin shipping as soon as parts are complete, we setting August as our target to begin shipping, and shipments will continue as parts arrive.\nOur worldwide shipping method will be by US Post. We've had a very high success rate with USPS on our past projects, but please note that we will not be able to track shipments beyond the US border. We'd be happy to make alternative shipping arrangements with tracking at an additional cost if you require - just let us know.\nBy supporting this project you will not only receive an AWESOME knife, but you will be helping to keep a small community of independent shops (including ours!) up and running in these challenging times. Our future success as creators here on Kickstarter depends on making sure our local independent shop ecosystem is able to pull through this shut down. It\u2019s a good cause and we all appreciate of your support!\nFor those of you new to our projects, our name 'Onehundred' comes from the 100 mile radius around our Saxonville, MA studio where we seek out talented New England manufacturers, many are 50+ year old independent shops. Manufacturing locally not only insures quality and helps maintain a stable manufacturing community, it also lowers our carbon footprint by about 60% by not having to ship materials or finished parts around the world.\nLearn more: onehundred.co", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working with all of our local production partners for several years now. They do quality work and being that they are close by, we're able to visit them often to resolve any issues if they arise. The biggest risk to beginning shipping on the stated date, though, is their production capacity and scheduling of other work at the time of our actual order. \n\nOccasionally, our smaller production runs may be delayed in favor of larger orders - a variable we can't always control. We never know in advance how many pieces we'll need to produce or if our shops will have an opening for our project when we are ready for production. Additionally, the manufacturing world is in considerable flux at the moment. Though our preferred shop is excited about working on our project and a revery capable at what they do, we can\u2019t be 100% certain they will be able to complete the work when the time comes.\n\nFor those of you who are new to our projects, we have a lot of product development, manufacturing & crowdfunding delivery experience. We love working with our crowdfunding community, communicate often and take good care of our backers. This is our 22nd crowdfunding campaign and we're looking forward to many more!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nStainless steel & titanium are both tough, high-quality metals that will provide decades of cutting performance.\nReusability and recyclability\nNo longer able to find a use for your Dagr?

For many this product was intended as a gift for the holiday season, and it is entirely within reason for you to have expected it to arrive at that time. Under normal circumstances it is a challenge enough coordinating manufacturers, suppliers, and the like to meet a deadline - moreso when your business consists of one person managing it all. We don\u2019t have the capabilities of a big company. With the complexities of the events of this past year, with shutdowns and closures, getting everything to meet a schedule has been more strenuous than usual. Add on top of that the life-altering side effects of chemotherapy and several operations - my dad was doing the best he could in his situation. I cannot speak for the full scope of all that went on - this past year has quite simply been a mess of circumstances that have tested our patience. My dad had every intent to deliver this before the holidays, and did what he could to meet that promise. Of the many factors that dragged this out so late - I assure you none of which were intentional. It has all been at the whim of circumstances, of which neither he nor I had the ability to speed up.

The same could be done on these models by having concave pips hidden on the inside part of the shell to match the side of the die that is supposed to face that side. While I\u2019m sure many in the 3D printing hobby will just design this stuff on their own, the GoDice company would certainly put a smile on many people faces by not only having the open API, but also providing open source for d6 models that developers and players can use to add their custom d6s into the app. I don\u2019t think other size dice shell models should be open source, but I do think it would be a good idea to do this for d6 as it would open the door to many more developers to use the dice and expand the market.", "time": "over 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Jason Yarbrough", "content": "@Justin: The point of this is that the dice do tell what is physically rolled.

Getting touch right in the design of objects and products is essential \u2013 this is where the Trill sensors come in.\nThe Trill sensors use capacitive sensing to precisely track finger movements, making it quick and easy to create beautifully responsive new touch interfaces. \nTrill is brought to you by the team behind Bela, the open-source maker platform for working with audio and sensors. With this Kickstarter we want to bring rapid touch prototyping to makers, product designers, interactive artists, instrument builders and synth experimenters around the world.\n\nWe are launching t\u0336h\u0336r\u0336e\u0336e\u0336 five types of sensor (see our Stretch Goals below): \n TRILL BAR, a slider that can sense up to five touch points \n TRILL SQUARE, a touch pad that senses two axes of movement\n TRILL CRAFT,  a 30-channel breakout board that lets you make your own touch interfaces out of anything conductive\nSee the stretch goals section below for TRILL HEX and TRILL RING.\nTrill connects to lots of things\nWorking with Trill is easy. Trill sensors use an I2C connection which means they can be connected to a variety of popular maker boards.  We include a library and examples for Bela, Arduino and Raspberry Pi that give you everything you need to get started. \n\nCreate sophisticated interfaces\nEach sensor has a configurable I2C address that can be set via solder bridges on the back so you can connect multiple Trill sensors together and create complex touch interfaces. Sensing through thin surfaces like vinyl is also possible, allowing you to embed and hide the sensors within your custom interface.\n\nCut sensors to size\nYou can also cut the sensors down to size if you have a specific application that requires a different shape sensor. \n\nTurn anything into a sensor\nTRILL CRAFT allows you to turn anything that conducts electricity into a sensor: you can make sliders or buttons out of copper tape, conductive paint, e-textiles and many other materials such as water, metals and even fruit.\n\nTrill sensors can be used to create all kinds of wonderful interactive devices and interfaces. Over the course of the Kickstarter campaign we will be releasing detailed posts and tutorials that explain how each of these projects were built \u2013 stay tuned!\n\n Sonic Circuit Sculpture by Helen Leigh \nHelen Leigh has created a family of sonic circuit sculptures that use Trill Craft in combination with Bela Mini to create a beautiful series of interactive sound installations. Read more about this project on our blog: https://blog.bela.io/2019/09/19/trill-helen-leigh-craft-circuit-sculpture/\n\n Euro-Trill Modular Synth\nThe Trill sensors are the perfect tools for building synthesisers and electronic musical instruments. At Bela we have created a number of instruments with these sensors already. Below is a modular synth that we created with all three types of Trill sensor and our DIY Eurorack module Pepper.  Read more about this project on our blog: https://blog.bela.io/2019/09/27/euro-trill-modular-eurorack/\n\nVisualising Trill sensors in the Bela IDE\nThe Trill sensors ship with libraries and examples for a variety of popular maker boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but the perfect partner for the Trill sensors is our own maker platform, Bela. \n\nGranulator with Trill Bar and Trill Square\nBrass instrument with Trill Craft\n\nTrill sensors are designed by the team behind Bela, the open-source maker platform for ultra-low latency audio and sensors. Like Bela, the Trill sensors are open-source hardware letting you edit and remix our designs.\nBela launched on Kickstarter in 2016, and empowers makers, designers and musicians to create beautifully responsive instruments and other interactive projects. Our speciality is music: we understand the specific demands of musicians, and we design high quality products that work for them but are also perfect for many other types of product design and making.\n\nTrill sensors use capacitive sensing to track finger position responsively and with high resolution. Each sensor features a microcontroller containing high-resolution analog hardware and custom firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have now (10th October) unlocked our first two stretch goals, Trill Hex and Trill Ring.\nBackers are now able to choose from five Trill sensors for their rewards: Trill Bar, Square, Craft, Hex or Ring (we'll send you a survey after the campaign to get your choices).\nTrill Hex has now been reached as a stretch goal and backers will be able to additionally choose this sensor at the end of the campaign! Trill Hex is a hexagonal, 2-axis x/y sensor. Perfect for tessellation. Trill Hex will make building complex touch interfaces like isomorphic keyboards easier than ever before.\n\n Trill Ring, a one-axis circular slider that can also detect up to 5 simultaneous touches. Perfect for controlling volume, filters and more. This stretch goal was unlocked at \u00a318k.\n\nAlready a backer? Don't worry, you don't need to choose your rewards now - we'll send you a survey when the campaign ends to get your final choices. In the meantime, you can increase your pledge at any time to take advantage of these additional options as they become available (\u00a311-\u00a314 per sensor depending on your reward, check your reward for details).\nTrill comes from the creators of Bela, the open source maker platform for audio and sensor processing, and TouchKeys, which brings expressive multi-touch sensing to the piano keyboard. Both projects were launched with successful Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nBela launched on Kickstarter in 2016 and now sells boards worldwide\nBela empowers makers, designers, artists and musicians to create beautifully responsive interactive systems\nGlobal community of makers in the thousands sharing projects on blog.bela.io \nIntuitive toolchain for creating complex interactive sound projects\n\n  TouchKeys launched on Kickstarter in 2013 \nSells finished keyboards and DIY overlays at http://touchkeys.co.uk/ \nCapacitive touch overlay for any piano keyboard     \n\n\nAll of our activities as a company are about supporting makers and giving them the best creative tools to work with. As a group we understand musicians' needs intimately and make high quality products that can meet their demanding requirements.\nKickstarter is our platform of choice for launching new products \u2013 we know it well and believe it is the ideal way to reach out to our community and the wider world of makers before bringing a product to the market.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are an experienced team that has successfully delivered on two Kickstarter campaigns (Bela Platform 2016 and TouchKeys 2013). We have a proven track record of delivering our rewards in a timely manner and are confident we can do the same with this campaign. Within our team we have extensive experience in hardware and software development as well as existing relationships with trusted manufacturers and part suppliers. \n\nThe final hardware designs of the Trill sensors have been thoroughly tested going out to numerous beta testers in the last few months who have helped to iron out any issues in the design and software support. This means that we are ready to go into production as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nAs with any hardware project, delays could occur due to disruption further up the supply chain.

Join our Discord, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. \nIf you have questions you can mail us at: support@bugbyte.fi\nWe cannot thank each of you enough for having backed us and given us your trust. We don't take that for granted and we're here to create a great game for you to the best of our abilities. \nWhat follows is the original Kickstarter campaign description. Finished Kickstarter projects cannot be edited, so this information will fall out of date over time. For the latest, go to: http://bugbyte.fi/spacehaven \nEmbark on a space voyage with your ragtag crew of civilians in search of a new home. Build spaceships tile by tile, create optimal gas conditions, manage the needs and moods of their crew, encounter other space-faring groups, and explore the universe in this spaceship colony sim for Windows, Mac, Linux.\nSpace Haven combines the emergent story telling components of RimWorld with a tile-based gas-simulation system seen in Oxygen Not Included.\nSurvive your own way. Choose to act like a pirate, slave trader, alien hunter or a force for good.\nWant to be a pirate and attack and steal from anyone you meet? Maybe you want to be a slave trader and capture crew members from other factions and sell them on the market? You could be a notorious alien hunter, fighting aliens aboard derelict ships and scavenging their meat. Or perhaps you're the good guy fighting pirates and helping civilians? Space Haven aims to give you the freedom to role play.\nSpace Haven allows for complete freedom regarding building.\n Customize - Complete freedom to build a spaceship or station of your own desire. Place every piece of ship hull, wall, door and facility wherever you want. \n Functional - All facilities serve a purpose. Crew members will sleep in beds, use toilets, be disturbed by a noisy room and praise you for an arcade machine.\nA functional spaceship can be built tile-by tile, giving you the opportunity to shape a spaceship of your own desire. It can be symmetric and streamlined, or an asymmetrical whimsical looking thing. It does not have to look like a conventional spaceship depicted in sci-fi literature, you are free to design your own, the choice is yours!\nTile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship.\n Oxygen and CO2 - Keep optimal Oxygen and CO2 levels by building life support modules for your crew members.\n Hazardous gases - Certain facilities and explosions can release hazardous gases. Build scrubbers to purify the air.\n Temperature and power - Build thermal regulators to maintain an ideal temperature for your crew. Build power nodes and set up power distribution throughout the ship.\n Comfort - Building a bed right next to the ship core will disturb sleep. Design your ship for crew comfort.\nThe isometric tile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship. Humans, plants and facilities react to the conditions surrounding them, giving meaning to how you design your ship and the living conditions you create. Secure facilities, optimize crew survival and well-being, but also think of possible future accidents and chaos generated from crew combat or environmental hazards. \nThe game simulates needs, moods, health and relationships of crew members.\n Skills and traits - Every crew member has their own set of skills and traits. A wimp might get scared shooting a gun, while an iron-stomach can eat anything unaffected.\n Mood - A happy crew member needs food, sleep, comfort, safety and friends. Take something away and their mood will be affected. \n Conditions - Crew members might feel adventurous, suffer from starvation, feel unhygienic, or they simply ate too much. Various conditions affect how they feel. \n Mental breaks - When the stress is too much for a crew member they may suffer a mental break. Some will vent themselves out of the air lock, while others might start a fight.\nIn Space Haven characters aren't mere robots. The game simulates needs, moods, health and skills of your crew members and they develop relationships with each other. Their past life occupation and hobbies will affect their skills and know-how, and they have both positive and negative traits. Witness joyful moments, depression, and drama surrounding different crew members as you journey onward seeking a new home. \nOrganize away teams to explore derelict ships and visit other faction ships.\n Away missions - Equip your crew members and organize away teams to explore derelict ships or visit stations or spaceships of other factions. \n Draft - Draft and move your crew members to attack enemies and save their friends.\n Inventory - Each crew member has their own unique inventory. Equip them with pistols, rifles, grenades and more.\nEquip your crew with space suits and weapons and organize away teams to explore derelict ships and stations. Explore and salvage resources and items; find activated cryopods with someone frozen inside. Visit spaceships or stations of other factions and find data logs telling stories of past spacefarers searching for a new home. \nAliens try to capture your crew members alive.\n Crew combat - Engage in combat with enemy factions or an alien species. \n Aliens - Watch aliens incapacitate your crew members and capture them alive. See them suffer in the alien lair and decide if you want to try to save them or not.\nAliens capture your crew members and cocoon them against walls in their base. See them suffer in the alien lair and decide if you want to save them or not. Explore derelict ships and discover someone from the original crew of the ship captured by the aliens. Events like these create interesting back stories to new arrivals to your crew.\nEngage in ship-to-ship combat, where a hit can snowball into a disastrous event for your crew.\n Battlestations - Watch your crew take battlestations as you engage the enemy in ship-to-ship battle. See your crew load turrets with projectiles, put out fires from explosions, patch hull breaches and repair vital facilities in the midst of battle.\n Tactical - Target the enemy ship engine and stop them from fleeing. See them do the same to you. Engage their turrets directly or try to focus on the enemy ship core and see their ship go pitch black. Build shields to protect your most vital segments of your ships.\nBuild turrets and engage in tactical ship-to-ship combat, where a hit and explosion could cause a snowball effect of fire, smoke, hazardous gases and even hull breaches for either party. All crew members need to work together to win the battle.\nTreat crew member for injuries, diseases and other medical conditions.\n Cryopods - Protect your crew from side-effects of Inter-stellar travel. Place crew members into stasis to freeze the progression of a disease or to await rescue. \n Medical - Treat crew members for injuries, wounds and diseases. Medical conditions affect crew members in various ways.\nYour crew members will become wounded in battles and might catch a serious disease. Set up a medical room, scan for diseases and foreign masses and have your best doctor tend to illnesses and perform surgeries. Hope that your doctor is not absent minded and leaves a surgical tool inside.\nExplore a new procedurally generated galaxy each playthrough.\n Generated galaxy - Explore a new procedurally generated galaxy each playthrough, with planets, asteroids, stations and spaceships of other factions.\n Factions - Interact with various factions all trying to survive and establish dominance their own way. Meet pirates, merchants, slave traders, cultists and more and develop relationships with each. \n Resources - Mine for raw resources and refine them to building materials. Trade resources with other groups you meet.\nExplore a new procedurally generated galaxy each new playthrough, with various factions all trying to survive and establish dominance their own way. You'll meet pirates, slavers, merchants, cults, androids and more. Jump into hyperspace, seek out resources and meet various groups and develop your relationship with them.\n  Type: Single player\n  Genre: Indie, Simulation, Strategy\n  Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux\n  Release dates: Kickstarter Alpha (April 2019), Steam Early Access (Q4 2019), Full Launch (2020)\nWe're taking this seriously. We're not going to put the game on Steam, even as early access, before we have iteratively developed the game to be ready for that. You, our Kickstarter backers, will help us get the game to that point by providing us invaluable feedback as we progress. \nJoin the alpha crew and help us create something beautiful! You will get access to the game once this campaign has ended and Kickstarter has sent us the backer data. \nWe've worked hard for three years to create the architecture of the game, giving us a solid base to build upon. Now it's time to start adding much needed content. As a Kickstarter backer, you'll be able to give us feedback regarding which direction we take the game. Below are a few of our thoughts.\nNote that this list of modules isn't a roadmap and may not all ever be finished. We will do our best to implement as much as possible.\n Role play elements - Expand on game elements allowing you to role play, giving you the ability to butcher aliens for meat, sell your crew members for credits and attack and steal from anyone you see. Role play as a pirate, slave trader, alien hunter, merchant or other.\n Faction relations - Create more depth to factions, their back stories and how they relate to each other.\n Environmental storytelling - Create an environmental story generation tool. Explore ships and stations and find Androids, who overpowered their masters, medical bays filled with corpses, open alien eggs on a research bench with dead crew members around.\n Deep characterization - Improve character interactions, relationships, conditions, traits and diseases to give more depth to your crew members.\n Research - Create a research tree, with new technology to unlock. Research new weapons, shields and facilities.\n Health modeling - Medical beds would have a scanning mechanism. Scan for diseases and foreign masses. Have your doctor perform surgeries and tend to the sick.\n Crew combat - Improve on the mechanics of crew combat.\n Ship-to-ship battle - Implement and improve on the mechanics of ship-to-ship battle.\n Game customization - New game modes, like a sandbox mode or building space stations instead of spaceships. If something annoys you turn it off. Customize your game regarding game difficulty, faction presence and so on.\n Multiple endings - Create more than one way to finish a playthrough, tied to stories. Endless sandbox possibility.\n Modding - Mod support can allow the player base to implement interesting, or experimental ideas of their own, allowing for a richer gaming experience. \n Landing on Planets - This would be a big task, and would require a lot of time. It is something we dream of though. With enough funding we could give it a serious thought.\n Your wishes -  Anything the community thinks up is on the table. We will listen and implement to our best judgement.\nWhile playing, you'll be listening to amazing emotional tracks developed  by Paul Zimmermann. We are very happy to work with someone who can create exactly what we needed to realize our vision for Space Haven's sound. Paul is developing both the music and the sound effects for Space Haven. The beautiful lyrics and vocals are by Scalefin. \nSpace Haven tells your story through emergent gameplay, but others left their mark among the stars as well. Their stories are told by recovered data. Unearth the voyages of other ships and crews through recovered tablets, phones and logs taken from dead humans aboard the derelict ships and stations you encounter, and follow in your predecessor\u2019s footsteps as they lead you toward the game\u2019s many endings.\nThese logs and other background story details are provided by Philip R. Johnson, also known as HamboneHFY, author and creator of the popular Sci-Fi web serial The Deathworlders. \nAll community goals have been met!

We were already practicing it in India, during the Vedic period, 2 thousand years before Jesus Christ. Etruscan and roman citizens, Arabic countries and Spanish people loved to play with faith with those six faces. One of them was a flower drawn (\u01cez-z\u01cehr, in ancient Arab) and, in latin, dice, the dice\u2019s game, and hazard, were designated with the word \u00ab Alea \u00bb. As old as the world, the dice game has not much evolved since. But it was used for a lot of goals.

That wasn\u2019t the case, we struggled to improve it in a better way, but : \n                - It took really more time than expected and many iterations;\n                - Thus it costed us more than expected before (I remind you that we did not pay ourselves but just our subcontractors).\n                - We also improved the apps and games concepts. And to not burn more and more money that we would need to produce, we went forward by developing firstly with internships (slower and cheaper\u2026).\n                - We also improved the docking station and the dice itself (you can see the minor costs for that).\n\n3) Considering the treasury, we started to reach out business angels, public subsidies, etc. which ones were interested by investing in Dicees. But unfortunately, the crisis brought negotiations to a halt. We are softly restarting to talk to potential investors.\nBy the way, some of you are talking about the project value estimation for a potential investor, I\u2019m not sure that you take all the time, the investment, the market potential, the IP, and so on into account to pretend that nobody would invest that much money in Dicees. Companies value estimations are not that simple. That was a completely mistaken intuition, just to rub salt in the wound.

Robots are NOW and you can make them. Robot vacuums, companion robots & UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)/ autonomous drones have grown in popularity and will soon become an integral part of your life. Be a part of building the future by joining the Maker Community! \nFor autonomous robots, a core technology is LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging Sensor). Ever wonder how a robot can see? How does a robot vacuum avoid walls? How does a self-driving car sense traffic or pedestrians? The answer is LiDAR, a scanning technology that maps objects or space by illuminating the target with a pulsed laser light. \niLidar is the first solid-state LiDAR sensor made for ALL MAKERS from beginner to robotics developers. Overcoming the limitations of traditional LiDAR, iLidar offers cutting-edge LiDAR performance at an unbeatable price, all in one compact sensor module.\nAs Seen On\nInteresting Engineering | Geeky Gadgets | hackster | engineering.com | Connetcted Crib | Brainiacs from Mars | Robotis Gizmos | Trend Hunter | World IT Show | Maker Faire Seoul 2018\n1D LiDAR \nUtilizing a point laser, 1D LiDAR sensors are only capable of measuring distance to one point. While cheap and compact, their use functionality is limited.\n2D LiDAR\n2D LiDAR allows for basic scanning of space. To scan in 2D, most LiDAR sensors require rotation to sense distance on a line across space. \niLidar \nUtilizing line laser technology, iLidar is capable of 2D mapping without requiring rotation. To scan a space in true 3D, iLidar simply needs to scan on the vertical axis. \nIn the video below, you can view iLidar\u2019s performance. Through innovation in short-range LiDAR performance, iLidar provides unparalleled performance cost.\n For more detail information, please download iLidar datasheet.\n iLidar Configurator \nDon't bothered by initial sensor configuration work on your embedded platforms. Plug iLidar into your PC and configure it as you want. Configuration data can be saved into iLidar's non-volatile memory section, and will be loaded at each power-up afterward. Real-time data visualization is also possible with iLidar Configurator. See what iLidar sees.\nOpen Software Development Kit : C/C++  \nHave complete access to iLidar\u2019s open source SDK (software development kit). Plug & play by configuring iLidar with a variety of embedded micro controllers including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or Jetson.\nThe Hybo team was formed as the robotics club at Pohang University of Science & Technology(POSTECH). As makers ourselves, one of the biggest frustrations was the inaccessibility of a quality, affordable LiDAR sensor. Finally, we decided why not make one ourselves?\niLidar was created for makers by makers. Affordable, versatile and compact, iLidar makes LiDAR technology accessible to everyone. We continue to be heavily involved in the maker community including participating in the Maker Fair and cannot wait to hear about how you integrate iLidar into your creations!\nWhy are we on Kickstarter?\nAll funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards: \n1.

I put the scroll out before sun up, starting with the charge indicator (my term by the way- SOUL hasn\u2019t provided any info regarding these blue LEDS) showing two blue LEDs lit. I left the scroll in the bright sun ALL DAY until dark. Sunrise about 6:30 and sunset about 8:30, which works out to about 14 hours of sunlight reaching the scroll. After this all day charge I gained ONE single extra LED on the charge indicator. I started with two lit out of five and at the end of the day three were lit. So it does appear to be charging, but VERY VERY slowly. This 14 hour solar charge for one fifth of a charge is VERY different than the specs that were given on the Kickstarter page for the scroll, as well as the SOUL web site which states a full charge can be achieved in 4-6 hours of bright sun. 14 hours in the sun for one fifth of a charge isn\u2019t even in the same ballpark. Charging this slow makes this unit nearly useless. Without any meaningful reply or email from SOUL , who knows if my unit is faulty or not.

Controlled via an intuitive app, web account or voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Alexa, Canvia makes it easy to find art to suit changing tastes, keep you inspired and enliven your surroundings.\nWhy Did We Create Canvia?\nJust as Spotify has revolutionized the accessibility, exploration and experience of recorded music, and services like Netflix have done the same for vast archives of film and TV, we want Canvia to revolutionize the accessibility and experience of art. \nIn order to achieve this though, we realized it wasn't only a question of content - we also needed to create a device and platform that:    \nlooks and feels like authentic physical art (i.e. a painting or print), conserving realistic details such as color, texture and brushstrokes\naugments the experience of art with key information and helpful guidance, avoiding any of the intimidating bars to entry of the art world, auctions and gallery system\nand is connected, interactive, sharable as an experience and - most importantly - flexible for people's changing needs and spaces.\nIn this way, Canvia solves problems with the 'traditional' approach to sourcing and buying art:\nHow Does Canvia Work? \nPLAY\n\nCanvia is driven by Palacio\u2019s proprietary (patent-pending) ArtSense technology that simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, whatever the environment.\nBuilt-in sensors read ambient visual conditions and this data is used to actively adapt the displayed image. The light-emitting screen therefore appears solely light-reflective, as with physical art, and ensures all images retain a realistic painting or print-like quality (conserving details like texture, color and individual brushstrokes) under any conditions.\nArtSense technology simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, conserving details such as texture, colors and even individual brushstrokes\nArtSense also enables art selections that better suit an environment and context. In this way, Canvia offers a more realistic and harmonious art viewing experience than any computer monitor or TV; so real, in fact, that it\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between Canvia and physical art. \nDon\u2019t Just Take Our Word For It\u2026\nPLAY\n\nWith Canvia, seeing is believing. If you want to check it out for yourself, request a timeslot for a live demo or video stream at outreach@palacio.life.  \nYou can also find out more on our website, Twitter and Instagram.\nStretch Goals\nThe Art Library\nCanvia is linked to a huge online library that includes artworks from all genres, eras, cultures and media (including photography), offering choices to suit any mood, occasion, context and d\u00e9cor.\nNeed something relaxing for a late-night study session? You can schedule one of Monet's calming waterlily paintings. Friends over for the big game? Go for a George Bellows from one of our 'Sports' themed playlists. Throwing a house party? We've got an explosive Kandinsky or energetic Degas cabaret scene for that.  \nWe\u2019ll be offering two subscription tiers for Canvia: a \u2018free\u2019 tier that currently has over 3,000 works (and is growing everyday), from Old Masters to Modern and Contemporary art, and a paid-for \u2018premium\u2019 tier of famous and upcoming current artists, illustrators and photographers.\nAll artwork is carefully curated and organized into themed playlists (for both vertical and horizontal orientations), or users can create their own. \nOur recommendation engine also helps you find works matching your d\u00e9cor and preferences, and all playlists can be scheduled for specific times of day.\nArtist Engagement \nCanvia is about sharing great art. We\u2019re building up a network of contributing partners - individual artists and photographers, galleries, museums and colleges - to ensure we offer the best art in the world. \nSince starting our outreach activities in March, we've partnered with over one hundred professional artists from across the globe and the list is growing every day. We recognize the great effort of creating art and so contributing artists will receive a share of our revenues.\nIf you're an artist and would like to apply to our library, please contact outreach@palacio.life.\nDevice Features & Specs\nUsers can schedule their own playlists and upload personal images via the app (iOS or Android), web account, USB or MicroSD. Information about an artwork and artist can be added as an overlay, and the entire artwork can be explored through zoom and repositioning functionality within the app.\nVoice integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant will be supported, although may not be available with the first firmware/software launch.\nAll works submitted by artists will reside in a closed system, which includes Canvia's secure cloud library, device and app. This will ensure the digital reproductions of artists' work cannot be misappropriated.\nCanvia\u2019s innovative patent-pending design allows customers to select variable frame/mat board widths, wood type and color, offering even more options to match your d\u00e9cor and creative preferences.  \nBlack, cherry, wood and white frame colors will be available for launch; black as standard and the other colors for an additional cost of $25. In order to upgrade your pledges, please follow these instructions:\nNote that the final mass-produced frame might have slightly different dimensions from the current pre-production prototypes due to manufacturing constraints. We will inform backers of any changes.\nHinges at the back allow you to pivot the device and access communication ports for USB and MicroSD uploads while Canvia is still mounted to the wall.\nCanvia automatically detects the orientation and loads compatible playlists.\nVESA mount compatibility affords greater mobility and control.\nWe also have a load of additional features that will be revealed in due course, all geared towards further enhancing the art experience - watch this space!\nThe Team  \nThe team at Palacio brings deep industry experience across connected devices, IOT, cloud technologies and video & image processing, as well as art curation, art direction, advertising and media production.  \nThis confluence of technology and creative thinking drives our innovation and reflects our ultimate goal with Canvia: to combine cutting-edge technical design with an artistic sensibility to create an entirely new way of enhancing and experiencing art in our living spaces.\nWhy we need your help\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year and a half developing, user testing and improving Canvia. We come to Kickstarter with a near 100% pre-production prototype.\n\nWe're now looking for your help to revolutionize the art experience. We can't wait to bring Canvia into homes, offices, restaurants and other living spaces and open up art to the world. \n\nSpecifically, our Kickstarter campaign will help to fund: \nCompleting mold designs for the mat board and chassis \nCompleting an initial mass production and manufacturing run of our first Canvia model\nRegulatory (FCC and CE) certification\nPackaging \nFeedback! Even if you don\u2019t want to buy Canvia, we\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on our product and approach. You can contact us via the Comments section on this page or outreach@palacio.life.  \nTimelines\nCanvia is designed and assembled in USA.\n30-day money back guarantee\nWe also appreciate that most backers will not be able to experience Canvia first-hand before pledging. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll love our product but as a reward for your faith we\u2019re offering a 30-day money back guarantee: if you don\u2019t like Canvia, you can return our device for a full refund within 30 days of shipment.\nContact\nWe look forward to hearing your thoughts. You can get in touch via the Kickstarter community board or any of the following:\n                                                                                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re working with leading global manufacturing partners with a proven track record in technology and devices.

In other words the same thin, silver coloured and IMO rather discreet tension wire (with or without clear coating), that I'll be using to physically hang the screen, can also be used to route power to it. Only need to split the DC power supplied by the included adapter in a hidden location, run the power down the tension wire and then join the two electrodes back together behind the screen, to whatever connector is required, hopefully a standard barrel connector. To work out the thinnest suitable gauge, what voltage and current or resulting power does Canvia require? I'm guess probably 12-19V and no more than 60W (hopefully less).

Thereafter, production testing and external certification testing will be undertaken to ensure that the Mu One behaves exactly as we expect.\nThen\u2026 (drum roll) it\u2019s \u2018show time\u2019 as we start mass production of the shiny new Mu One and gear up for shipping towards the end of the summer.\nHere's a first look at our initial prototyping of the Mu One in the meantime...\nOur Story\nA few years ago two Dudes wrestled with a sketch.\nA sketch that was about to have life forced upon it.\nIt was the start of a heroic British start-up story. A story that was solving a long overlooked problem of the size of the humble UK plug.\nHaving been unchanged for over 50 years the UK plug was outdated and outsized in comparison to the mobile devices that it served. That changed as the sketch became the Mu and the UK plug size was solved forever.\nThe Mu won Design of the Year, Accessory of Mobile World Congress along with other associated high profile awards for its novel and simplistic form factor.\nBut in reality, the job was only half done.\nUnder the hood, the unseen secondary challenge of the Mu related to the power that it provides. In its first manifestation the \u2018Mu Classic\u2019, the Mu had an output power of 1Amp\u200a\u2014\u200ajust enough to charge a smartphone. Later, the \u2018Mu Tablet\u2019, \u2018Mu Duo\u2019 and \u2018Mu International\u2019 increased the power to 2.4Amp\u200a\u2014\u200anow smartphone and tablet ready. But the enemy of increasing the power of the Mu had two faces: the size of the components on the electronics board inside the Mu that were generally linear to its output, and the heat that it produced. The Mu, being super small, had a very limited enclosure to fit power and to disperse and heat. The impact that the Mu could have over a full range of mobile devices was limited by its essence\u200a\u2014\u200asize.\nFor the last two years, the small team behind the Mu have been working with the major global semi-conductor companies aligning their design to the ultimate pursuit of these goliath power providers\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh power density (lots of output in a small space) and high efficiency (low heat loss).\nAnd the results are in\u2026\nThe Mu One hosts 45W output power, now enough to power the latest notebooks and Macbooks. It hosts Power Delivery Technology that creates a variable voltage for fast charging devices, and it has an auto detect chip on board that creates an optimum charge for iOS, Android and other makes of mobile devices. All of this inside the svelte 14mm profile of the Mu.\nBeing able to add over four times the power of its predecessor is a result of the birth of Gallium Nitride Technology (GaN) enabling a huge amount of power to be enclosed in a very small space\u200a\u2014\u200aall whilst running at a market leading efficiency of over 90%.\nFinally, the solution to create the ultimate Mu is available.\nTechnology has finally caught up with the Mu that those two Dudes always wanted to produce.\nTwo Dudes\n   This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur small design team first successfully launched our UK version of the Mu in 2012.\n\nSince then we've established fantastic manufacturing partnerships allowing us to design and build a Mu family.\n\nThis will be our third big product release since launching the original Mu USB charger in 2012, and this time around we have been working with a specialist technology partner to deliver an extraordinary small and powerful product. The Mu One combines their expertise, our design skills and the superb production capabilities of our manufacturing partners.\n\nAll of these are in place and prototypes have been made so we just need to lock down those prototypes, push into production, create some tooling and stir in a little magic. \n\nSaying that, we've done this before and we know that nothing is plain sailing but we've built in some contingency time into our production schedule to allow for the inevitable 'item' that we can't foresee at the moment. We're confident that the pursuit of creating magic will overcome that unknown 'item'. And we've been here long enough to know that we'll be handling both during and after this campaign.\n\nNow, it's magic time!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "Mu One", "descp": "The Mu One | The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Fast Charger\n(saving >22% versus RRP)\nINCLUDES:\nThe Mu One - The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Charger\nFree UK & US Shipping", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["454 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "Mu One + Premium Type-C Cable", "descp": "The Mu One | The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Fast Charger + Native Union Premium Type-C to C Zebra Braided Cable with Leather Belt Clip (cable retail \u00a325.99/$29.99)\n(combined savings versus RRP >30%)\nINCLUDES:\nThe Mu One - The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Charger\nNative Union Type-C Premium Braided Cable with Leather Belt Clip\nFree UK & US Shipping", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["398 backers", "Limited (27 left of 425)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a365 or more", "title": "Mu One + Premium Type-C Cable", "descp": "The Mu One | The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Fast Charger + Native Union Premium Type-C to C Zebra Braided Cable with Leather Belt Clip (cable retail \u00a325.99/$29.99)\n(combined savings versus RRP >20%)\nINCLUDES:\nThe Mu One - The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Charger\nNative Union Type-C Premium Braided Cable with Leather Belt Clip\nFree UK & US Shipping", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a385 or more", "title": "Mu One - Twin Pack", "descp": "2 x The Mu One | The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Fast Charger\n(saving >25% versus RRP)\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 The Mu One - The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Charger\nFree UK & US Shipping", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["285 backers", "Limited (15 left of 300)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3165 or more", "title": "Mu One - Office Pack", "descp": "4 x The Mu One | The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Fast Charger\n(saving >30% versus RRP)\nINCLUDES:\n4\u00d7 The Mu One - The World\u2019s Thinnest 45W International Charger\nFree UK & US Shipping", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["46 backers", "Limited (4 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3780 or more", "title": "Mu One - Squad Pack", "descp": "20 x Mu One's.

Our ancestors were doing it. Some Europeans still do it.\nIt\u2019s just somehow the rest of us have forgotten the benefits that napping can bring. In today's society napping is seen to equal laziness. Something that is reserved for quiet Sundays.\nThe opposite is true. Study after study has shown that taking a nap can help your body relax, build its natural coping mechanism to fight stress and boost your productivity.\nWe have spent years learning how to master naps because of the stressful lives we led. So let us help empower you to be the best you can be. \nPLAY\n\n Meet the Team \n     SWITCH OFF AND APOLOGISE TO NO ONE!\nAt Work\n  The worlds most progressive companies understand the impact of corporate wellness. Nap rooms will become the norm. Get the edge at work and increase your output. \nWhen Meditating\n  Wait until you experience the sound of monastery chants or the atmosphere of calming rain in Silentmode. This is a game-changing way to switch off your mind and meditate easily.\nWhen Travelling\n  You've just been upgraded! Take the pain out of traveling and block out those annoying disturbances. Rest efficiently and feel refreshed at your destination and ready to go!\n    Nap Mask\nWe have spent years on this journey and 24 months specifically designing, building, testing and preparing the ultimate relaxation mask for launch. Shut down your visual senses with this high-quality audio device and master the power of napping. \n      Features \n  Ensuring that you block all visual distractions is vital to calming down the brain. The Silentmode napping mask is 100% blackout with sockets that allow your eyes the freedom to move ensuring REM sleep can occur.\n  Our patent-pending design allows easy packing and transport as well as unrivaled comfort. Highest quality memory foams enable you can lay down comfortably in any position and maintain Silentmode.\n  A combination of soft-goods integrated with high quality bespoke audio drivers. Get comfortable and switch off with Breathonics nap music or play your own sounds on Spotify or any other music app.\nPLAY\n\nCustomised to Everyone\nOur patent-pending design allows you to customise each speaker placement ensuring you receive the highest quality experience possible.\nSuper Sonic Sound\nWe have partnered with leading audio providers to deliver the best sound experience possible. We've built our custom tuned hardware to deliver immersive frequencies and our proprietary napping music Breathonics. \n    Manufacturing\nMIA has brought 40 years of soft goods manufacturing to the project. Check out MIA Factory Director below discussing Silentmode.\nPLAY\n\n       PLAY\n\n RISE and Gary Vaynerchuck feedback \nPLAY\n\n  The Nap Music\n  Breathing correctly is the first step towards awesome naps. By clearing the mind and controlling one\u2019s breath it is possible to master the thoughts that flow around your head and keep you up at night, but it takes practice. Once you are able to clear your mind, your body will follow suit and awesome naps will become easier to obtain. This is all part of managing your sleep logistics.\nBreathonics - Music to Breathe.\nWatch the video below to find out more.\nPLAY\n\nPractice clearing your mind and relaxing your body with beautiful immersive music experiences.\n    PLAY\n\n    PLAY\n\nNaps can be used as a natural solution to stress and help you improve your productivity. If you are new to napping, we can help you practice and find your ideal napping routine.\n       Circadian Rhythm\nYour Circadian Rhythm is ruled by an internal clock encoded in your genes. It runs on a 24-hour, light-dark cycle in sync with the sun. When you are jetlagged this is when your Circadian Rhythm is out of sync with the sun in your location.\nNapping can help you find balance when you don't get enough sleep. Even a 20-minute nap can help boost your energy and help you restore levels of tiredness.\nSleep Cycles\n         Sleep Logistics  \nOur job at Silentmode is to develop our Napinness algorithm in order to tell you when it's the best time for you to take the perfect nap. We do this using a combination of data points from sleeping hours, wake up times and desired outcomes.\n  After a period of time, your data points will help the Silentmode Napinness Algorithm customise and output your perfect napping schedule ensuring you can be at your best.\nOne of our featured audio artists Tom Middleton (SONUX) - Bioharmonic Sleep and Relaxation Soundscape Designer / Sleep Science Psychoacoustic Researcher \nThe Circadian Rhythm has an influence on the amount of REM sleep you will receive in your nap. You may have experienced a dream early in the morning rather than right after you fall asleep at night. This is the effect of the Circadian Rhythm that peaks around 9 in the morning.\nBy understanding both your rhythm and sleep patterns it's possible to customise your naps to extract beneficial physical outcomes.\n      Famous Nappers \nThere have been a great number of famous nappers over the years. They understood the power of napping and how it could give them the edge in life. It's something they wouldn't compromise on. Would you like to learn their secret?\n  Why are we doing this?\nStress and sleep deprivation, the silent killer.\nLife is no fun when you\u2019re constantly bogged down with stress and anxiety. And here\u2019s what makes it even worse: When your body doesn\u2019t get the rest it needs, your stress and anxiety are not only compounded, but your body doesn\u2019t have the mental strength to fight it off.\nYou can fight back!\nNo matter what\u2019s causing your stress or anxiety, it can be improved with sleep. That\u2019s a fact. Better sleep gives you more energy, helps you focus, resets your mind, and reinvigorates your body. All of these benefits are proven to decrease stress and improve your well being.\nPLAY\n\nWe've been in your shoes and we are building the tools to help us all fight back. But we need your help!\nPlease help bring this project to the masses.

It appears some of your toilet lids have a very slight curve built in to them and the adhesive pad is not connecting with the full surface on those curved toilet lids. On some toilets pressing extra hard on the unit to make sure it gets full surface contact is solving that concern. \nOn others where the curve is too big we have tested using thicker adhesive ads and that solves the problem. It sticks perfectly with a thicker adhesive pad we have tested.

It makes drinking water a healthy addiction by making it taste closer to soda or juice. The scent and flavoring is safely added to the lid, which can be changed around. (Patent Pending) These flavoring oils have been approved for use both within the EU and by the FDA, are already used in existing beverages on the market, and can last anywhere from 6 to 12 months.\n20 seconds of your time could make a positive difference for someone else. Hydration is important, but so many of us don't get enough of it. Click one of the buttons below and share with someone who could use Flavour Bottle today.\nFlavour has all the flavors that you will love. \nThroughout 2016, we developed five flavors which include: strawberry, watermelon, orange, grape, and cola. \nThese flavors can also be enjoyed with carbonated water, which creates the fizz that many sodas and flavored waters have. \nSo How and Why Does it Work?\nAlthough our taste buds discern a good amount of flavor in 5 sensations (sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami), most scientists agree smell accounts for up to 80% of the sensation of taste.\nThrough a patented process, we\u2019ve managed to safely add food grade flavors to a silicone spout on the lids of the Flavour bottle. These are added during the manufacturing process, allowing the scent and flavor to last. \nRather than diffusing quickly, we\u2019ve used a process that gradually brings the flavor and scent to the top of the spout, allowing it to last much longer. Our scents have lasted up to 12 months, depending on the usage of the bottle. Once the scent and flavor is used up, an additional lid can be purchased to replace the old one, without having to replace the bottle. \nThe process is completely safe and is similar to edible waxes being incorporated into paper coffee cups to keep them from leaking. The silicone we are using is the same silicone already used by several other large water bottle companies on the market. \nAs you drink through the spout, you\u2019re also breathing in scented \u201cair\u201d from the straw itself, allowing you to get the full sensation of flavor while drinking water. You're also getting a hint of flavor from the flavoring oils coming through to the surface of the silicone. Structurally, we added a cap so that the scent wouldn't diffuse too quickly. \nWhen you are congested, you lose a bit of the flavor experience.  Food just doesn\u2019t taste as good when you can\u2019t smell. That\u2019s because a special channel connects the roof of the throat to the nose. When we eat and drink foods, odors make their way up through this channel to olfactory cells in the nose. It becomes blocked when we are sick or congested or even if we are consuming something while holding down our nose.\nThere has been a lot of work done in this field of science. Below are just a few of many resources on this topic.\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120530133708.htm\nhttp://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-jelly-bean-taste-smell/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuR6QuWrHrc&t=101s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJud8MKrvBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HxAB54wlig\nIt Really Works!\nWhen we initially begun working on the Flavour Bottle, we had been through many different experiments to really get this concept to work as well as it is claimed by science.\n\nWe spent over three years of research and development to get to a prototype we felt worked for everyone, not just those who have stronger senses of smell. \nOur very first prototype was a scented cap on top of a bottle. One of the first things we realized was that we don\u2019t consciously smell through our nose while eating or drinking. Most of the scent of our food is actually being breathed in through the back of our mouth. We also experimented with creating a scented plastic ring from plastic casting resin to put on top of a bottle.\nOur initial prototypes\nSo our first prototypes did not work nearly as well as we expected them to. They worked similarly to the way a cup would work with a rim to drink from. Although it made the experience of drinking water more pleasant, it did not really add any taste to the water we drank. We had also molded this initial cap out of plastic and fruit flavors, and the scent did not last very long.\nWe began to think, what if we created some sort of drinking spout that was flavored. Its proximity to the mouth while water is being drank would work much better.\n\nAnd Eureka! That is how the Flavour Bottle was born. Inspired by scented silicone bands as well as erasers with scents that have lasted a very long time, we decided to create a food grade silicone spout.\nOur first prototypes were a few food grade silicone straws that had watermelon scents infused into them. We wanted to test these straws out to make sure they conveyed what we felt they would. The positive reinforcement kept us going to develop the bottle fully. \nWe poured water in glasses and invited random students to try it out at the University of Texas at Austin. Check out the results below.\nPLAY\n\n\nThrough a proprietary process, we\u2019ve managed to add the natural flavors that beverage companies use in their drinks and safely insert them into our silicone spout. We are working with a manufacturer that sources food grade flavors that have been approved by both the FDA and the EU. \nThe silicone took in the scent much better than plastic, allowing it to last a lot longer and diffuse a lot slower. Silicone has a characteristic that allows the scent to release when it is rubbed or touched, as opposed to plastic, which diffuses into the air. It is for this reason that the scent within the silicone lasts a lot longer than in plastic. \nSpecifications\nWho is it for?\nOur goal is to make drinking water a healthy addiction just like drinking soda. Water is the healthiest drink at the end of the day, as it does not contain any extra sugars or other harmful ingredients. Many of us do not get enough of it because we gravitate towards unhealthy sodas. We vastly underestimate how much water we really need.  And for those of us who unfortunately suffer from diabetes, these sodas and juices aren\u2019t even an option, so it makes it more difficult to enjoy water with actual flavors and tastes added to it.\nBut What About Flavored Waters and Fruit Infusers?\nWe did a test and looked into the ingredients of several different flavored waters. Most of these ingredients as you can see are preservatives and other questionable ingredients such as aspartame. Plus, they get expensive over time.       \nFruit infusers are awesome, but we don\u2019t always have the time to cut up fruit to add it in to water, plus fruit goes bad quickly and can get expensive. Water is the healthiest drink on the market, without any sugar or added calories, and often times that\u2019s exactly what we need.\nWe\u2019ve also included a cola version and will continue to create more flavors inspired by soda, which cannot be mimicked by infusers.\nAdding carbonated water increases the sensation of cola in the cola flavor.\nRewards\nWe want to wholeheartedly thank you for believing in our vision. You can see our rewards below:     \nWe have worked hard to subsidize our shipping prices while still ensuring a quick delivery after prooduction. We are working with global fulfillment centers to reduce the amount of time shipment would take as well as the cost, which is difficult to reduce typically for international shipping. We are also using a special high barrier pouch to protect the scent on the bottle, which adds a little bit to the cost of shipping. \nAbout Us\n  Where are you in the process?\nWe have spent a long time perfecting our bottle, making sure it works as fantastically as it claims. We are working with a experienced material manufacturer to source food grade silicone as well as flavors from the world's largest flavoring oil company. These are flavors that have been approved for use both by the FDA and within the EU. \nWhat will the funds be used for?\nBringing a brand new product to market has its costs. We have a few working prototypes, but the silicone spouts we are working with have very high MOQs, so we need to raise the funds in order to be able to get a Flavour Bottle into the hands of everyone. This is because the process of using food grade flavors with silicone is a very specialized one and requires a very pristine environment, all of which lead to a high initial startup cost. \nWhat's Next?\nWe are super excited to be able to bring this product to market. The applications are endless, and we truly believe there are many additional modifications we can make over time, by adding more flavors or even adding a filter within the bottle. Below you can see our timeline and where you all have joined in in our journey. We are extremely excited to get this product in your hands, and we won't rest until we do.\nHelp Out by Sharing Flavour Bottle with all your Dehydrated friends. \nIf you like what you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re awesome! Don\u2019t be shy about sharing it with your equally great friends. It\u2019s so easy. Just hit one of the share buttons.\nThe more people know about the Flavour bottle, the more we can decrease this addiction to sugary drinks that\u2019s plaguing our world today. With more input, we can add many additional features that can make drinking water even more addictive. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll members of our team have backed Kickstarters that have had their delays and setbacks. No one wants to see a great idea executed poorly. An idea is worthless if it's never brought to fruition. We have spent a lot of time finding the perfect manufacturer for our water bottle, both the silicone part and the main body. Here's what we are doing to minimize any risk to you:\n\nManufacturing: Our most important part of this project is getting the silicone spout manufactured correctly. This means that the scent must be fully incorporated during the manufacturing phase. To really enhance the longevity of the silicone, we've worked with experts in the field of scent encapsulation, who have spent almost a decade developing this technology.\n\nProduct Adjustments: We want to deliver the best Flavour bottle to you, our backers who have put faith in us. That is why we encourage discussion throughout our process with our backers. If there is something we can do to improve the end product, we will consult with our manufacturers but also consult directly with our backers. Any modifications made will always be conveyed directly, and we promise to be honest and upfront.\n\nFulfillment: We've seen Kickstarter campaigns where a manufacturer did not deliver as promised or had issues with production machinery, which trickled down into the entire campaign. For production of the bottle itself, we have two back-up manufacturers that can handle the situation if something goes awry with our main manufacturer.

Insert a microSD card loaded with the provided open-source machine vision algorithms (including OpenCV 3.2 and many others), connect to your desktop, laptop, and/or Arduino, and give your projects the sense of sight immediately.\nJeVois started as an educational project, to encourage the study of machine vision, computational neuroscience, and machine learning as part of introductory programming and robotics courses at all levels (from K-12 to Ph.D.). At present, these courses often lack a machine vision component. This is mainly, we believe, because there is no simple machine vision device one can use together with the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or similar device used in these courses. JeVois aims to fill this gap by providing a self-contained, configurable machine vision engine that can deliver both visual outputs of how it is analyzing what it sees (useful to understand the algorithms), and text outputs over a serial link that describe what it has found (useful to send to a micro-controller that can control a robot).\nOverview\nThe JeVois framework operates as follows: video is captured from the camera sensor, processed on the fly through some machine vision algorithm directly on the camera's own processor, and the results are streamed over USB to a host computer and/or over serial to a micro-controller.\nTo the host computer, the JeVois smart camera is just another USB camera. Different vision algorithms are selected by changing USB camera resolution and framerate. Users or machines can also interact with the JeVois smart camera, change its settings, or listen for text-based vision outputs over serial link (both hardware serial and serial-over-USB are supported).\nThree major modes of operation:\nDemo/development mode: the smart camera outputs a demo display over USB that shows the results of its analysis, possibly along with simple results communicated over serial port (e.g., coordinates and content of any QRcode that has been identified).\nText-only mode: the smart camera provides no USB output, but only text strings, for example, commands for a pan/tilt controller.\nPre-processing mode: the smart camera outputs video that is intended for machine consumption, for example an edge map computed over the video frames captured by the camera sensor, or a set of image crops around the 3 most interesting objects in the scene. This video can then be further processed by the host computer, for example, using a massive deep neural network running on a cluster of high-power GPUs to recognize the three most interesting objects that the smart camera has detected. Text outputs over serial are of course also possible in this mode.\nBut, really, anything is possible, since the whole JeVois software framework is open-source.\nHardware Specs\nAt a glance:\n A brief tour:\nThe JeVois smart camera is a complete Linux computer. It can run on its own, without a host PC. Thanks to the cooling fan, it can run under full processing load without overheating and while maintaining a constant 1.34 GHz CPU speed.\n Software Specs\nA few examples (watch the video for more). All results shown below are computed on the JeVois camera itself. The smart camera does all the work, including image capture, vision processing, and creating the demo displays. The host computer only runs a standard video camera software (e.g., guvcview on a Linux host) to display the smart camera's results.\nVisual Attention detects interesting things in the world\n In the above, the algorithm processing speed is 73.1 fps on the smart camera's processor, that is, it takes 13.68 ms to process one video frame. The camera sensor captures frames at 60 fps (16.67 ms per frame), which sets the video streaming speed. One could run some additional algorithms during the 3 ms difference. Also note that the CPU is not fully loaded by this algorithm (148.7% load, while 400% would correspond to fully loading all 4 CPU cores). Hence additional algorithms could also run in parallel with visual attention.\nAugmented reality markers (ArUco)\n  Object detection and recognition\n  Road detection for autonomous driving\n  120Hz eye tracking (camera streams at 120 fps, processing runs at 200+ fps)\nand see many more in the campaign video.\nThis is an open-source project. Anyone can contribute. Which vision algorithms will you create?\nHost Computer Requirements\nThe JeVois smart camera can work as a standalone computer, with no USB video streaming. In such case, one would usually simply stream commands to an Arduino or similar over the serial port. All you need then is to provide power to the JeVois camera's mini-USB connector.\nFor video streaming over USB:\nLinux (including Raspberry Pi): Works out of the box, no drivers needed, all functionality is available. You can switch between different vision processing modes on the fly and at runtime, by selecting different camera resolutions and frame rates on your host computer. For example, 640x300@60fps may run the visual attention algorithm, while 320x256@60fps may run the QRcode detection algorithm. A configuration file on the MicroSD card establishes the mapping between USB video resolution and frame rate, camera sensor resolution and frame rate, and vision algorithm to run.\nWindows, Mac OS X: Streaming works but selecting among different available video resolutions has become increasingly difficult with newer versions of Windows and OS X. It seems that these operating systems do not want to let you choose a camera resolution or frame rate. This choice, however, is how one can switch on the fly between different vision algorithms on the JeVois camera. One workaround is to configure your JeVois smart camera with only one vision algorithm (achieved by commenting out entries for other resolutions in a configuration file on the MicroSD card). Then the host computer will have no choice but to use that one.\nAndroid: The camera is detected but streaming video does not work yet. We are working on this and we suspect this has to do with deviations from the USB video class (UVC) standard on the Android side. For example, a USB packet sniffer has revealed that the Android device insists on querying camera controls that were not declared as being supported by the JeVois hardware.\niOS: The JeVois smart camera, and any other USB camera we have tried, are currently reported as not being a supported device. This may change in the future.\nConnecting to Arduino or similar\nDeveloping for JeVois\nEverything is cross-compiled on a host computer. At present only Linux is supported for compiling JeVois software. JeVois software is written in C++17, with a few low-level algorithms in optimized C. We use CMake to manage the build process. This allows you to build for both your host computer and for the JeVois hardware, both at the same time. This is very useful during development, since you can test your algorithms using any USB webcam and observe the results in a window on your screen. You can also use your host computer to train a deep neural network quickly, and then just load the weights onto your MicroSD card. The JeVois operating system is Linux and its features are managed by buildroot.\nScripts are provided to automate the process:\nrebuild-host.sh - compile the entire JeVois software suite natively on a host computer. You can use it with a USB webcam, and it display outputs in a window on your screen.\nrebuild-platform.sh - cross-compile the entire JeVois software suite for the smart camera hardware.\njevois-build.sh - flash the cross-compiled results from rebuild-platform.sh to a MicroSD card.\nContributions & novelty\nIn principle, you could assemble a working machine vision system using existing embedded computer boards, adding a camera, and programming a USB output. In fact, this how we started... - er, two years ago!\nThe hurdles we encountered and solved in creating JeVois are as follows:\n- Linux support for camera chips is often very limited. We wrote our own highly efficient kernel driver and figured out how to configure undocumented camera chip registers to support all the controls available on the camera (exposure, frame rate, etc). Most camera drivers in the Linux kernel only support one or a few resolutions and frame rates, many do not support controls such as manual exposure, etc. You could use a USB camera, for which support for the controls has been standardized, but not many support 60 or 120 frames/s, and they would increase the overall size, weight, power and cost of the system. Our kernel camera driver exploits hardware that is integrated into our CPU chip for direct image capture from a camera sensor. This is faster, provides lower latency (time between image capture and start of rocessing), and uses less CPU resources than attaching a USB camera sensor.\n- Linux support for the device-side of video streaming over USB is virtually non-existent (in open source). This is software that you need to run on the smart camera's CPU to make it appear as if it was a USB camera to a connected host computer. A webcam gadget module has been present in the Linux kernel source tree for several years, but its functionality is very limited, and, as we discovered, its very core logic is broken. We developed a fully working device-side kernel USB Video Class driver, with highly efficient data streaming and pass-through support for video resolutions, pixel formats, frame rates, and camera controls (when users change those on the host computer, the changes are relayed to the camera sensor chip).\n- Many small embedded computer boards exist, but software support is often limited, and quality sometimes is low. We had to fix kernel USB drivers, kernel GPU drivers, kernel camera drivers, and many other elements in the Linux kernel to make it work flawlessly while supporting all the features listed above. Small embedded boards also are no match for our solution in terms of total system size (including camera, connectors, fan), power consumption, speed and video latency (delay between capturing an image and presenting the processing results to the host computer), and out-of-the box enjoyment and reliability. For example, one has to face the reality that a quad-core chip will just overheat under load if it does not have a fan or very, very large heatsink.\nWe employed special design and manufacturing techniques which enabled us to deliver a complete, self-contained system in a tiny form factor. As an example, we run our DDR3 memory at its full rated clock speed (DDR3-1600), while other ARM boards we have surveyed on the market sometimes run at just half that speed. We achieved optimum speed as the result of extremely detailed circuit board design and optimization, and through the use of custom design, simulation, and fabrication tools. It makes a big difference for many vision processing algorithms (about 15% faster).\nIn summary, because we are developing the hardware, software and mechanical design jointly, we are able to deliver a highly optimized, plug-and-play, high satisfaction solution that just does not exist anywhere else today.\nLong-Term Vision\nWith JeVois we aim to enable everyone to use machine vision in embedded, IoT, robotics, and educational projects. While this campaign is to help us bootstrap the mass manufacturing of the hardware, we continue to work on the following open-source software aspects:\nSoftware development is gearing up to provide a repository of machine vision modules shared by the community. This is the equivalent of an app store for JeVois. It is expected to come online by February, before the devices start shipping.\nWe are developing a curriculum of activities around the JeVois camera for all levels (from kindergarten to Ph.D.). Activities will start at the entry level (just point the camera towards something and see whether it can identify it), to learning how the underlying machine vision algorithms work, to modifying existing algorithms, and finally learning vision theory and developing your own algorithms. This is expected to become available in April. We will leverage significant material we have developed by teaching robotics, vision, and artificial intelligence courses at the undergraduate and graduate level over the past 15 years.\nOur overall mission is an educational and outreach one. We hope that JeVois will help us and others translate the latest vision research results into working machines. JeVois will be integrated to our outreach activities, which include working with neighboring K-12 schools, our Robotics Open House program, and others. We have a small budget already available for outreach, which includes loaning and donating some JeVois hardware to interested students. Details will be available in February.\nComparison to the Raspberri Pi 3 model B\nRewards\nRewards include barebones kits and turnkey kits in several quantities. Choose a barebones kit if you already have microSD cards and mini-USB cables and do not need more of those. Choos a turnkey kit if you want to be ready to run out the box.\nColors\nChoose your colors in the backer survey after you place your pledge. Note that with the lighter colors, you will see the LED shine through the plastic case and make a small halo around the hole in the case for the LED. You may want this for better visibility or not if you find it distracting. The color that makes the most sense from a machine vision standpoint is black.\nThanks\nThis campaign is basically to build a batch of units that achieves low mass production costs. Please help us spread the word if you like this project.

Just a year later we have successfully brought the UP Board into mass production and delivered it to more than 12,000 different makers in the fields of IOT, Entertainment, Digital signage, Smart Home automation, Robotics, Intelligent vending, Industrial automation and more. Now, we're elated to announce UP\u00b2 (UP Squared), the most powerful maker board out there.\n\nUP\u00b2 (UP Squared) is an ultra compact single board computer with high performance and low power consumption. It features the latest Intel\u00ae Apollo Lake Celeron\u2122 and Pentium\u2122 Processors with only 4W of Scenario Design Power and a powerful and flexible Intel\u00ae FPGA Altera MAX 10 onboard.\nAiming to bridge the gap between makers and industrial markets, the UP team challenged ourselves yet again to bring a cost effective board in x86 architecture by adding some form factor creativity and increasing elements in embedded flavors. Nevertheless, we still hold onto some of the fun as a Maker board with our 40-pin GP-bus. Our ideas transform into a full industrial-featured Maker board, UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) which starts selling from \u20ac89 on Kickstarter\n\nInheriting the 40-pin GP-bus from the first generation of UP, although this time controlled by Altera FPGA MAX 10, UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) is powered by Intel\u00ae Celeron\u2122 Dual Core N3350 up to 2.4GHz,  Intel\u00ae Pentium\u2122 Quad Core N4200 up to 2.5Ghz, or Intel\u00ae Atom\u2122 x5-E3940 up to 1.8GHz, up to 8GB of RAM LPDDR4 Dual Channels 64 bit onboard, up to 128 GB onboard eMMC 5.0, more I/O ports including 3 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0, 2 Gigabit LAN, 1 HDMI, 1 DP, eDP, mini PCI-e/mini card SATA, M.2 2230, SATA 3.0, 2 CSI and additional 60 pin board-to-board expansion (EXHAT) with GPIO and many other features.  \nLatest Intel\u00ae Apollo Lake SoC\nIntel Apollo Lake is the latest family of Intel Atom\u2122, Celeron\u2122 and Pentium\u2122 Processor with 7 years product longevity.

Thermal design and the step up to x5-Z8350 delayed the UP Board project. With the next generation UP\u00b2 (UP Squared), we are taking a different path on thermal design, using all our knowledge gained from UP. \n\nWith UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) we have spent more than two months discussing all specifications and component placement. We've driven all product capabilities in once, therefore we remain confident that no more upgrade options need to be managed later on. We've brought together a logistic team in-house, this will assist us in providing a delivery plan and handle all orders efficiently!\n\nWe had to work with LPDDR4 technology for the first time together with a complete new architecture that hasn\u2019t reached the market yet. Just a few days back, we amended the design to enhance the memory bandwidth. Now, we are working on developing the drivers for Altera FPGA MAX 10 to control the 40 Pin I/O as well as the 60 Pin. We are also improving layout optimixations and eMMC firmware boot.\n\nUP\u00b2 (UP Squared) is the answer to all applications.\n.\nAre you up for UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) ?

Since the advent of voice interaction technology, our life has truly become easier in many ways.\nWe think we can take advantage of this technology, and achieve more with it \u2013 ReSpeaker provides an open source, modular voice interface that allows us to hack things around us, just using our voices.\nRather than a voice assistant that fulfills simple tasks only when you asked, ReSpeaker provides a hands-free way of voice interaction for you and your surroundings. \nWith ReSpeaker, you are able to control, or even communicate with your toy robot, your home appliances, your plant, your office, your internet-equipped devices and many other things in your daily life.\nMore detail about the Stretch Goal 1 please go to: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/respeaker-an-open-modular-voice-interface-to-hack/posts/1663367\nMore detail about the Stretch Goal 2 please go to: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/respeaker-an-open-modular-voice-interface-to-hack/posts/1679978\nPowered by the MT7688 Wi-Fi module and the built-in high performance microphone, ReSpeaker responds to your voice and recognize your speeches based on powerful online cognitive services like Microsoft Cognitive Service, Amazon Alexa Voice Service, Google Speech API, Wit.ai and Houndify.\nAlso with the on board SD card slot to extend the storage and the integrated lightweight speech recognition engine - the PocketSphinx, ReSpeaker works equally well for keywords spotting when offline. You can have a large vocabulary and audio files stored in local storage to implement the speech recognition at anytime, anywhere, even without the internet.\nSetting up ReSpeaker is super easy and only takes a few minutes.\nWithout any App installation, you can start by connecting ReSpeaker to your WiFi network and then directly use our Web-based App to access a range of rich featured applications that ReSpeaker has provided, includes music streaming, file manager, plug-in, customized settings and more.\nVoice interface has never been apart from music entertainment, so does ReSpeaker. \nReSpeaker supports Airplay/DLNA for wireless music streaming. Just connect ReSpeaker to any ordinary speaker with an AUX cable, then you can start enjoying the music you love without pressing a single button.\nOf course we want to explore more possibilities coming out from ReSpeaker, and to achieve that we believe the best way is to leverage the power of the open source community. ReSpeaker runs the OpenWrt system that is based on Linux, which makes it 100% friendly to developers. \nAnd provided with our detailed and easy-to-use SDK, developers are able to develop more applications using Python on Linux. ReSpeaker also supports other popular programming languages like C/C++, Arduino, JavaScript and Lua.\nReSpeaker is not limited to what it can do for now, it is always growing. We\u2019ve developed a plug-in system that would continuously expand ReSpeaker\u2019s features and functionalities in the future. \nOur team will keep adding more plug-ins for ReSpeaker to cover as many things as possible that people want to have voice interactions with. \nAdvanced users can also develop their own plug-ins using our user-friendly Python APIs. All the plug-ins will be shared on the Web APP and free-to-download for everyone.  \nIn addition to the plug-in system, ReSpeaker is also extendable with plug-n-play hardware add-ons. \nThe far-field MIC Array allows your ReSpeaker to be able to recognize your location and hear you from across the room even while the music is playing. \nAnd the Grove extension board brings even more possibilities as you can connect various Grove sensors and actuators to extend its capabilities. The two onboard expansion headers also offer I2S, I2C, AUX, USB 2.0, GPIOs and many other interfaces that you can use for more applications.\nYou might wondering why ReSpeaker does not have speaker. In fact it does. We've cooperated with Meow King Audio Electronic Company and develop the Meow King Drive Unit. It can be directly connected to the bottom of ReSpeaker Core to produce beautiful sound out of it.\nAll the add-ons are modularized and have an identical disk design same as the core board. They can be stacked to one another when they are connected through soldering-free pins and header.\nTo improve the voice interaction experience, we developed the ReSpeaker Mic Array based on the XVSM-2000 Smart Microphone from XMOS. The board integrates 7 PDM microphones to help enhance ReSpeaker's acoustic DSP performance to a much higher level. With the Mic Array attached onto the top of the ReSpeaker Core, the Core is now able to: \nHear You From Far Away\nFocus On Your Voice\n Improve Your Voice Quality\nThe exposed PCB design does not mean ReSpeaker is just for people who knows a lot about hardware or software. \nThe plug-in system is designed for the community to share and download their voice interactive projects as a simple plug-in to the ReSpeaker module. It has significantly simplified the use of ReSpeaker as anyone who has a ReSpeaker can install the plug-ins they want with a single click, and after that they can run voice interaction just like any others. \nDevelopers can of course achieve more with the SDK we provide to develop their own voice interaction projects .\nFor beginners, we have step-by-step tutorials and recipes to help you getting started with your first project with ReSpeaker.\nRather than the on board MT7688 Wi-FI module which runs the Linux based OpenWrt, ReSpeaker is also powered by the ATmega32u4 chip and it\u2019s absolutely Arduino compatible, which means, we can use ReSpeaker as a powerful Arduino board and do many \u2018Arduino\u2019 things. It\u2019s for learning, it\u2019s for practicing, and it\u2019s for fun.\nFor example, you can program it with Arduino IDE to have a special DIY piano that is built on 8 cherry tomatoes connecting to the 8 touch sensors of ReSpeaker.\nWe are making ReSpeaker compatible with our previous project the Wio Link and the subsequent members of the Wio family the Wio Node and the Wio Core.\nWio Link is an ESP8266 based open-source Wi-Fi development board to create IoT applications by virtualizing plug-n-play Grove modules to RESTful APIs with mobile APPs. \nMore information about Wio Link can be either find at our previous Kickstarter Campaign :\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/wio-link-3-steps-5-minutes-build-your-iot-applicat/description\nor at Wio Link's official website:\nhttp://iot.seeed.cc/\nThere are videos demonstrate what is Wio Link and how easy it is to build an Internet of Things application with Wio Link,\nHow exactly does ReSpeaker works with the Wio Link/Node/Core?\nThe introduction of the Wio family has truly brought what ReSpeaker can do to a higher level. \nTo user ReSpeaker with Wio, simply pair your ReSpeaker to your Wio product using our Web App, then you can have a voice interaction with any of your IoT devices that is built on Wio. Like voice control your Pet Feeder built with Wio to dispense treats, or ask your Wio based Smart Plant if she need some water. \nCheck out the following demoes to see the VOICE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOU AND...\nFor each ReSpeaker Core reward it also comes with a 8G Class 10 Micro SD Card. \n ReSpeaker Core Module\n- AI7688 Wi-Fi Module\nOperation system: GNU/Linux based OpenWrt\nWi-Fi Network: Support Legacy 802.11b/g and HT 802.11n modes  \nExpansion: Two expansion headers for I2C, GPIO and USB 2.0 host \nInterfaces: Built-in 3.5mm AUX port, Micro USB and SD card slot \n- ATMega32U4 Coprocessor  \nUSB CDC virtual serial port for linux console\n12 programmable RGB LED indicators  \n8 on board touch sensors\n- Codec WM8960\nDAC SNR 98dB (\u2018A\u2019 weighted), THD -84dB at 48kHz, 3.3V  \nADC SNR 94dB (\u2018A\u2019 weighted), THD -82dB at 48kHz, 3.3V  \nStereo Class D Speaker Driver with 87% efficiency (1W output)  \nOn-chip Headphone Driver  \n40mW output power into 16\u03a9 at 3.3V  \nTHD -75dB at 20mW, SNR 90dB with 16\u03a9 load  \nOn-chip PLL provides flexible clocking scheme  \nSample rates: 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz\n- Power Supply: 5V DC  \n- Dimensions: 70mm diameter  \n- Weight: 17g\n\n\nMic Array\nXMOS microcontroller with 16 cores inside  \n7 high performance digital microphones\nSupports Far-field Voice Capture (up to 10m)\nSupports Beamforming, Acoustic Source Localization, Nosie Suppression, De-reverberation and Acoustic Echo Cancellation\n12 programmable RGB LED indicators  \nMicrophones: ST MP34DT01-M  \nSensitivity: -26 dBFS (Omnidirectional)  \nAcoustic overload point: 120 dBSPL  \nSNR: 61 dB  \nPower Supply: 5V DC from Micro USB or expansion header  \nDimensions: 70mm (Diameter)  \nWeight: 15.25g\nGrove Extension Board\nGrove Ports: 10\nDigital I/Os: 3\nAnalog I/Os: 4\nI2C Interface: 2\nUART: 1\nDimensions: 70mm (Diameter)\nWeight: 15.25g\nMeow King Drive Unit\nRated Power: 5W\nImpedance: 4\u03a9\nSNR: \u2265 75dBA\nSensitivity: 550 \u00b1 50mV\nDegree of Distortion: \u2264 0.5% \nFrequency Response: 85Hz - 20kHz\nPower Supply: 5V through USB or through 3.7V, 1500mAh battery\nSpeaker Diameter:  40mm\nSeeed has always been an open Source hardware innovation platform from the very beginning.

ZEEQ is not just another device or accessory, it is an active participant in your sleep. ZEEQ can play music to help you fall asleep, monitor and react to your snoring, analyze your sleep and intelligently wake you up. Unlike other sleep technology ZEEQ actually responds to the data it collects.\n    ZEEQ will help you fall asleep by allowing you to listen to music through the pillow and letting you choose music from your favorite sources. You can set a sleep timer in the app so the music will stop automatically - that way you can focus on sleep. We have even created some new relaxing tracks (some even using binaural beats) to help you fall asleep faster and achieve even more restful sleep.\nIf ZEEQ hears snoring, it will gently vibrate the pillow to encourage a new sleeping position. \nYour natural sleep movements are recorded and used to wake you up at the ideal moment in your sleep cycle, making groggy mornings a thing of the past. Most importantly, ZEEQ is the most comfortable pillow you will ever own. \n All the technology in the world will never be more important than softness, support, and premium materials, but luckily ZEEQ integrates technology and comfort seamlessly.\nMake sleep a priority no matter your lifestyle. ZEEQ integrates into your existing sleep habits and improves your sleep without you even being aware of it.  \n ZEEQ links to a smartphone app, so you can see your sleep data, including your Snore Score. If you want to take it a step farther, the app can help you track your diet, exercise and other habits to analyze how these factors effect your sleep, so you can make changes toward more restful slumber.\n                The ZEEQ Difference\nThe ZEEQ pillow will improve your sleep quality and quantity in multiple ways.\nIf you fall asleep better with music, REM-Fit Audio lets you stream music wirelessly, so you don\u2019t have to sleep with headphones in and you won\u2019t disturb your partner. You can even use one of the REM-Fit soundscapes if you prefer a more ambient experience.\nPLAY\n\nThe Snore Alarm uses a built in microphone with decibel sensitivity to hear snoring, and responds by gently vibrating the pillow to encourage the user to change positions without waking them up. \nPLAY\n\nAs soon as you go to bed, ZEEQ will start to monitor your sleep. It uses a 3-axis gyroscope to detect your motion throughout the night and provide data on the quality of your sleep.\nPLAY\n\nSmart Wake senses where you are in your sleep cycle based on these movements, and wakes you up at the ideal moment in a predetermined time range. It will use soft vibrations to wake you gently without affecting your partner. \nPLAY\n\nMost importantly, ZEEQ is the most comfortable pillow you will ever own. REM-Fit is an expert in pillows and bedding, and will never sacrifice comfort for technology. A cozy, supportive memory foam shell and soft, durable Tencell pillow case make this pillow a dream to lay your head on. \nPLAY\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFall asleep effortlessly, sleep peacefully and wake up rejuvenated.\nAren\u2019t you ready to see how it feels to be rested and energized for the two thirds of your life that you spend awake?\n    The ZEEQ App\nZEEQ integrates with a smartphone app to deliver sleep and snore data. You can use as few or as many of ZEEQ\u2019s features as you want, and you can customize each one to your preference. \n\nWant to turn down the vibration strength of your pillow?\nWant to listen to Spotify as you fall asleep? \n\nAll this and more can be controlled from the ZEEQ app. \n See your 7 day trends on the app's dashboard. Find out how well you fared on sleep quality and snore score.\nZEEQ is an active participant in your sleep, and if you want to be an active participant too you can use the manual features provided in the app such as diet, caffeine and alcohol consumption, exercise tracking and more. \n As the app learns more about your habits, both while asleep and while awake, it can detect patterns and correlations and start to make suggestions on how to improve your sleep quality.\n  Bonus Rewards\nWhen you back either of our Bonus Pack reward levels, you will receive one or more REM-Fit Activity Trackers. The activity tracker is the perfect compliment to your ZEEQ pillow because it tracks your activity during the day while ZEEQ monitors your sleep, and they both use the same app for integrated information.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Track your steps, distance and calories burned\n\u2022 ActivePoints - ActivePoints reward you for more than just your steps by analyzing the intensity and duration of your activity. The more active you are in a day, the more ActivePoints you can earn. \n\u2022 360 LifeScore - Strive for a great night of sleep and a day of activity. Your SleepPoints and ActivePoints contribute to an overall 360 LifeScore.\nSpecifications\n  Dimensions: 21\u201dx 27\u201d, the standard pillow size \nMaterials: Tencel pillowcase, memory foam outer shell, comfort filling \nBattery: 5000 mAh rechargeable, lasts approximately 1 week\nElectronics: 3-Axis gyroscope, vibration motors, individual decibel tuned microphone, 8 precision placed speakers\nReward Levels\n     Project Development \nAll the heavy lifting is done; we are already near completion on our design and engineering. We have several functional samples of the pillow. We already have manufacturers for all our components and have visited the factories in Shenzhen, Shanghai and India 8 separate times.\n  There are a few big steps left to take: tooling, international testing and manufacturing. Your support will help us produce our first order of ZEEQ!\nThe good news for supporters is that the wait for the finished product will be short - you will have ZEEQ under your head in less than 6 months!\nTimeline\n Get Your Project Funded Today!\nwww.funded.today/get-more-pledges \nAbout the Company \nPLAY\n\n\nREM-Fit is a team of dedicated individuals who believe in a restful night\u2019s sleep. \nBeing fitness enthusiasts, we know how important rest and recovery are to any training routine, which is why we developed the first Total Sleep Recovery product line to help you meet your fitness goals.\nLaunched in 2014, REM-Fit is an active lifestyle bedding brand that that helps you achieve a healthy and active lifestyle by getting the best sleep possible for maximum recovery and comfort. The REM-Fit product line consists of three product categories: The REST, the ENERGIZE and the MOTIVATE Collections.\nBy focusing on both activity and the sleep needed for recovery, REM-Fit Active is an exciting way for you, no matter what fitness level, to track your sleep and activity and contribute to living a healthy lifestyle.\nREM-Fit is a division of Protect-A-Bed, a company with over 35 years of experience in the sleep industry and more than 8000 stores across the country.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPILLOW COMFORT:\nA pillow is a very personal item and people have different options on the ideal pillow. We have worked hard to make a pillow that will be very comfortable for all types of sleeping positions and firmness preferences.\n\nMAKING EVERYTHING WORK TOGETHER:\nThere are a lot of sensors and components inside of a very soft object. Not only must if feel great to sleep on, it has to work properly. The noise sensors must react properly; the vibration motors must be strong enough to be felt through the padding, but not overpowering. We had to write new algorithms and logic so that all of our various components worked in concert with each other easily and effectively. \n\nDECIBEL READING:\nHaving a microphone that can detect sound down to a specific decibel and then react properly is a key component. The microphone has to be cost effective, sensitive and accurate. This is not an easy feat!\n\nAPP LOGIC:\nWith all the information coming from the pillow, the app needs to not only read the raw data, but present it in a way that makes sense to the end user. Also, the app must be easy to use, which can be a challenge with all the features available to the user.\n\nMANUFACTURING:\nWe have already done all the heavy lifting: We have factories lined up, components sourced and functional prototypes created.

They should be completed when we start shipping in July.\nEnjoy the $9 discounted price before it goes up when officially launched in August. Tell your friends too!!\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth are essential!\nThey are the most frequently used wireless technologies; we use them to access the internet, connect cordless keyboards and many more. However, Pi Zero and previous Raspberry Pi models do not have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in.\nWhat is IoT HAT?\nIoT (Internet-of-Things)\nHAT (Hardware Attached on Top)\nIt is an add-on board that provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for the Raspberry Pi.\nYou can use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth USB dongles, however .......\nIoT HAT is more affordable\nYou get both functions for the price of one dongle. And if you are using Pi Zero, you may also need to purchase:\nUSB OTG cable ($3-$5) - connect a normal USB device to the Pi Zero's micro USB port.\nUSB hub with power adapter ($15-$30) - if you need to connect more than one USB device, it is advisable to use a powered hub for your Wi-Fi and/or USB Bluetooth dongle(s). \nThe setup is more orderly\nBecause you do not need the USB OTG Cable and the USB Hub etc, the setup is faster and looks less cluttered.\nIf you are running an IoT project, you could also remove the keyboard and mouse.\nIoT HAT has the same wireless radio as the Pi 3\nWe are using the same BCM43438 chip that is on the Pi 3 (read here) which supports both Wi-Fi 802.11n (2.4GHz) + Bluetooth 4.1 (Dual Mode \u2013 Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy) running at the same time.\nThe wireless radio of IoT HAT is as good as that of the Pi 3 and all WiFi/Bluetooth software for Pi 3 are compatible.\nRead the full blog post\nYou can extend the RF range easily\nThe IoT HAT has an on-board antenna. However if you want to increase the RF range, you can simply attach a compatible antenna to the external antenna socket and flip a switch. No hacking or soldering is required.\nBoth Wi-Fi and Bluetooth operate on the same 2.4GHz frequency, they share the on-board antenna or an external antenna when running.\nPi Zero + IoT HAT is the best IoT combo\nNot only is the combination the cheapest of all the options, it has also has the lowest power consumption!\nOur partners\nYou can connect to your Pi over the Internet easily with Weaved's IoT Kit for the Raspberry Pi. We are working closely with their engineers to ensure our HAT supports all their services.\nOur friends at 8Bitdo have made a special edition of their popular ZERO GamePad for this campaign.\nThe recalbox allows you to replay a variety of video game consoles and platforms, in your living room, with ease! The recalboxOS is free and open source. \nLive demos\nRunning Wi-Fi sockets and controlling 8 BLE devices at the same time.\n- Pi Zero + IoT HAT running a Nodejs socket server with Sandeep Mistry\u2019s noble BLE library \n- BLE Nano running BLE Peripheral firmware developed on mbed platform\nMore details about this demo is available on the this post.\nPLAY\n\nRunning Raspbian desktop with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nPLAY\n\nMedia Center - Kodi on recalbox.\nPLAY\n\nBattle with your friends in your favorite retro games.\nPLAY\n\nTechnical details\nLayout\nDimensions\nIoT HAT is designed to fit perfectly on the Pi Zero, measuring 65 x 30 mm.\nAnd it is also compatible with all previous Pi models with the 40-pins connector including Pi 2, model A+ and B+.\nPinout\nAfter connecting the IoT HAT, there are 11 GPIO pins left for you to use.\nRewards\nWe offer the IoT HAT, the RedBear ZERO GamePad and the Antenna Kit (antenna with interface cable) as rewards.\nIoT HAT is shipped with a 2x20 female header soldered.\nYou can choose not to have the header soldered when you fill in the survey form and we will include the header in your shipment. You can mix these options if you order more than one HAT.\nIf you're interested in getting more of an item, or creating a combination not listed in the rewards section, simply add the extra corresponding costs to your total pledge amount:\nIoT HAT - add $9 each \nAntenna Kit - add $6 each\nRedBear ZERO GamePad - add $10 each\nShipping & delivery\nWe are keeping this very simple and affordable; we will ship any quantity, anywhere in the world for $5! That\u2019s right, any quantity!\nAfter the campaign has ended, we will send you a survey form to fill in the delivery, contact information, IoT HAT choice (with/without header) and extra item(s) you have pledged. The shipping address can be different from your billing address.\nWe fulfilled our last Kickstarter campaign on schedule and we aim to repeat this!\nWe had our first successful Kickstarter campaign, RedBear Duo, back in December 2015.

ThreadStax streamlines the daily process of folding, storing and selecting your outfits so you save time, maximize space and can focus on the important things in life.\nThreadStax is a closet organizing solution that folds and stacks shirts, jeans, pants, and other garments in a neat, impossible-to-disturb stacks. Utilizing the power of magnets, ThreadStax keeps your closet and drawers looking sharp and easy to navigate. Just enough magnetism to keep the stack in place, while allowing you to flip through and select your clothes with a gentle tug. Air vents allow clothes to breathe, and spacers not only provide support to the stack, but keep delicate items from being crushed underneath your other items.\nSlides\n At the heart of the system are slides that separate your clothes. They can be used to separate single items or entire outfits. Featuring magnets to keep everything in order when you\u2019re searching through your wardrobe.\nBrackets\n Brackets are easy to install and remove thanks to Command\u2122 strips. They adhere to any surface and remove without damage. Watch this 16 second video for a demo.\nThe Brackets come in two sizes, 4 and 6 inch (10cm and 15.25cm).

From T-Shirts to Towels.\n Drawers  \nWe know what you're wondering, YES ThreadStax works in drawers too! The brackets adhere to the back of any drawer that is 3.5\" (8.9cm) or taller. Minimum internal measurements are the following:  \n1 stack: 12.5\" deep x 10\" wide and 3.5\" tall (32cm x 25.5cm x 9cm)\n2 stacks: side by side 12.5\" deep x 20\" wide and 3.5\" tall\n3 stacks: side by side is 12.5\" deep x 30\" wide and 3.5\" tall\nShelves  \nSearching for the right outfit is fast and easy with ThreadStax.\n We know how easily it happens. You spend a good chunk of laundry day folding and reorganizing, but a few days later clothes always end back in a state of disarray. Whether it\u2019s rifling to find that one shirt or trying to pull something from the bottom of the shelf, it\u2019s inevitable. It made us ask:\n In a poll we took, over half the population has clean clothes cluttering their homes. 90% of which admitted feeling demotivated to fold their clothes at all because they never stay that way. ThreadStax is here to bring order to those unruly clothes.\n  Born from the need to get our closets and dressers organized, ThreadStax also maximizes space, saves time and most importantly, keeps everything neat and accessible.\n Not just great for T-Shirts.

Furthermore, rather than finding players on ChatRoulette, our 50 final players for Level 3 will be randomly selected from our backers! \nWe're crowdfunding here on Kickstarter, and on our own website to raise the funds to create Level 3. Whichever way you choose to support us, the money will go to the same place and you will receive access to the same content and privileges.\nIf you don't want to pledge then just sit back and wait - you'll still be able to watch the Level 3 video on YouTube just like you've watched Levels 1 and 2.\n Level 1\n Level 2\n Since Level 1, all we have heard is \u2018How can I play?\u2019 and \u2018We want to put this on VOD\u2019, but nothing was a good fit. Then it struck us - through crowdfunding we have found a way to keep it on YouTube, keep it free to watch AND allow people to play. So, starting with Level 3, it\u2019s no longer a prank on the internet, it\u2019s no longer random strangers on ChatRoulette - we are going to build a community.\nYour \u00a31 pledge won\u2019t just give you the chance to be chosen to play Level 3, it will also give you access to an account at RLFPS.com where you can become part of our creative community, with exclusive behind the scenes access, and voting rights on pre-production.\nYou\u2019ll get to collectively choose anything from character names, to costume designs, to setpieces - when our props team come up with designs for a new weapon, you will be able to vote on which design goes into production and gets built!\nYou all come together for a massive playable live stream of the prologue to Level 3 - this is where it gets really cool\u2026\nFrom Level 3 onwards we are doing away with the genre-hopping and creating a consistent universe - so you will follow the characters and the plot across multiple levels of the game. The story picks up right where we left off in Level 2 - with you and the other survivor piloting the escape pod.\nThe prologue for Level 3 will be broadcast live, and controlled by the voting of all of our backers simultaneously, just like \u2018Twitch does Pokemon\u2019 - except with the actors reacting live to the results of all of your choices. You\u2019re in charge of staying alive, and trying to find somewhere to land the escape pod - all of your decisions will have repercussions that will echo across Level 3 and way beyond.\nOnce the prologue is finished, it\u2019s time for us to start playing the full level - and instead of going to ChatRoulette this time, we\u2019ll be selecting 50 players, at random, from all of our backers. Each of the chosen players will play through the five chapters of Level 3 - as long as they make it through alive\u2026\nIf you aren\u2019t picked for the full game, you\u2019ll still be able to watch the events unfold. We will be live streaming from the webcam of each player as they face the challenges, but you won\u2019t see what they see - to keep everything spoiler free!\nTo keep the game as interactive as possible each account on RLFPS.com will be granted a number of tokens which can be gifted to a player during their stream - similar to the \u2018sponsors\u2019 in The Hunger Games. If you are rooting for one of the players, or perhaps you even know one of them, gifting them a token when they need it most will give them a game specific boost and help them along.\nIf you choose to donate more than \u00a31, your name will be entered into the hat multiple times, increasing your chances of being chosen to play Level 3, but no matter what your donation amount you will have access to all of the exclusive online content.\nCan't use Kickstarter? Visit our site to pledge via Paypal\n We would love to tell you all about what we have in store for you for level 3 - we\u2019re bursting at the seams to let you in on the surprise - but we\u2019re just not gonna spoil it. Here is what we can say\u2026.\nNo more genre-hopping from zombies to aliens and so on - we now have an opportunity to invite you into a vivid, consistent universe with characters and storylines that span multiple installments. We anticipate that the full game will take up to one hour to complete per player, broken up into shorter chapters, probably five 12 minute sections.\nNow that the end goal isn\u2019t a YouTube viral film, the gameplay can slow right down to give you a chance to really explore the world and your options. There will be a heavy focus on interacting directly with other characters and actors in the game, rather than just talking to the guy in the helmet. If you have a great idea for how to solve a problem, convince them to help you.\nBudget allowing, there will be much more interaction that just voice - there are so many new things being developed here, it will leave Levels 1 and 2 in the dust.\nThe team here are more fired up than they have been in years - and we are ready to deliver a rich, living world for you to explore and interact with. We have the best Artificial Intelligence in the industry - because it\u2019s not artificial - there are a dozen real people reacting to each of your decisions in as you make them.\nUltimately the world we can build for you in Level 3 is determined by the number of backers - but trust us when we say, there is a $10m version of Level 3 that would change the face of gaming. The sky really is the limit, and of course anything we don\u2019t get to do with Level 3 will be carried over to Level 4 and beyond.\nRealm is about breaking the rules, and combining cinematic production value with high-concepts on a low budget. It's the unforgettable ideas and stories that get us out of bed in the mornings, and the resourcefulness we have picked up over a decade of indie filmmaking that allows us to pull it all off.\n From the moment we came up with the concept for Level 1, it was clear that our friends at Red House Mysteries would be the perfect collaborators for the RLFPS concept.

Our first campaign was not only successfully funded but it was delivered early!\n\nThere are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Fortunately, we've have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that MetaWear Coin arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.\n\nPlease note that the final look and features of the MetaWear Coin are subject to change based on your feedback and circumstances outside of our control such as component availability.\n\nAs always we expect our backers, supporters, and MetaWear users to comply with the proper regulations and laws.

Click here to visit our online store and buy merch after we ship our rewards to backers!\nOur Story\nThe Mk.II - a 12,000-pound, 15-foot-tall combat robot that needs upgrades for hand-to-hand combat.\nWe are MegaBots, Inc. We challenged Japan to a giant robot duel, and they accepted... but demanded that the fight include hand-to-hand combat. We say BRING IT ON. We've assembled an incredible team of patriots to help us upgrade the Mk.II into the robot America deserves in the world's first giant robot fight, but we need your support to help pay for those upgrades!\nThe upgraded Mk.II concept - the most American robot ever made.\nRight now, the existing Mk.II tops out at 2.5 mph and is built for long-range paintball combat. That means it has thin, destructible armor plates and a mesh canopy. The entire robot's built to be 'lightweight' (if you can call 12,000 pounds light), and hand-to-hand fighting is a whole new level of combat.\nIn order for the Mk.II to survive hand-to-hand combat, we need to\nAdd heavy duty armor plating\nAdd some serious firepower \nUpgrade our hydraulics to handle the heavier armor and firepower \nIncrease our top speed \nUpgrade our power unit to keep up with our new hydraulic system and speed \nThat basic upgrade will cost $500,000. In order to make sure we win the fight, we need to:\nTest a wide range of weapons and choose the best load-out\nKeep our balance during hand to hand combat and not fall over\nNot injure ourselves in the cockpit during combat\nFight with an incredibly sweet paint job. While not strictly required, this is a matter of national pride. \nAll told, a fully upgraded Mk.II will cost $1,500,000. \nTeam USA needs your help now, in order to win this fight. Pledge today to make sure your team takes home the trophy!\nRobot Upgrades\n$500,000: Melee Combat Capability, High Performance Track Base\nMeeting our $500,000 goal means that we get to seriously overhaul the Mk.II. We'll build the ridiculously cool weapon systems you see in our concept art, add the shock-mounted steel armor we need to survive multi-ton punches, beef up our hydraulic actuators to handle the additional weight of our armor and weapons, upgrade our power unit to provide 5x the horsepower to handle the additional power demands of our new hydraulic system, and then work with Howe & Howe Technologies to build a custom track base replacement that'll make us 5x faster than we are now - which will end up making us 2x faster than KURATAS!\n$750,000: Modular Melee & Ranged Weapon Options\nRaising $750,000 will allow us to design and build an array of melee and ranged weapon systems options to help us find the perfect load-out to beat KURATAS. This kind of fight has never happened in real life before - what works at this scale, and what doesn't? This level will help us answer that question. This assortment potentially includes, but isn't limited to, crushing and grasping claws, pile drivers, shields, pneumatically-driven fists, cannons of all shapes and sizes, and flamethrowers (just in case).\n$1,000,000: Dynamic Balancing Algorithm\nAt the end of the day, both the Mk.II and KURATAS are top-heavy. We can practice driving and punching carefully to make sure we don't fall, but right now both robots run the risk of tipping over if they punch or get punched too hard. Raising $1,000,000 will allow us to work with IHMC Robotics, the top-placed U.S. team in the DARPA Humanoid Robotics Challenge, to develop a custom high-end balance control system for the Mk.II so that we can stay upright no matter what happens. This system could EASILY make the difference between falling over after the first punch, and staying upright through the entire match.\n$1,250,000: Life Safety Systems\nRaising $1,250,000 will allow us to engage with NASA - the leaders in the field of keeping humans safe in extreme environments - to see how NASA life safety systems might be used in the cockpit of the Mk.II. We need make sure we can fight as aggressively as possible while also not blacking out from impacts. Safety 4th, folks.\n$1,500,000: Hollywood-Grade Paint Job\nRaising $1,500,000 will allow us to work with FonCo Creative Services to create a Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel to the robot's armor panels. This is America's first giant combat robot - it deserves to look like the million bucks it actually costs!\nWhat You Get  \n$5: Website Shout-out\nFirst and foremost, you get to tell all your friends that you did your patriotic duty to make sure that America snatches the title of World's Best Giant Robot Builders from the hands of the Japanese. How's that for a reward? For $5 we'll put your name on our website as an online memorial to your awesomeness.\n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Media Content and Sticker\n For $10, we'll set you up with a sweet MegaBots logo sticker to feed your vandalism habit, in addition to the shout-out. All backers contributing to this level or more will also get access to the behind the scenes build process via the documentary we're filming!\n$12/15: Pilot the Mk.II In Robocraft\nFor $12 and above, you'll get to own and pilot the Mk.II in Robocraft, a new free-to-play game by Freejam Games that allows you to build your own combat robots from scratch and take them out onto the field of battle! The $12 level is a digital-only level, and comes with your name on our website but doesn't come with a sticker. The $15 level comes with both the Mk.II in Robocraft and a sticker from the $10 level. Any levels above $12 automatically receive the Robocraft unlock code.\n$25: Most Patriotic Poster Ever Created\nThe Mk.II concept art poster\nFor $25 you'll also get a 18\" x 24\" concept art poster celebrating the creation of the most American robot ever made.\n$50: One MegaBots Shirt\nJoin Team USA and show off your home team pride with a crew shirt!\nOur Evolution of Man shirt\nOur SUPER AMERICAN shirt\nFor $50, you'll get to pick from one of three shirts - a crew shirt that shows off your home team pride, an Evolution of Man shirt that celebrates the escalation of combat over the millennia, or our SUPER AMERICAN shirt that confirms that yes, Kogoro Kurata, building something huge and sticking guns on it is, in fact, Super American.\nYou'll choose which shirt and what sizes you want after the campaign's over, in a survey we send to our backers. If you want more than one shirt, feel free to add $35 to any level above $50, per additional shirt!\n$150: 3D Printed MK. II\nUltimate Swag Kit! Including 3D Printed MegaBot\nAt $150, you'll get the collector's edition swag kit - the shout-out, sticker, poster, and shirt, plus a team picture in front of the robot and a 3D printed MegaBot miniature! \n$500: Ultimate Swag Experience\nIf you want the ultimate swag experience, $500 will get you everything in the collector's edition kit, except it'll be boxed and signed by Grant Imahara, the co-founders of BattleBots, the owners of Howe & Howe Technologies, and the MegaBots team! The boxed kit will be a numbered collector's item, so get yours sooner rather than later!\n$250: Demo Day Experience\nCome see the robot and party with us!\nSwag is awesome - but seeing the robot in person is cooler. For $250, you can come to our demo day, see the robot show off its abilities in person, and throw down at a crazy San Francisco party with the founders of MegaBots.\n$750: VIP Demo Day\nYou, too, can hang out with the MegaBros 1-on-1!\n $750 gets you a VIP demo day experience where you ALSO get to sign the robot, take pictures of yourself inside it, and hang out with the robot and founders in a separate, exclusive event.\n$1000/$2,500/$5,000:  MegaBot Pilot/Weapons Testing\nSuit up and pilot the Mk.II!\nFinally, for the ultimate thrill seekers out there, you can suit up and pilot this beast of a robot. $1,000 gets you a ride in the robot as it drives through an obstacle course at top speed. If just riding in the robot isn't enough, $2,500 puts you in the gunner's seat on our shooting range - blow up mock-up KURATAS robots as we drive the robot through a combat simulation. And if that's not enough... $5,000 will put you in the gunner's seat in an exoskeleton that controls the arms and torso of the Mk.II. You get to use a car as a punching bag until the timer's up. On top of all of these experiences, you get the collector's edition swag and a VIP invitation to our demo day.\nYou must be 18 years of age or older by May of 2016 in order to suit up and pilot the robot, and rest assured that you'll have to sign a mile-long waiver that's full of 'YOU MIGHT DIE. NO, SERIOUSLY.'\n$10,000: Pit Crew Experience\nJoin the pit crew!\nLast, but certainly not least, up to 5 lucky people will get to join our pit crew for $10,000. Come along for the ride on the ultimate, once-in-a-lifetime, behind-the-scenes experience as we take this fight to Japan.\nAdvisers\nGrant Imahara, formerly of Mythbusters and Industrial Light & Magic, has joined forces with us to help us design our robot, bring the giant robot duel to the people, and help make giant robot combat a sport in any way he can!\nPeter Diamandis, founder of the X-Prize, is helping us figure out how we can push the state of the art in robotics by using our competition to drive innovation!\nTrey Roski and Greg Munson, founders of BattleBots, have joined up with us to help us figure out the best weapons and strategies for melee combat against KURATAS, and to help us figure out how we can turn this duel into a sport!\nSponsors\nAutodesk has sponsored us from the beginning, supported the creation of the Mk.II, and will be continuing to support us with design software and access to high-end manufacturing equipment throughout this challenge. We can't thank you enough, guys!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk of doing this project is dying in glorious combat, or potentially becoming a national disgrace. The main risk of not doing this project is living in shame, and definitely becoming a national disgrace.\n\nIn all seriousness, any hardware project is difficult to pull off, and a giant robot is way harder than the usual hardware project. What we can say is that we built the Mk.II in 5 months on a shoestring budget - we have the experience and expertise to build robots at this scale, fast. Our partners are literally the best in the business, and have all worked on multi-disciplinary teams before. We have some of the best advisers in the world for what we're doing.

This was far better, and I enjoyed it immensely, as I knew pretty damn well what I was putting my $50 for, and it was money well spent! It seems most of the people complaining jumped on an uniformed bandwagon, but by far most of the people actually keeping track of this through it's development loved it. The Pilots in it is what makes it enjoyable, as it offers a crew view from inside the mech itself, something I've always adored in movies. The only change I would recommend is to have a more defined victory system, as just waiting until the opponent is inoperable or at a safety risk can be a little hard to determine. So if you could have a more set goal for each mech to achieve, then it would increase the tension of the matches. Also, as someone who works with robotic competitions, I have no idea how you're going to manage \"live\", as well as multiple matches. Maybe fights could be a multi day thing, where people come and watch for the first day, and when it's done you fix up the machines for the second day?

With your ideas, feedback, and our learnings, we made an improved coin cell version, which we are super excited to share with the community.\nUsing the user feedback from our first product, we've transformed and improved the original MetaWear platform in just about every way; the tiny form factor is now even smaller, power consumption has been reduced, and we've optimized it to run on a single coin cell battery that doesn't need to be replaced for months!\nSchedule Delivery\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've brought you MetaWear before and we will do it again. Our first campaign was not only successfully funded but it was delivered early!\n\nThere are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Fortunately, we've have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that MetaWear Coin arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.\n\nPlease note that the final look and features of the MetaWear Coin are subject to change based on your feedback and circumstances outside of our control such as component availability.\n\nAs always we expect our backers, supporters, and MetaWear users to comply with the proper regulations and laws.

Setting your Sensorwake is as easy as setting your espresso machine, and changing out the scents is even faster. All this is brought to you by Guillaume Rolland, an 18-year-old French entrepreneur with a vision of making everyone wake up happy!\nEven Google recognizes SensorWake\u2019s potential, awarding it as one of the top 15 inventions \u201cthat can change the world\u201d at the 2014 Google Science Fair.We believe that everyone should wake up happy, relaxed and peaceful, empowered for adventures to come. Happiness lies in the little things, like a great morning, a smell we like, a memory it recalls, a smile it evokes... Together let\u2019s make sure this happens every day!\nOur story began on an early morning over a year ago when 17-year-old Guillaume Rolland couldn\u2019t wake up once again. He hated his noisy alarm clock so much that he decided then and there that he should do something about it.\nOne year later, Guillaume stood in Mountain View where his garage-built prototype placed in the Top 15 \u201cinventions that can change the world\u201d at the 2014 Google Science Fair.\nSince then, Guillaume has assembled a great team of talented and passionate people to make that change a reality. Now 18, and still a part-time engineering student at UTC, Guillaume heads the team and works nightly to achieve his goal of revolutionizing our mornings.\n\"I thought that now, in the 21st century, everyone should have the right to wake up happy, relaxed and peaceful, ready for a great day. So I invented the SensorWake!\" says Guillaume.\nWith the team assembled and partners in place ready to handle the operations, a successful Kickstarter is all Guillaume needs to allow everyone to share the SensorWake experience.\nBorn and raised in France, we grew up with quality smells all around us. That is why we are now happy to work with Givaudan, the world leader in fragrances and flavors. In fact, we\u2019re the first startup they\u2019ve ever chosen to work with.\n\u201cWe are used to working with household brands. But SensorWake represents a great challenge for us. We\u2019ve never done scented capsules for an olfactory alarm clock before!\u201d explains Aur\u00e9lie from Givaudan. \u201cWe truly believe in Guillaume\u2019s product and team. It\u2019s going to change the way we wake up.\u201d\nBut because we know that everyone is unique, we wanted to make sure you have a wide range of scents you can choose from, even at this early stage. As our backers, you\u2019ll be able to choose one of the following two-capsules packs (or more, depending on your pledge). One capsule wakes you up 60 times.\nHere are the two-capsules packs available:\n[NEW] American breakfast: Bacon & Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice\nContinental breakfast: Espresso & Hot Croissant\nCandy Rush: Sweet peach & Strawberry candy \nEnjoy the break: Seaside (monoi, tiare flower) & Lush Jungle (cut grass, leaves)\nInvigorating Aromatherapy: Purifying Tea Tree & Harmonious Chocolate \nVitalization Aromatherapy: Stimulating Ginger & Invigorating Pepper Mint \nVIP lounge (for Kickstarter Backers only): Dollar & Ebony Luxury\nThe patented SensorWake technology releases a scent that\u2019s dosed just right, thanks to its innovative diffusion system. In fact, according to consumer tests we ran on over 100 people, SensorWake will wake you up in under 2 minutes, 99% of the time!\nAnd for the 1% with a stuffy nose, SensorWake includes an audio alarm that goes off after 3 minutes if you\u2019re not awake. That way, you\u2019re never late\u2026 well, at least not because of us!\nSensorWake might sound like a device, but we like to think it\u2019s more. It\u2019s about making your mornings peaceful and happy, and your days smoother and easier to conquer.\nIt took countless hours to bring SensorWake to where it is now, from an original idea to an award-winning product with partnerships around the globe. But we\u2019ve still got a little ways to go. Landing SensorWake on your nightstand will take manufacturing and distribution startup costs, capital for our initial inventory, and additional quality assurance to make sure we\u2019re sending you the best product possible.\nWant to be part of our community? Check out the Backer rewards we developed to make sure you get a fantastic SensorWake experience for your contributions:\nIf you choose to back us, take a look at the table above to see what rewards you can get. You will be invited to choose your packs at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nAfter the launch, you\u2019ll be able to order refills and new capsules on our online store for an estimated $9 each. We\u2019re also doing our best to bring capsules to your favorite local store, so you won\u2019t have to wait for the mailman if you run out.\nTo make your life easier, we plan on setting up our website so you can register to get your favorite sent automatically delivered to your home once every two months. For the nappers out there, you\u2019ll be able to adjust this timing if you use capsules more often.\nYes! Easier to use than your coffee maker, setting up your SensorWake takes just three quick steps:\nAfter setting up the wake up time, insert the scent of your choice.\n Scent diffusion begins at the scheduled time.\nYou will be gently woken up within 2 minutes.\nScent refills are perfectly healthy: they are solvent-free, compliant with IFRA (International Fragrance Association, no allergen), REACH (European Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation, no chemical risks) and CARB standards (California Air Resource Board, healthy air quality).\nAt SensorWake we wanted to make a great device, not only for you, but also for our planet. That\u2019s why we designed it to be durable with high-quality materials to keep them out of landfills. Capsules are also 100% recyclable and free of any VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds).\nFinally, SensorWake fragrances leave no residue whatsoever on surfaces, clothes, or anything else in your room.\nOur team is a mix of youth, creativity, and excellence in engineering. We have experts in several fields, including engineering, marketing and design, and work closely with experts in olfaction and manufacturing, all ready to deliver the best product we can in a reasonable amount of time.\nWe are very proud that our invention has already received awards from prestigious institutions, which inspire us each day to go further.\nWe have tested and built SensorWake so that it\u2019s efficient, safe, and easy to use.

We can re-invent everything right now!\nWhat's Makey Makey GO?\nMakey Makey GO is the World\u2019s First Invention Kit that goes with you everywhere. Makey Makey GO catalyzes the same creativity and ingenuity in creators as the original, award-winning Makey Makey Classic and gives today\u2019s tinkerers, dreamers, and makers even more mobility\u2014allowing them to invent anytime, anywhere.\nMakey Makey GO connecting a banana to laptop. While the look and feel is as simple as peeling a banana, the intricate sensors and circuitry were engineered by PhDs from MIT.\nSmall enough to fit on your keychain, book bag, or bracelet, Makey Makey GO turns everyday objects into touchpads and combines them with the internet. It\u2019s a simple tool-slash-toy that allows beginners and experts to make countless art, music, engineering, and science projects. It comes ready to use out of the box with no setup and no installations. Just plug and play.\nYou Can Wear It or Attach it to Your Stuff\nMake + Key + On the GO = Makey Makey GO!\nBy practicing inventing everywhere with Makey Makey GO you start to gain invention literacy\u2014you become able to \"read\" inventions (understand others' inventions), and you become able to \"write\" inventions (make your own inventions). As with ordinary reading and writing, invention literacy is invaluable even if you never become a professional inventor.\nWhat Can I Make?\nThat\u2019s up to you! The main thing is that Makey Makey GO turns the world into a giant construction kit\u2014because world-changing ideas don\u2019t always happen in a lab or at school. Sometimes they happen in the shower, on the playground, flying a kite, or sitting under an apple tree.\nDonut Spacebar\nIn a Text Editor, Makey Makey GO pushes \"space\" every time you touch the donut\nSlackline Score Keeper\nThe score goes up the longer you stay on the Slackline\nDog-o-Phone\nWhen Puppy touches the foil heart, Skype calls his people so he can say \"Wooof!\"\nSlip'n Selfie\nA High-Five triggers a selfie photo on a tablet as you launch off the ramp into the water\nPlant Harp\nMake a Harp from Palm Fronds, Cardboard and Thumbtacks. Strum the plant harp to trigger sounds and visuals on the laptop.\nFlappy Jello\nGive new meaning to \"Play with your Food.\" Grab some jello out of the fridge, and grab your Makey Makey GO off the fridge door (it's a magnet!). Play a video game by slapping jello.\nHow Does Makey Makey GO Work?\nPlug Makey Makey GO into the USB port of your laptop and then Alligator Clip an object to the Makey Makey GO board. For example, a banana. When you touch the banana the Makey Makey GO sends the computer a keyboard or mouse message. The computer just thinks Makey Makey GO is a regular keyboard or mouse. Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.\nWhat Objects Does it Work With?\nMost materials that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Here are some materials people have used in our workshops: Leaves, aluminum foil, cars, running garden hose, silverware, milk, wet things, alive things, metallic things, graphite, play dough, kitchen sinks, etc. If something won't work, you can make it work for example by applying copper tape or getting them wet.\nFruits, Snacks, Humans, Animals, Cars, Swimming Pools, Coins, and Your Grandma, and Thousands More\nWhat Apps/Webpages Does it Work With?\nIt literally works with any app and any webpage that use a mouse or a keyboard press, which is almost every app or webpage a laptop can run. it just presses keyboard buttons and clicks the mouse. You might try a one button game website, or a music website such as TouchPianist. Use Photobooth or an online webcam program to trigger selfies, and use Powerpoint to advance slides. Launch Skype or FaceTime and hover the mouse arrow over the \"call\" button. Cue up a video on YouTube and trigger it to play with the spacebar or the mouse click. Or use one of the many custom Apps that we have created for you. There are countless possibilities.\nWho is Makey Makey GO For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers, Special Needs Children, Tinkerers, Creators, Dreamers\u2026 Really it is for everyone.\nAge 6 to 101, Kids and Teens Love Makey Makey, but so do Hobbyists and Experts\nWhile Makey Makey GO is playful and easy to use, it packs a lot of power and has a sleek technical design that geeks love.\nRequirements?\nMakey Makey GO works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 & 8, and Mac OSX. It also works with some tablets and mobile devices.\nMakey Makey GO Plugged into a MacBook Pro. By hooking up the traditional pinball machine button to the Makey Makey GO you can play two pinball games at once.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Windows Surface tablet running Windows 8. The score counts how long the person has stayed on the slackline.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Samsung Galaxy running Android using a USB adapter. Cardboard SmartSword is made with a Smartphone, some aluminum foil, and Makey Makey GO. When the sword touches your \"enemy\" you get a point.\nReward Details\nMain Reward: Makey Makey GO Kit\n1 Makey Makey GO - Plug and Play, no assembly, no setup. \n1 beautiful Red Alligator Clip\n1 key ring\nSome stickers\nPrinted instructions with quickstart guide\nOnline apps and documentation\nBonus Rewards\nCollector's Tin - A medium sized red storage tin with Makey Makey designs and logos ($5 value)\nExpansion Pack - Spool of copper tape, extra long alligator clip, long extension wire ($10 value)\nT-Shirt - A High Quality American Apparel Makey Makey T-Shirt ($15 value)\nMakey Makey Classic - The original Makey Makey that started it all ($50 value)\nWhy Did You Create Makey Makey GO?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits.\nWe redesigned Makey Makey Classic to focus it down to its absolute bare essentials: a single capacitive sensor input with a single alligator clip that can pretend to be any key or a mouse click. Then we gave it a magnet, a keyring, and shrunk it down so small that it fits anywhere. The result is something that can always GO with you and that is unbelievably simple to use. It's the size of a USB thumb drive and just as easy to plug and play. \nWe designed Makey Makey GO to feel more like a kitchen gadget or a multi-tool and less like a traditional circuit.\nMakey Makey GO stuck to a fridge door magnetically is just one example of how Makey Makey GO is always within grasp.\nMakey Makey Classic \nIn 2012 we created, Kickstarted and delivered (early) the original Makey Makey, and it was named Best of Kickstarter. It has now gone into the hands of 200,000 inventors and delighted millions of others.\nMakey Makey Awards and Press\nThe Makey Makey Classic was named one of Consumer Reports\u2019 \u201cBest Tech Toys of 2014\u201d and one of Popular Science's \u201cBest of Toy Fair (2014).\u201d In addition, Makey Makey Classic was recently inducted into the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s (MoMA) permanent collection.\nTED Talk on Makey Makey \n\"I used to want to design a utopic society, or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm getting older I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be 7 billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic, coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's a world I really want to live in.\"\nWho are we?\nTodd Eddie, Jay Silver, David ten Have, and Rachel Silver.\nJay Silver leads JoyLabz and recently came out of MIT Media Lab and Intel. Dave ten Have, COO, co-founded the first cloud 3D printing company, Ponoko, and is an awesome Hacker. Todd Eddie, our VP, is a climber, and he's a Georgia Tech electrical engineer. Rachel Silver, our Logistics Goddess, studied visual arts at Sarah Lawrence and Reed College and is a gardening guru. Liam Nilsen, who is a lifelong unschooler, joined most recently to handle social media \u2014 he also runs the Endor project. \nWe all collaborated from across the globe to bring Makey Makey GO into existence. As Dave said the day before launching the Kickstarter, \"I think I just realized that I am living in the future. I live in New Zealand, but here I am in Cocoa Beach riding an electric bamboo/carbon-fiber bike, made by a friend out of local bamboo and left over carbon fiber, to UPS to overnight prototypes of an invention kit the size of my thumb that didn't even exist until 2 weeks ago to people all over the world. I am my childhood self's superhero.\"\nSo many people contributed to Makey Makey GO that they can't all be listed here. Please see the about page for credits. Eric Rosenbaum co-invented Makey Makey Classic with Jay. Makey Makey would not be possible without the input of literally thousands of people. We are so grateful! \nContact\nKickstarter Questions - Contact us through Kickstarter \nGeneral Questions - support@joylabz.com\nPR contact - jon@joylabz.com\nPress Page \nFine print: Copyright JoyLabz LLC \u00a9 2015.

However, the reality is that we are more dependent on audio jacks for our computers, phones and tablets than ever before.  We use this technology everywhere we go, and the unfortunate fact is that the audio jack has not stayed up-to-date to the demands placed on it today.\nThis dilemma is the \"spark\" that got it all started as we (Jon and Jeff) sat down over a cup of coffee...\n... dreaming of what the world might look like with an improved audio connection solution. That is where our passion started and it has only grown as we get closer to making our dream a reality.\nOur hope is that in some small way, you will be excited about this Kickstarter campaign, and you will believe in this vision and decide to join the MAGZET revolution. And if you do decide to join us, you will be the proud owner of a MAGZET before it land in stores! This is especially important for our backers in countries outside of the United States that may not always have immediate access to the new technologies \u2013 with your backing you will get the MAGZET at the same time as everyone else.\nReported by:\n                              Our Solution\nYes! MAGZET will bring innovation to the audio connection with the power of magnetic technology\u2026\nThe MAGZET Magnetic Technology in the Middle\nThink about it, if we add magnetic technology in the middle (and we did with the MAGZET!), we can keep all the accessories and devices and that we already invested in and make them...\nMAGkap and MAGjack\n\"Snap\" connect enabled \u2013 The magnet technology conveniently pulls them together in a \u201csnap\u201d and auto-aligns even in dark environments without specific visual focus.\nMore reliable \u2013 Once the MAGkap (the side you plug into the audio cable) and MAGjack (the side you plug into the device) is installed, the device\u2019s jack and your audio cable are protected from wear-out.\nSafer \u2013 The magnetic technology breakaway feature protects your ears, headphones, accessories, or even worse, your device from being catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and inconvenient consequences.\nWhat's so wrong with the traditional audio jack?\nWe have all experienced the flaws of the audio jack as we know it today...\nInconvenient - We have to \u201cvisually\u201d focus and locate a small hole to slide things together, which is difficult to do while driving or in certain situations such as in a dark room, or while device is in a handbag or backpack.\nFragile - The audio plug has been known to breakoff in a device\u2019s jack and/or the device\u2019s audio jack or cable as been known to wear-out and stop working.\nCostly/Painful - Pull on the audio or headset cable from a bad angle and devices have been known to be catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and painful consequences to your devices, and your ears, head, or other body parts.\nOpen Jack - With the audio jack remaining open when headphones are not in use, dirt, debris, and moisture can work its way into the jack, impacting performance.\nWhere can I use it?\nConnecting to all your audio devices and accessories becomes simple and smooth. You can use your MAGZET with your phone, computer, tablet, headphones, stereo systems, even your car auxiliary input... pretty much any place you want an easier and safer way to connect your audio. You will want to have several, for maximum audio device and accessory versatility.\nWill all my current audio features still work? What about sound quality?\nYes! We took the design time and have run tests to make sure the MAGZET functions correctly with all your favorite devices, including Apple and Android-based models. You will still be able to answer calls, use the mic, adjust volume and skip tracks via the cable inline controls when using the MAGZET. The audio quality is preserved as we use the highest quality materials and manufacturing processes that one would expect from a high-end audio accessory.  Whether you\u2019re using your favorite phone, tablet, headphones, or computer, we have made sure that your device\u2019s functionality, audio quality, and features will continue to work just as you have always experienced with your wired solution.\nWhat about Bluetooth headsets?  Aren't they the future?\nThe apparent freedom of going wireless with Bluetooth seems like a nice option. However, it can be incredibly cumbersome to have to work through the pairing process and have a whole additional device that requires battery monitoring and charging. The MAGZET does not have these limitations, and it also works with devices that do not have Bluetooth functionality \u2013 all you need is that internationally ubiquitous audio jack that has been around for decades, well before Bluetooth was invented. If you need a wireless based solution there is certainly a place for Bluetooth, but it is not at some disadvantages and shortcomings compared to the wired audio quality and \"it just works\" convenience of the MAGZET.\nCan I really leave my MAGjack in all the time?\nYes, we wanted you to leave your MAGjack in so we invented a means to accomplish this! Normally when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality. Our technology counters the normal behavior and ensures that the MAGjack alone is not detected and the phone only detects the MAGjack when the MAGkap is connected.\nCan I really trust that you can build this thing?\nThis is certainly a fair question! The good news is that Jon is an award-winning technology innovator who has commercialized dozens of products with a deployment of over 5 million devices worldwide. Additionally, Jon has built-up a network of relationships over years of domestic and Far East business dealings and travels that will be leveraged on this project. \n\nAll this to say, you can be assured that the MAGZET will be built to a world-class quality level and that we have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise.\nHOW YOUR BACKING DOLLARS WILL BE USED...\nThere are several tasks yet to be completed.  Please watch the following video to see how your backing dollars will make them possible.\nPLAY\n\nSo, that\u2019s where we stand. We have a fairly user-friendly prototype (as featured in the video). However, our design still needs to be miniaturized (made smaller), custom tooled, and ramped up in manufacturing.\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!!!\nThese last steps are expensive, and we are asking YOU to please help us take MAGZET across the finish line. And in so doing... joining the MAGZET revolution of changing how the world plugs audio things together!\nHow do I back this campaign?\nBacking MAGZET on Kickstarter is simple and secure - and open to everyone around the world.\nLog into your Kickstarter account, or create a new account. \nClick the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top of this page. \nEnter your pledge amount and select one of the reward levels.

For those of you who select a reward level with t-shirts, an e-mail will be sent to you after the completion of our successful funding campaign, asking for your t-shirt(s) design (A or B) and size (M, L, XL, or 2X) selections. The selected t-shirt(s) will be shipped to you in advance of the delivery of the MAGZET product.\n3 Promises to Our Backers...\n1. Give Back - We owe a debt of gratitude to the Kickstarter community and promise to support other projects and even your own projects. Just let us know about them! We hope that our project inspires others.\n2. Proactive Communication - We will proactively communicate to our faithful backers the good, bad, or otherwise, as it unfolds. You are in this with us!\n3. Environmentally Responsible - To the extent possible, we will be a good steward to the world around us, even if it costs us a little more. We have a long-term perspective, and the environment will remain a part of our decision-making paradigm.\n*** PLEASE KEEP SCROLLING FOR A DEEPER DIVE INTO DESIGN/RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ***\nDesigned with a \"Simplicity\" Focus\nIf there is one word that sums up the MAGZET \u2013 it would be simplicity. On the outside, the Series1 looks clean and simple, and the user experience is just as easy... just \"snap\" the MAGkap and MAGjack together, and you are off and running \u2013 i.e. it just works!  However, the most simplistic of user experiences is realized by a level of \"sophistication under the covers,\" which we will continue to dive into with the next section.\n\"Simplicity\" the Ultimate Sophistication\nResearch and Development\nAs in any entrepreneurial invention, the idea is the easy part; the hard part is the actual realization of that idea into a tangible solution that people would really find valuable and be willing to purchase.\nSo, we got to work over a year ago, pulling off many late nights. We researched by tearing into numerous devices, including Apple and Android based models.  We analyzed various magnetic strengths and tested early prototype concepts, improving each design iteration, with a plugfest with real people and devices.\nHere is just a small snapshot of the work we have completed from a Research and Development perspective, to give you a taste of what we have been up to.\nThe MAGkap and MAGjack\nBoth the MAGkap and MAGjack are designed for easy use and consist of quality components to make sure you experience the high fidelity sounds you expect from a great audio accessory.  \n\"We designed to the standards of a product we would be thrilled to use in our own daily lives.\"  \nThe design gives you a 360 degree solid connection, while still having the added benefit of magnetic breakaway protection.  The graphic below cycles through several of the MAGkap and MAGjack design iterations we explored through the design process.\nEngineering and Testing\nWhen we said we literally tore into jacks we were serious!  The graphics below shows 10 very popular devices\u2019 audio jacks from several vendors that we analyzed by cross-sectional cutout (by hand filing!) to determine their inner workings.\nThe analysis was key in determining a (patent pending) means to overcome the challenge that when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality, even if the MAGkap was not installed.\n\"We want you to leave your MAGjack in and needed to invent a means to achieve that - which we did!\"\nMagnetic Strength\nAs one would expect, a product based on magnetic technology required considerable magnetic analysis and design effort. We needed to determine the optimal magnetic strength for both holding under normal use and for the magnetic breakaway protection features.  \n\"It took us months to zero into the optimal magnetic strength after testing dozens of magnetic materials and shapes.\"  \nThe fun video below illustrates the magnetic holding force on the prototype concept shown above.\nPLAY\n\nNote: The video\u2019s audio track is that of our co-founder (Jeff) showing off his mad electric guitar skills!\nLatest Prototype\nThe latest prototype is shown in the graphic below. It has yet to be miniaturized (made smaller) and does not display the final color scheme. The prototype was rapid-prototyped through the use of 3D metal printing and CNC machining processes and was hand assembled.\nOUR STORY\nAfter spending the last 15 years working in the IT Industry, I (Jeff) left my job looking to do something different. One day, I was sitting in a local coffee shop and ran into a friend of mine named Jon Hallsten. Jon was closing one chapter of his career and was considering starting a new innovative product design company. We started talking about coming up with a gadget idea that we could take to market and had mass market appeal.\nThat's how the concept of the MAGZET product got started. Being a guitar player for the last 40 years, I mentioned that it seems crazy that we still plug things in and out to connect to devices, i.e. guitar amps, headphones, etc. Jon agreed, and that\u2019s what got us working on the product!\nSpecial Thanks to: Raymond Bugelski, Steve Chiles, Rodney Ross, John Buchanan, Paul Evans, Adam Rissmiller, Matt Orley, Shane Sevo, Scott Foster, Bob Martinez, Jay Yoo, Jon Fawcett, Kyle Crocker, Ken Burns, Vince Fisher and Zach Beaver for their expertise in support of this project.  All the talented people at Orca for all their hard work and design assistance.  All the trailblazing entrepreneurs on Kickstarter, whose campaigns we watched and learned from.  And most importantly, we are so grateful to our beautiful wives, Denise Hallsten and Lisa Russell, for putting up with our long nights and for their support of our dream.  We are humbled that you believe in our mission and are confident that together we can make MAGZET a reality and ultimately change how the world plugs audio things together!  Again, thanks to all of you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest technical challenge to overcome was the fact that when one plugs a connector into a phone's audio jack, the phone thinks something is plugged in and re-routes the audio to headset functionality. The good news is that we invented (patent pending) a solution to fix that problem when just the MAGjack is installed and the Series1 does not have this shortcoming.\n\nTechnical Risk\n\nHowever, our technical challenges are far from over. We all know the benefits of miniaturization. This will be especially important in a MAGjack design that is intended to be left in a device. We want to shrink the MAGZET so that it protrudes less, and has room for the magnet (with enough strength), the landing pad, and the inter-connect contact points required. Definitely a design trade off!\n\nAnother significant challenge we have is that the nature of our design requires numerous, very intricate sub-pieces, which are hard to manufacture and require expensive tooling. We must not only shrink the design, but reduce its complexity and ensure that it can be reliably manufactured over volume! That is not easy...\n\nIn light of the challenges above, our timeline could be affected if we cannot solve them in a timely manner. Should we miss our technical deadlines, we\u2019ll let you know why (per Backer Promise #2) and make it right as quickly as possible.\n\nForecasting Risk\n\nOnce we get a flavor for the popularity of our campaign, we will do our best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan timeline. We've learned a lot from our years of bringing products to market, but sometimes, despite our best intentions, forecasts don\u2019t always hit the mark. Should we miss our projections, we\u2019ll let you know why (per Backer Promise #2) and take corrective action immediately.\n\nSupply Chain Risk\n\nWe\u2019ve built a network of manufacturing relationships with very capable teams over the years of building products. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed (per Backer Promise #2) and work to quickly solve the problem.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWhile every attempt was made in this campaign to use final design intent representations, we realize that during the miniaturization and build out process the MAGZET may have to be slightly altered in appearance and/or performance. We reserve the ability in good faith to make these changes if needed.\n\n*** Bottom Line *** \n\nWe know what it will take to bring the MAGZET to market, just as we have with numerous other products (actually over 5 million shipped devices worldwide) through the course of our careers. We have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "MAGZET - Jon Hallsten & Jeff Russell\nFirst created \u00b7 19 backed\nHi All, We are Jeff Russell and Jon Hallsten and we live in the Akron, Ohio area.

It's a new type of gaming experience that combines the tangible and social pleasure of a board game with the interactive and adaptable mechanics of a video game. The game is for 2 to 4 players and features a Large, two part, high quality board that represents the minutely detailed world of Yo-Ho. At the same time, a free downloadable app turns your smartphone into a ship. Simply place your phone on the board and set sail for adventure!\nBecome the most famous pirate of Yo-Ho, a parallel world teeming with intelligent animals, lost islands and wild magic! The call to adventure echoes throughout this land, and although life on the high seas is a dangerous game, for those that truly embrace the pirate spirit the promise of glory is worth any risk. Will you sink...or will you sail?\nClassic: It\u2019s a free-for-all! Be the first player to reach a certain number of Swag points (aka victory points).\nCampaign:  Take part in the first chapter of the World of Yo-Ho saga : War of the Orchids. Each session is tied into a plot that will immerse you in the Yo-Ho universe.\nSingle Phone/Tablet: If you don't have enough devices for all the players, you can also play World of Yo-Ho with only one device, or even a tablet. In this case, cardboard tokens that represent ships and captains are included in the box version. The device is not on the map but is passed from player to player, and each player is responsible for updating his ship's position when he moves.\nCruise: This single player mode allows you to sail the seas of Yo-Ho, learning all about this magical world. It is also a quick way to understand how the devices move around the board.\nPorts are temporary hideouts where you can resupply, regroup and prepare your strategy. Being in a port allows you to:\nBuy weapons and items for use in combat\nPurchase upgrades for your captain and your ship\nAccept a large variety of missions\nRepair your ship\nCheck on how well the other players are doing and if someone is close to victory!\nBehold a selection of some of the fine weaponry you'll be able to unleash upon your ennemies! Are you more of a broadsides or cutlass kind of corsair?\nThat scallywag swagger may impress the girls back home but you're going to need a lot more flair then that if you want to make it to the top. Luckily these upgrade items will help get your captain and his ship looking suitibly fine!\nWord gets around fast in the World of Yo-Ho, especially if parrots are involved. When you depart from a port, it's not hard for other captains to find out what you did there. So if you don\u2019t want your opponents to know what items you bought or what missions you chose that could interfere with theirs, you\u2019d better lighten your Clams chest and leave the port incognito.  \nThere are many different kinds of missions, ranging from simple cargo transportation to searching for sunken treasure in monster infested seas.\nCompleting missions will not only make you rich but also bring you closer to victory. But beware, if you do not respect your contract, you could find yourself with a bounty on your head, something other players won't hesitate to cash in on!\nMissions are randomly generated for every game and evolve depending on each player's actions.\nAnother way to earn Swag points is to fight your opponents, whether you have a reason to or not!\nYou can attack a player if your devices are on adjacent tiles. Touch the attack button on his phone and the swashbuckling can begin!\nWhen combat begins, both players take their phones and secretly program their actions (with items bought whilst at port).\nThe amount of items you can play depends on the flag that you run up the mast. If either of the participants is flying a white flag then your options are limited. If both ships are flying the Jolly Roger however, you're in for one hell of a fight!\nOnce this is done, players put their phone back on the map, and everyone can witness the results as they are animated on screen!\nIn addition to earning Swag points, the winner can pillage items from his opponent. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound!\nWhile sailing the seas of Yo-Ho, weather conditions can change or a monster may rise from the depths. You could find an old wreck filled with sunken treasure or simply a message in a bottle bobbing along the waves\u2026 \n Smartphone technology allows us to bring the World of Yo-Ho to life. This world remembers, it be good deeds or foul play. Missions and Events are not chosen randomly, criteria such as your position on the board, where others are, whether you are ahead in the game or falling behind, whether you play aggressively or passively, all this information is used to make sure every player has his or her fair share of the adventure! The mission system is procedural, and will generate written descriptions based in the game's setting. By changing variables ( destination, time required, objectives, \u2026 ), every mission will be a new and original challenge. \nThere's is no freeloading either! Some missions will be rarer and have more interesting rewards than others, but no matter the mission, rewards will be proportional to the effort required to complete them : a mission sending you to the other corner of the board will be much more rewarding than one sending you two tiles away from where you are. Think you can earn some quick clams easily without being noticed ? Well, rumours spread fast in the World of Yo-Ho, and unless you bribe your way out of the harbour, other players might learn of your plans, race you for the reward, or even earn some clams by preventing you from doing so ! And don\u2019t think you can go back on a deal either! Some would be all too hasty to call on other players to exact some just vengeance for them!\nMany monsters live in the waters of Yo-ho. Some lairs even span across multiple zones, and they will be more then happy to pop up and disrupt your game should you cross their territory. Some will require a collaborative effort, and multiple rounds of combat to defeat. You can choose to ignore them (not always easy when I giant see serpent is bearing down on you), but every hit will be rewarded with well-earned swag points and recorded by the game, provided you don\u2019t ridicule yourself of course! However, only the player that deals the final blow will get to plunder the beast's horde, so some strategy may be required. A slain monster will of course stay dead until the end of the game. \n This memory can span further than just one game too. In campaign mode, each chapter (game) has multiple endings depending on the choices made by you and your fellow players. As you play through each chapter, your story will continue to grow and evolve, always based on the consequences of your actions! Perhaps an ally you made in a previous game gives you the option to sack a port, removing it from future games. However, another ally that has been with you since you first set sail may disagree with your actions and withdraw their support. This is just one example of how this dynamic world can adapt. You are the hero, it's your story to create! Here's a video to show just how vibrant we have made this world, you'll soon understand how the use of devices can bring so much more life to your tabletop games!\nWhether they rose to power through cunning, strength of arms or just blind luck, the life of a pirate is not known to cultivate the most balanced of individuals! But a few faults here and there isn't that big a deal, after all, nobody's perfect right?\nSome would call nailing a man o' war to the back of a giant swordfish madness. In the world of Yo-Ho it's pretty much par for the course. These giants of the sea have linked their fates to that of their chosen captain, for better or for worse!\nSmartphones are now an everyday object, so why not use them whilst playing a boardgame? Having small but powerful computers on a board can add a lot to your gaming experience. \nWe designed World of Yo-Ho based on the following principles: \nThese devices can calculate where they are on the board and communicate with one another.\nHaving a digital screen on top of the map allows you to bring it to life with animations and sound effects.\nSetting up your game is fast and easy. A few clicks and you're ready to go.\nYour phone can tell if it is being held up and display different information or let you input secret orders.\nYou can pause and resume your game anytime thanks to the game's autosave feature.\nJust like in a board game, random events can occur, however, thanks to the digital element, the game evolves and reacts according to the players actions.\nWorld of Yo-Ho Rules PDF (work in progress)\nMoving the phone on the board\nSo, how do the phones know where they are on the board ?\nThe board is composed of tiles, 6x10 exactly. The game first tells you where to put your phone, and then you can move it from tile to tile. It analyzes in which direction you moved it and understands where it currently is.\nAdding life to a static board\nThe screen displays a representation of the board underneath it and adds several elements as well. Your boat bobs along in the sea, waves are generated by the wind whilst birds and clouds fly across the screen. On top of that, UI elements give you the control of this living map.\nYou'll notice that we take into account the physical size of the screen in order to display the map as if you were looking through it.\nPhone Orientation\nDifferent types of information are displayed whether the phone is on the board or being held by someone.\nWhen your phone is on the board, it displays information regarding the tile it\u2019s on. These details are public and may be of interest to other players (to help them complete a mission for example).\nWhen you hold your phone up it shows private information relevant to your captain and ship. Only you can see its screen, so you can secretly consult your ship's hold or your active missions in order to prepare your strategy.\nYou think you know everything about pirates? Ah, the impertinence of youth... Make yourself useful, pour me another and I will tell you a tale of the Nine Seas\u2026\nYo-Ho is not only a world, it\u2019s a dimension folded into a single piece of worn parchment. Is its withered surface paper or human flesh? Nobody knows for sure but this is a minor conundrum compared to the secrets sealed inside this faded map. Legends say that the demon known as Davy Jones crafted it or maybe, that it was somehow\u2026 part of him. Who knows how old it is? It's impossible to retrace its history as it has spent the centuries being passed, stolen or traded from one persons hoard to another.\nThen \"she\" came to Yo-Ho. Her name was Hortense. She was, as she put it, \u201cHuman\u201d. She claimed : \u201cYo-Ho is a magical map, and I am the pirate who found it. I came here to be Queen of the high-seas\u201d. At the time we were only animals. Eating, sleeping, going on with our simple lives. Then Hortense shared her secrets with a parrot, and the parrot, in turn, shared them with us. We started talking, using our paws, paddles, and eating Koko. We took a liking to the pirate life. Hortense created the Sisterhoods and leaders arose. All around us armies were raised and nations were born. We learnt fast. We were restless. We hungered for glory.\nIn Yo-Ho, Pirates are as much a part of their boats, as their boats are part of them. We call this unity Biots. Massive colossus roam these seas, whales, giant jellyfish, and ancient turtles, and we learnt to communicate with them. We pitched our might against each other, brother against sister, in a perpetual fight to win the heart of our unique Goddess, Hortense in her beautiful regalia of flowers, these mysterious orchids she was so fond of. We made this place a heaven for feathered felons and scaly scallywags. It was our world to make and in it we saw only glory, fame and precious clams.\nWe became more than human. Better: we became pirates.\nBut today, as I write these words, Hortense is dead. Nobody knows who killed her. Her lieutenants found her on her island, executed on a golden beach, clutching one last orchid in her delicate hand.\nNow everything is changing. New chieftains are rising from our ranks. Silent forces are working in the shades of twisted palm trees, where mutant birds scream in the canopy. A foul wind is blowing in from the north. Its nefarious aura can be felt by all, from hardy deck hands to sea sick greenhorns. Dark portents manifest throughout the oceans: in the breaking of the waves, in the clouded skies, and among the many perils that lie just off the shore. A tide of darkness is rising in this world.\nDo you hear the roars from under the sea ? Do you see our skies torn apart by strange lights, to the pulse that is the lifeblood of this land ? Something is waking up. Something Hortense was shielding us from. What will we do once it awakens?\nAll backers will receive a free upgrade to their game board with a limited edition Kickstarter design!\n *Le Dernier Bar Avant la Fin du Monde is Paris most popular social spot for geek culture. From board games, films, mangas, video games and much more, chances are you'll always find something that interests you here! They also serve some cracking food and drink of course! Please note: Transport is not included in this pledge.\nCaptain Figureheads - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach $55k we'll add figureheads for the 4 original captains plus any others unlocked during the campaign. These allow you to easily distinguish each player's device and character whilst on the board as well as adding some more light hearted fun to the game! These are small, Silicone models that attach to your device via a suction cup. They will be included in the boxed version of the game (captain pledge level and upwards).\nShip Figureheads - UNLOCKED!\nNote: Example using a similar product.\nJust like for the captains, if we reach $60k we will add figureheads for the 4 original vessels plus any unlocked during the campaign! They will be included in the boxed version of the game (captain pledge level and upwards).\n$60,000 - New Captain and Ship\n Our first digital stretch goal will unlock a brand new Captain AND Ship for the game, each with their own unique ability. Plus we have so many ideas for them we thought we'd let YOU decide what you'd prefer. After the campaign we will send out a survey and you guys can vote on your favourite idea! This is an upgrade for the App and will therefore be available to all pledge levels. Models and figureheads will of course be produced for these newcomers if the stretch goals are met.\n$65,000 - Boat models   \nThis stretch goal will add plastic models representing the ships in the game as well as a detatchable sail to represent each of the captains. These are a fantastic addition for those of you wanting to play in single device mode. These models will replace the cardboard silhouettes present in the box set (so captain pledge levels and upwards). Here's a quick example of what we have planned. The models will be about 5cm tall and 6cm long. They will be supplied unpainted.\n$70,000 - Captain Models  \nAs with the previous pledge level, this will add plastic models representing the captains to box set (so captain level pledge and upwards). The model are about 5cm tall and will be supplied unpainted.

We didn't want to launch a Kickstarter campaign before we were sure we could build our idea into a working project. The biggest challenge was bringing our vision of a boardgame with digital support to life. How would it play? How could it make a board game better? Would it ultimately enhance the player's gaming experience and immersion? We are now sufficiently advanced on the project to know it works, and it is fun. So though technically we are not starting the game and we have an advanced working prototype, now is the time to try and make it real thanks to Crowdfunding on Kickstarter by appealing to the extraordinary community of this wonderful site.\niOS\niPod Touch 3rd generation or higher\niPhone 3GS or higher\niPad 2 or higher (only in single device mode)\niOS 5.1.1 or higher\nAndroid\nbetween 3.5 inch and 5.0 screen\nAndroid 2.3 or higher\nAccelerometer\nTablet (only in single device mode)\nCommon\nWifi connexion (one of the phones can be a hotspot)\nThe device must pysically fit within a 5.7\" x 3\" zone for optimum performance.\nExamples\nTHE PUBLISHER \nIELLO is an international game and toy publisher and distributor founded in 2004 in Nancy, France.

Prizm streams music directly from the Cloud so you don\u2019t even need to use a phone or a computer. You can now discover and enjoy more music with a single hit of a button.\nPrizm enhances your everyday life through music\n\"You just have to press the play button and that\u2019s it\"\n\"What the Nest does for the temperature, Prizm does for the music in your house: It learns what you like and adjusts the environment to suit your needs.\"\n\"Prizm could be the Hi-Fi of the future automated home.\"\n\"Prizm\u2019s contextual approach is pretty clever.\"\n\"Prizm learns to play only music you want to hear.\"\n\"Prizm\u2019s product is slick, and, having seen it in person and played with it, I can tell you that the product just works.\"\nPress play and the music starts. Music streams directly from the cloud to your speakers. You will no longer have to use your smartphone, computer or any other device to enjoy music. No more browsing, bluetooth pairing or any kind of hacky setup.\nPrizm is even smarter, it can also start music as soon as it detects you in the room !\nThanks to the signals from your phone and wearables (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), added to a sound level sensor, Prizm knows what is happening in the room. Not only does it identify who is in the room, it can also sense what is the current atmosphere (chilling with friends, working etc.).\nIf you are alone, Prizm plays music for you. If your companion is alone, it plays music for him/her. And if you are together in the room, it merges both of your tastes and picks a song both of you will love. \nPrizm doesn't only suggests new songs based on your tastes. It knows what you like but also understands when and in which context you like specific music. Because we know that you don't listen to the same music alone or with friends, in the morning and after work, Prizm's music recommendation is driven by the context.\nWhen you discover something great, just touch the heart to add the song directly into your own playlists (Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer). So when you leave home, songs you just discovered are already on your phone.\nPLAY\n\nDemo : press the heart and the song is added directly into your playlists\nEach time you interact with Prizm, it learns. Everyday, Prizm remembers your habits and learns that you prefer pop music in the morning, and jazz when you\u2019re back from work.\nDon\u2019t think about what you want to listen to anymore. Just enjoy music you\u2019ll love and live your life.   \nWhy buy another speaker ? You probably already have at home a great sound system or speakers that fit your needs. Prizm works with whatever speakers you prefer and breathes new life in what you already own.\nPrizm connects to your Spotify or Deezer Premium account to stream music. It also supports Soundcloud free accounts. This way, you can enjoy Prizm without any paid subscription !\nWe are working hard to make Prizm compatible with your favorite music streaming services in the future. Let us know which one you would like to be supported next.\nA Prizm device needs only one account to stream music. This account is used as the music source but you can create as many Prizm profiles as you want. This way, everyone at home can enjoy Prizm with its own profile.\nPrizm will also implement an UPnP MediaRenderer. This means that whenever you want to listen to something specific that is stored on a compatible NAS or any DLNA Server, you'll be able to stream it to your speaker through Prizm. However, you will still need a Deezer, Spotify or SoundCloud account to experience the best of Prizm, that is to generate a contextual music feed and discover new songs.\nPrizm captures Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals from your phone or wearables to identify you through your MAC address. During the setup, you just have to match your device to your Prizm profile. Thus, when Prizm senses your device, it knows you\u2019re around ! \nPLAY\n\nPart of the algorithm runs on the device, the other is in our cloud. For instance, music recommendation which requires a huge music catalog is computed instantly in the cloud. Because your profile is also stored in the cloud, you can go to a friend's who owns a Prizm, and you'll be identified by his Prizm ! Your music profile follows you around.\nPrizm will ship with some extra cool features :\nYou can set Prizm to wake you up in the morning : it'll pick a new song everyday to help you start a better day.\nSimilarly, Prizm can gradually go to sleep as you do so. This means that you won't have to fall asleep with the music on, or make sure it's off before you go to bed.\nPrizm was designed to be standalone and always ready to use. However, we built a companion app for the device\u2019s setup and to allow remote control. If you hear an amazing song, you will be able to Like it even from the bathroom ! For the moment, this app is iOS and Android compatible, but more OS will come.  \nWith Prizm, we wanted to break the rules of traditional Hi-Fi design. The two main buttons express fundamental human emotions : when you hear a song, you either like it, or you don't. This obvious interface serves the underlying learning algorithm.\nThe design itself reflects that Prizm is a thinking device, and not a simple Wi-Fi dongle.\n\nPrizm will also be available in 3 of these extra colors ! Backers will vote for their favorite after the campaign :\nWe are a bunch of hardware and software passionates and fervent music streaming users. Fed up with having to figure out what to listen to all day long, and having to connect our phones or laptop to our speakers to decently enjoy music at home, we set out to build the music system of our dreams.\n\nFor over 18 months, we've have built, coded, designed, prototyped to bring our vision to life. \n \nThe board is running a Linux OS on an ARM Cortex A8 at 1Ghz with 256MB RAM.\n\nPrizm software will evolve and bring new features. We'll listen to you. Updates will be seamlessly pushed to your devices, without you having to care about it.\n\nMany of you picture Prizm larger than it actually is. All those who have seen it in real life were pleased to see its real size, and how cute it was. So here is a picture in comparison with an old relative of Prizm : a CD.\n\n  Thank you !\n\nWe would like to personally thank all of you for your support.\n\nSpecial thanks to Antebellum Films for their dedicated work on the video and Orange for their support on the manufacturing process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a hardware product is hard, and once in your hands it must last.

Preorder TinyScreen here \nLook who's talking about TinyScreen (read them all here)\nTinyScreen is the new way to visualize your environment. With a beautiful color OLED display, TinyScreen is designed to be used to display information from the TinyDuino platform, which stack together like little electronic Lego's.\nWith TinyScreen there are several default apps that will work right out of the box - like a Smart Watch app, a Video player app and a video game app.  You can use these default apps with NO PROGRAMMING AT ALL!\nSMART WATCH\nCreate your own smart watch using TinyScreen.  The watch can be configured to use several different watch faces, and can use Bluetooth 4 (also known as Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Smart) to communicate with your smart phone (Android 4.3+ and iOS 7+).  \nWe have an open source app developed for both iPhone and Android that will allow you to configure the notifications that you can receive and display on the watch, like incoming phone calls, incoming texts, tweets and appointments.\n 3D printed enclosures are also available for the watch body that you can download and print yourself, and we'll also have different enclosures that you can purchase.\nPLAY GAMES\nPlay games on your TinyScreen, either with the four buttons along the side of the screen, or with the new Joystick TinyShield.  This supports two analog joysticks.  Currently we have a Flappy Bird clone and asteroids, with many more games to come.  Plus with the open source software library, other Kickstarter backers can create games and share them on our website.  \nWATCH VIDEOS\nWatch videos on your TinyScreen which can stream from an attached microSD card.  The videos can be any length, and a simple menu system that uses the TinyScreen buttons lets you navigate and select the video from the SD card.\nThe video format is similar to an animated GIF and computer software is available to convert standard videos into this format.\nREWARD LEVELS\nCREATE YOUR OWN PROJECTS\nLightning Fast Arduino Library\nWe've written an Arduino library from scratch for the TinyScreen that is optimized for speed and performance, yet still is very easy to use.  Full screen updates can be done in under 30 milliseconds, allowing for smooth moving videos and graphics. \nCreating your own TinyScreen projects is simple and the library includes high level functions for dealing with fonts and text, menus, graphics, gauges and basic shape.  Just a couple of lines of code are needed in most cases to start displaying what you want on your TinyScreen.  The library is completely open source.\nWeb Based Programming\nWe've teamed up with Codebender - the leading web based platform for the Arduino - to make programming your TinyScreen projects simple.  All of the latest TinyScreen libraries, examples, and standalone apps will be available on Codebender, This means you don't have to worry about getting your system set up just right with the specific libraries installed - all of this is handled on the Codebender site so you can focus on creating on your TinyScreen project,\nAny sharing code on Codebender is simple as well, so we envision many TinyScreen users creating programs and sharing them with the entire community.\nThe examples and library code can also be used with other software tools, like the standard Arduino IDE, to give you flexibility with how you develop your projects.\nOne Click Download\nIf you don't know how to program - don't worry, using Codebender updating the program in your TinyScreen is simple.  Just plug it into the USB of your computer, push a button on the website, and in about 10 seconds the new program is uploaded to your TinyScreen system.  It's that easy!\nThe TinyDuino Platform\nThe TinyDuino is essentially an full blown Arduino shrunk down to the size of a quarter.  The TinyDuino processor board has the same processor as the Arduino Uno (an Atmel Atmega328P) and now includes an onboard Lithium battery charger and battery connector.  All of the shield signals are supported, so all of your existing Arduino sketches will work as is.\nMaking projects with your TinyScreen is easy through the use of stackable TinyShields.  Add sensors, communication, motor drivers or hook up your own external circuitry by stacking in the right TinyShield for your application. \nThere are currently over 25 TinyShields with more coming out every month.  There are sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, 9-Axis IMU, ambient light sensor), output boards (motor drivers, audio output, displays), storage (SRAM, EEPROM, microSD card), communication (USB, Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE, WiFi, 433MHz,802.15.4, Ethernet) and breakout boards to connect to external sensors and circuitry.\nTinyDuino Board Updates\nAlong with the TinyScreen, this campaign is also introducing the most major overhaul to the TinyDuino platform since it's launch in 2012.\nJoystick TinyShield\nA new TinyShield that adds two analog joysticks for things like playing games and controlling devices like RC helicopters, robots and cars.  Each joystick can also be pushed as a switch input, and the Joystick TinyShield uses the I2C bus to free up I/O pins for other usages.\nTinyDuino Processor Board (major update)\nA major design evolution by adding a Lithium battery charger on board, battery connector, and an On/Off slide switch.  The coin cell option is also available with this new board version.   \nUSB TinyShield (major update)\nThe USB TinyShield has been updated to use a new FTDI USB converter and adds an option to locate the USB connector on the side or top of the PCB to give you more options where to plug in the USB cable.\nBluetooth Low Energy TinyShield (major update)\nA new version of the BLE TinyShield that lowers the TinyShield size and price using the Nordic nrf8001 BLE radio.  App support will also be available for Android and iOS to allow cell phone notifications to be transmitted to this BLE TinyShield to allow for things like Smart Watch notifications.  \nTechnical Specs\nTinyScreen\n96x64 OLED display, 16-bit color depth\n0.96\" (24.4mm) viewable area\nTotal Size: 1.02\" x 0.98\" (25.8mm x 25.0mm)\nSoftware controllable backlight (OLED brightness)\nPower down mode\nFour push buttons along the sides (connected to IO pins)\nSPI interface for display\n3.0V to 5.5V operation (higher voltages supported with TinyShield power regulator)\n20 - 45mA max supply current (depending on brightness)\nOpen Source\nWe are major supporters of Open Source Hardware and Software.  All of the software and hardware files for the existing TinyDuino platform are available on our website for download and modification, and the TinyScreen is as well.\nWho are We?\nWe are TinyCircuits - a Maker of Tiny Open Source Electronics based in Akron, Ohio.  We got our start in 2012 with the launch of the TinyDuino Project on Kickstarter.  This project exceed it's goal by over 1000%, which let us set up a full design and manufacturing operation in a 100 year old former tire factory in downtown Akron.  We have grown to a team of seven and are selling the TinyDuino products all around the world. Thanks Kickstarter! \nWe manufacture all our own products in house with our own Surface Mount Assembly Line (including Stencil printers, Pick and Place and reflow oven).  Over the past two years, we've manufactured tens of thousands of units reliably, for our own customers and for others.  Most recently, we built 6000 units of the Digispark Pro for their recent Kickstarter campaign.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTwo years ago we launched the TinyDuino project on Kickstarter which greatly exceeded our expectations (and raised about 1100% of it's goal). This let us set up our own manufacturing operation in Akron, OH, where we are able to assembly, test and ship all of our products. We produced over 15,000 different board assemblies as part of this and shipped to over 1100 different backers. \n\nSince that initial Kickstarter, we've released about 20 new products (mostly add on for the TinyDuino platform), and have learned a tremendous amount about manufacturing quality and reliable products, and have fined tuned our production process.\n\nOne of the biggest risks / challenges we see from this project is the procurement of the OLED screens themselves, since these will be from an overseas source and in a high volume. We have consulted with two different distributors of the OLEDs screens, and have a second model identified from a different vendor that we could switch to if something comes up with the original screen vendor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Over!

Alongside these mythical creatures, half-dragon, half-chimera, players compete in epic duels to inscribe their name in the legend of Oniris, the dream world.\nDRAKERZ-Confrontation is the first-ever tactical card game in augmented reality for PC. Most other TCGs are played either with \u201cvirtual\u201d cards or with \u201creal\u201d (paper) cards. In DRAKERZ-Confrontation, you get to enjoy the best of both gaming experiences. By playing with your \u201creal\u201d premium cards, you will experience new sensations, half way between those of a board game and those of a tactical card game. Point scoring and card cost is entirely managed by the computer, allowing you to concentrate on what\u2019s essential: combat.\nFor the past 15 years, our independence allowed us to develop very innovative and interactive experiences, which are the fruit of a mix between technology and creativity.  \nWe have been working on DRAKERZ-Confrontation for three years now, and are proud to present an extraordinary game, straight out of our wildest dreams. DRAKERZ-Confrontation's Beta version is currently available on Steam and on our website. \nHowever, our independence is costly, and without your help, we won\u2019t be able  We won\u2019t be able able to complete the game. \nNow it's time to finish the game.... all we need is your support!\n\nGames like DRAKERZ-Confrontation are known as TCGs, or \u201cTrading Card Games\u201d.\nCollecting DRAKERZ-Confrontation cards is at the heart of our gaming experience. Each card has a special effect to be discovered. From creating armor to protect your Drako to casting a spell to snare your opponent, the tactics and choices are infinite. Will you be a daring attacker or a cunning defender? It\u2019s up to you to develop your own strategy by selecting the cards that will create your ideal game.\nDRAKERZ-Confrontation is played online: you must be connected to the Internet to play. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t play alone; in addition to the multiplayer mode, Drakerz Confrontation offers a variety of duels against the computer in the story mode.\n\n\nDRAKERZ-Confrontation is the first ever tactical card game in augmented reality for PC. Most other TCGs are played either with \u201cvirtual\u201d cards or with \u201creal\u201d (paper) cards. With Drakerz Confrontation, you get to enjoy the best of both gaming experiences. In playing with your \u201creal\u201d premium cards, you will experience new sensations, half way between those of a board game and those of a tactical card game. Point scoring and card cost is managed entirely by the computer, allowing you to concentrate on what\u2019s essential: combat.\n\nAs for your virtual cards (FREE mode), they are accessible on your account regardless of the computer you are using to connect. Last but not least, DRAKERZ-Confrontation can be played without a computer!\n\n\nOniris is a parallel universe where magic and fantasy come to life once, only known by those initiated to the \"waking dream\": the Drakoneers... Nowadays, only remembered in our legends.\n\nToday, electronic eyes of our modern cameras enable us to recover the gift of seeing Oniris and the creatures that populate it again... This is no coincidence: a new generation of Drakoneers is being recruited to battle against a great threat!\nIs it a war song or a moan being heard from the nightmare lands? What happened to the Legendary Drakoneers and their Drakos, protectors of Oniris? And what happened to the great Dragon, the first among the Drakos?\nDRAKERZ-Confrontation takes you into the heart of an epic quest, rich in adventures that are part of the extended universe of DRAKERZ.\n\nFight and advance in Drakerz\u2019s leagues and global rankings to become the best... Forge your legend! Will you have the power to keep at bay the dangers that threaten Oniris? Will you have the guts and dare to become a Legendary Drakerz?\n\n\n   \n  The first step in playing DRAKERZ-Confrontation is to choose your Drako among one of six species. As a Drakerz, you can \u201cride\u201d any of these extraordinary beings but choose carefully as each type has its own abilities.\nLike lightning, a Felis never strikes in the same place twice. Swift in tooth and claw, it sunders the sky, armors and your opponents. With verve, fury and tenacity, a Felis knows to be patient when it comes to schooling opponents. Weaken? Never. Fail? Impossible! Even when mortally wounded, it can come back from the brink of death and punish his opponent!\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Animal Kingdom\nQUALITIES : Patience, tenacity\nTALENTS : The gift of regeneration\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : Felis regenerate health points when their health drops below a certain threshold.\n\n\nStrong as a rock, that\u2019s the Gorok. But it is sensitive, too... To cracking and tearing and dismantling! The Gorok is a giant bruise-maker in a world of heavyweight louts. A heart of stone? Yes, but between a Gorok and his Drakoneer exists an unbreakable bond. Your Gorok will do anything for you: dismember a few opponents, use their bleached skulls for drums, or fill up the arena with his molten battle-roar. Because that\u2019s what Goroks do.\n\nPROFILE : Mineral kingdom guardian\nQUALITIES: Reckless, impulsive\nTALENTS : Deals out earth-shaking blows\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : Gorok hits harder whenever its fury is full\n\n    Due to their natural concealment abilities, Meleons are feared and fearsome fighters. One might think a Meleon would be content to disappear, only to strike where and when its opponent expects it the least. But that doesn\u2019t take into account the Meleon\u2019s \"playful\" nature. Meleons take great pleasure in gaining victory through surprise attacks, master strokes, or simply through apparently insane maneuvers.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Plant Kingdom \nQUALITIES : Cunning, unpredictable\nTALENTS : Knows how to blend into its surroundings\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : Meleons may draw extra cards at the start of their turn. \n\n    A Furkhan is well acquainted with that particular emotion called \u201cfear\u201d. It will hunt down your opponent to the point of giving him or her cold sweats. Its Furies, darker than your worst nightmares, will wear the confidence of its enemies out. It knows nothing of pity. It gives no quarter. It will stop at nothing to achieve victory. Though it is shrouded in shadow and darkness, don\u2019t start to think its soul is dark: a Furkhan is unfailingly loyal to the one its has chosen as its Drakoneer.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Animal Kingdom \nQUALITIES : Fast, precise\nTALENTS : Good at taking its opponents by surprise\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : The Furkhan pays one less mana point for a special movement\n   \nIt is said that Ogams are the oldest Drakos the world has ever known. Is it because they are steeped in magic and ancient secrets? Or because they\u2019ve been guided by many Master Drakoneers on the Way? It\u2019s hard to say, but one thing is certain: their knowledge of Mana is incomparable. For an Ogam, Mana is everything. An Ogam knows that Mana flows through dreams like blood through veins. His charm is poisonous and his dance is fatal.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Plant Kingdom\nQUALITIES : Wise, powerful\nTALENTS : It knows all the secrets of the Mana\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : The Ogam Drakerz gains more mana when it discards a card\n \n  A body studded with horns and gemstones; a thick, tough hide that deters even the bravest; innumerable feet bedecked with claws: such is a Kwartz. The large crystals, supple as scales, that cover his back form a gleaming bunker. A Drakonner leads its Kwarts into combat biting as the cold wind and as fast as an avalanche. A Kwartz is also capable of rising into the air to pierce his opponents with a laser-like Fury.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Mineral Kingdom\nQUALITIES : Unshakable, surprising\nTALENTS : His defenses are unshakable\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : The Kwartz adapts his defense to attacks it receives\n \n  These are the simplest type of card to play: pay the price of the invocation and apply the card\u2019s effects. Effects can be instantaneous (effects are applied immediately and do not last), or temporary (they are applied immediately and last as long as indicated on the card). Once played, the cards are discarded (put aside and not played again).\nThese cards are unique in that they are played only during the opponent\u2019s turn and only when he has just played a card. The consequences are two-fold: effects of the Interruption card are applied before those of the card played by the opponent, and his or her Card Placement Phase ends immediately. As such, these are powerful cards that you need to learn to play at the right time.\n\nThese cards can have effects on Armor, Weapons or Fury, or can be Tactical. Effects of an Equipment card last as long as it is in play. An Equipment card is not discarded after being resolved. They have a level of effect of 1, 2, or 3. When played, an Equipment card starts at Level 1. Its level can be raised with the help of Upgrade cards. Equipment cards have several casting costs. When they are played, the first level is used to determine the cost of the card, and likewise for the levels that follow.\n\nThe Fury is the Drako\u2019s most powerful attack, but also the most difficult to execute. It is necessary to play this type of card to set off a Fury. This card\u2019s effectiveness will also depend on the Fury Pool value that appears on the interface.\n\nThose one only target Equipment cards and are used to change their levels, either by upgrading your Equipment or by lowering the level of your opponent\u2019s Equipment. If the equipment is at level 1 and it has been reduced (dropped to level 0), the equipment will be destroyed and discarded from play.\n\n\n\n  We are an indie studio and our efforts have brought the development of DRAKERZ-Confrontation to 90% of it being a releasable game. However, we will need external help in order to bring the game to completion.\nTo help improve the game we are giving Early Access players the opportunity to have their say in how our game is shaped by joining as a user in our BETA game. Most of the major features for DRAKERZ-Confrontation are already implemented and we now need your help to finish the last features.\nOur first goal is $30,000. This amount will be enough to reach the last of our art and engineering requirements. We have a clear number of stretch goals. With your support we will be able to launch DRAKERZ-Confrontation with all the features we imagine.\n\ncontact us\nLike us on Facebook, We\u2019ll be posting FREQUENT UPDATES.

Is every starter the same except for the choice of creature? Does your opponent see your KS exclusive draco or do they see the normal one? Are all the exclusive looks the same for everybody? Does the player design the exclusive look? Is the exclusive look a skin change or color change or a complete model change? I think I remember reading about crafting cards.

It can talk to many devices, and you can talk to Homey. Say what you want, when you want it, and Homey takes care of it. Homey learns your ways and predicts which things to do, to make you happy.\nHomey is designed for everyone\nWhether you\u2019re a businessman, student, grandparent or housewife, Homey is there for you when you need it. We want to get technology out of the way so you can focus on what matters most to you, and Homey takes care of the rest.\nA few things Homey can do\u2026\nHomey combines your devices and the internet, allowing for smart scenarios:\nWhen you get home, your lights fade on, your thermostat is already set to a comfortable level and your favorite music is streamed to your receiver.\n  When you need to wake up, the curtains or blinds are opening, your morning tune is playing on your stereo while the weather for today and your e-mails are being read to you. The smell of fresh and automatically made coffee gets you out of bed.\n  When you\u2019re in the supermarket, you decide it\u2019s going to be pizza tonight. You tell the Homey app to pre-heat your oven by switching it on. If you have a smart fridge, your grocery shopping list is sent to you.\n  When you want to watch a movie, the blinds close, your lights dim, your music fades out, the TV is set to the correct channel and your media center plays the movie.\n  When you leave your house, Homey tells you it\u2019s going to rain soon, and reminds you to take an umbrella. When you're the last person to leave the house, Homey turns down the heat and switches all your lights and devices off to save energy. Finally, Homey makes sure that your front door is really locked.\n  When you get a call, your music pauses while the call is routed via Bluetooth from your phone and sent to the speakers closest to where you currently are.\nUPDATE: Stretch goals\nSince we have reached our goal this fast, there is room open for many more. We have a lot ideas for Homey, but limited time to develop. With more funding, we can invite more members to the team, which can develop more functionality!\nIt just works\nWhen you plug it in, Homey already works with most of your devices, and support for many more will come. Next to home appliances, it connects to your entertainment systems and online accounts. Homey is the living hub that intelligently connects everything in your life.\nHomey works with...\n...and many more!\nScience!\nWhile this sounds like magic, it\u2019s actually science: Homey includes 7 wireless modules that work on various frequencies and protocols, all integrated together in an intelligent and easy-to-use device with state-of-the-art speech recognition. And to make sure we don\u2019t miss out on your older devices and television sets, we\u2019ve added an Infrared Power-LED. Yes, you may throw away all your remotes now.\nThere\u2019s an app for that\nBecause there are a lot of devices used out there, and new ones being released every day, Homey features an app store, so you can continuously get freshly made apps by fellow enthusiasts and device brands. All apps are checked, so you don\u2019t have to worry about privacy and safety.\nDevelopers and hobbyists can also publish directly to the Labs section, where you can freely share your own homebrew projects.\nHomey can talk to all types of devices using various wireless technologies\nDo I have supported products?\nYes, you have! Homey already works with the most basic devices at home, such as your older, infrared-controlled TV set. Let Homey connect to your mail, calendar en weather service and your already have quite the smart assistant, which only gets smarter and smarter as you purchase more (wireless) devices!\nOut of the box\nWhen you use Homey for the first time, it already knows how to talk with most of your devices. In the event that you own a device that Homey isn't yet familiar with, like your older television, you can easily learn Homey how to talk to it using your remote. As a bonus, these device codes are then shared to other Homey owners, so that everyone that owns the same device can profit instantly.\nMultilanguage\nBecause not everyone is a native English speaker, Homey is multi-language. At first we support English, Dutch, German, Spanish and French, and more languages will be added later on, prioritized by our backer's locations.\nFor the geeks, developers, hobbyists\nWe are geeks and we'd love to have a part of our backers to be geeks too. Everyone can develop for Homey, because we designed it with openness in mind. We don\u2019t like all that commercial blahblah, we do this to give you the best experience!\nHomey works with apps written in JavaScript. An app can do various things, such as controlling one of Homey\u2019s hardware modules, use the Internet, make another app smarter or tell you a Chuck Norris joke when you ask for it.\nApps can talk to each other. For example, with a few lines of JavaScript, you can tell Homey to play your friend\u2019s favorite song when they enter your house with your homemade nfc door lock.\nBy pledging as geek, you don\u2019t only get Homey, but also example code for your own Homey app, an Arduino library and early access to the SDK. You'll also get two nRF24L01+ radio transceivers to communicate wirelessly plus enough jumper cables to get you started.\nTwo nrf24l01+ transceivers, included with the Geek Edition\nTechnical specifications\nHomey has in total 8 radio modules, which are accessible through our high-level JavaScript API:\nWi-Fi 802.11b/g/n\nBluetooth 4.0\nNFC\nZigBee\nZ-Wave\n433.92 MHz\nnrf24l01+\nInfrared\nThese are all connected to a Raspberry Pi Compute Module, which runs our custom software. Homey runs on a node.js server, so developers can make use of the easy-to-learn JavaScript language.\nHomey works with a 12V adapter, which will be shipped with a connector to match your region. For now we promise type A and C plugs only (US and EU mainland), when we have more backers from foreign countries, we\u2019ll do our best to include your local plug!\nThe sphere is 11 cm (4.3\") in diameter. In the middle you will find a multi-colored LED ring that empowers apps to give feedback to the user, and the small circle on top is for the Infrared Power-LED to shine through the casing.\nThe Homey Smartphone App is available for iPhone and Android users. Users of other operating systems can use their browser to access and configure Homey on the go.\nHistory, Current state and Timeline\nHomey has been in development for the past three years as both a hobby and university project. In the hobby phase, the speech recognition used was a hybrid between Microsoft's and Google's, combined with a display for visual feedback. Shortly after, the project was rewritten in Node.js for a University's project with use of Google's speech recognition, added with our own sauce of intelligence.\nA *very* early prototype :)\nWe are sure that an intelligent home will never work without support for all your devices. That was why we chose for an open platform, that allows everyone to contribute, based on Node.js running on the Raspberry Pi.\nRaspberry Pi with a 433.92MHz transmitter\nTo launch this project as a consumer product, the Raspberry Pi will be replaced by it's industrial variant, the compute module. Then, all wireless modules will be hooked up to it, and finally put it all in the orb casing.\nHardware demo video\nThe development in the coming time will be primarily focused on getting all the parts in the orb. We are also further developing the mobile applications and marketplace, and starting the mass production process for the casing. After that, bulk ordering of the modules and assemblage of the product are up to finalize Homey.\nJump in and contribute!\nWe want to bring Homey to the world, to make the lives of everyone easier and more fun. And you can help us make that goal a reality and be a part of the future of homes. Backers will receive:\n((Super) Early Bird) Homey\nPledging this option will get you the home of the future. Talk to it and control your home!\nYour Homey includes support for a broad range of devices to set you off in minutes.\nYou will also get early access to the Homey app store to download extensions and improve your life.\nHomey backers will be given the opportunity to suggest apps and devices that we just can\u2019t miss.\nWe will always listen to you. Your feedback is taken into consideration very carefully to make sure Homey stays at the very top.\nGeek Edition\nGet all the benefits listed above on the default Homey option.\nPlus, you will get immediate developer access to the Homey app store and SDK \u2013 both the regular and the Labs section.\nYou will be provided with 2 wireless radio transceivers also found in Homey to make your hobby projects Homey-compatible, plus  jumper cables to add them to your project.\nAlso, both sample app code as an Arduino library will be available to you to make sure you don\u2019t have any hassles!\nA High level Javascript API will be provided for easy access to all of Homey\u2019s hardware.\nHomey-homie\nIf you want to support us, but don't have the money for Homey itself, this is your pick!\nYou'll receive a unique, miniature Homey with a multi-colored LED ring. There'll also be a NFC tag inside, so you can use it to unlock your door, for example!\nOther ways to contribute\nSpread the word!\nMaybe you can\u2019t kick in on one of the options above. The great thing is, to help Homey succeed, there is more you can do: Like this Kickstarter page, post, tweet, blog and pin (about) us, email your friends, talk to your co-workers, convince your family and dog or do whatever you do best to share us with the world. Also, while you\u2019re at it, you can find us on Facebook over here. Go on, click that Like button!\nDonate brain cycles\nWe have tons of ideas of how we can use Homey, but you sure have many too! Getting input from everyone is very important for us to make Homey the very best, like no tech ever was. Have some thoughts on Homey? Ideas for supported devices? Awesome appness? Cool scenarios? Post them in the comments or send them to us by the medium you like: email, facebook, twitter, postcard or carrier pigeon.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n== Licensing of Technologies ==\n\nWe do our utmost best to make sure all the licensing is properly fixed before we ship the device. We will make sure that the product you get shipped is hardware-wise capable with all the technologies touted before, so a possible missing license could be added through a software update.\n\n== CE/FCC Certifications ==\n\nAlthough we are doing our very best and are in collaboration with local test labs and the University of Twente, CE and FCC certifications remain a tricky issue. First of all they are really not cheap, especially FCC requires extensive testing by accredited labs, and secondly they might delay the process if clearance is not given in the timeframe we estimated. Although we already took this into account, government-issued certifications always post risks.\n\n== Overwhelming demand ==\n\nTo handle overwhelming demand, our perks will be released in batches, each with its own estimated delivery time. This is to prevent early backers to receive their product much later than anticipated, and to give every backer a clear indication of the estimated delivery time for their product.\n\nThis is of course the only problem we're hoping to face ;-)\n\n== Supplier delays ==\n\nSince we are incorporating many different technologies in one device, we have to deal with a lot of suppliers for all the components. Although we have multiple options for each part, communication with suppliers or delays can cause for unexpected delays in the process, especially since many electronic parts are manufactured in Asia nowadays. We will keep you updated on our progress and take reliability and reviews into account when ordering to minimize this risk, but not all can be prevented.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Our last Kickstarter update!", "update_content": "Dearest Homeys,\nThe final Kickstarter orders, those from outside of Europe, will be shipped next week.

The base, is made from high-quality plywood birch. And the light is LED, with a lifespan of 50,000 hours, a warm glow, and won\u2019t get hot.\nSunlight only!

To control your uArm wirelessly as well as having the opportunity to be the first to play with our smart phone apps, you can back us with an additional $30 and send us an email to feedback@ufactory.cc \nSee more details about the Bluetooth here.\nThe Story\nWhen hearing the word \u201crobot\u201d, most of us may think of the giant industrial robot arms. They can precisely install the components at a very high speed, or handle many complex, even dangerous tasks. \nRobots are awesome, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice if everybody who wants a robot arm can actually afford one? After all, $50,000 is kind of a lot of money. This is when we, the UFactory come in. UFactory stands for \u201cYour Factory\u201d. We build various robotics products to make robots more accessible for everyone! That\u2019s why we started the uArm project - a desktop miniature robot arm.\nPhoto: ABB\nThe Robot \nWhat is uArm?\nuArm is a 4-axis parallel-mechanism robot arm, inspired by the ABB PalletPack industrial robot arm IRB460. \nIt is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts, powered by standard RC hobby servos, and controlled by an Arduino-compatible board. In parallel-mechanism robot arm, most of the masses concentrate on the base, making the robot much more stable and allows the upper Arm to react really fast.\nAbove are some of the prototypes we had so far.\nWhat can you do with uArm?\nWell, in two words: COOL Things!!!\nOnce you got your uArm, you can immediately customize it with your own components. For example:\nYou can add a LED to make a computer-controlled desk lamp!\nOr install it on the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.\nOr play music!\nOr help you to send business card!\nOr make a small assembly line at your desk!\nOr program it to do your homework!\nOK, probably not doing your homework. But the possibilities are infinite; there are many more fun applications that can be done by using your uArm kit. And as you try to make it work, you will learn a lot about robotics and coding.\nThe uArm can also be a great gift to get people interested in Robotics. Since it could be easily controlled with a smartphone, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t plan to do anything with it, a desktop robot arm will be a WONDERFUL decoration!\nHow do I use it?\nRight now we have already developed a Windows application that allows the uArm to be controlled with keyboard or mouse. \nA serial communication program that uses Processing to create a host computer program that displays simple OpenGL object to show the orientation of the controls and reads keyborad event then sends command to the uArm.\nUsing mouse to control uArm to play Cup Stacking via serial.\nWith some basic controlling skills, you can use basically any input device to control it, for example, we have also used other remote controller to control the arm. With our imbedded inverse-kinematics algorithm, the uArm can be precisely controlled using coordinates. \nWe are currently working with the Android and IOS apps as well, so you can control the uArm via Bluetooth as well. \nWe have also written an Arduino library specifically for controlling the uArm. So if you are familiar with Arduino, you can program it directly with Arduino IDE. By calling different functions, you can easily move uArm to your desired position without doing tons of hard math.\nUPDATE: We have just sketched out a new function for the uArm which allows you to simply dragging it around as the uArm records the critical coordinates for later playback! With this function, you can now TEACH the uArm to accomplish simple tasks without writing a single line of code, or even connecting to your computer\uff01\nFurther Details:\nThe basic design is Arduino-controlled with 4 degrees of freedom. Three servos on the base control the main movement of the arm and the mini servo on the top moves and rotates the object. The end-effector of the arm is always kept parallel to the ground.\nWe also made some other designs of the end-effector for applications and extensions.\nMechanical Parts:\nThe structure of the arm is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts.\nIn addition to some screws, nuts and brass stand-offs, we also provide some flanged bearings, one large bearing, and 4 suction cups for you to complete the assembly of the arm.\nBy adding the bearings the arm can work smoothly and stable.\nThese parts, along with the servos, allow you to build the arm and a gripper end-effector.\nElectronic Parts:\nThe micro-controller is an Arduino compatible board. And we also develop a shield for Arduino to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too.\nThe electronic parts of the Basic uArm consist of 3 standard servos, 1 micro servo, 1 Arduino-compatible board, 1 uArm shield, 1 USB cable and 1 wall adapter power supply.\nThe electronic parts for the gripper end-effector consist of 1 micro servo.\nThe electronic parts for the suction cup end-effector consist of 1 small vacuum pump and 1 solenoid valve.\nThe electronic parts for EARLY BIRD & Gripper Kit\uff1a\nThe electronic parts for Suction Cup Kit\uff1a\nThe electronic parts for Replaceable Kit, Custom Message Engraved Kit, Complete Assembled Kit & Advanced Kit:\nMounting:\nThe uArm comes standard with 4 suction cups for the base of the arm, to allow you to mount the arm on any smooth horizontal surface, such as a smooth desktop or floor.\nYou can also install the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.\nuArm Work Envelope (working range of the arm):\nWhat is the payload weight capacity for uArm?\nIn our informal testing, we have found that the uArm can easily lift and move a regular can of soda. \nMore testing will be carried out later and more accurate data will be specified.\nOpen source!!!\nuArm will be completely open-sourced after the Kickstarter campaign completes! We will use the time in between to optimize our design and make it the best it can be. We are a company, yes, but we are also a group of robot maniacs. We want to share our joy with the rest of the world and make more people realize how fun robotics can be! All of the design files, hardware and software will be released in May, 2014. So you can build your own arm using a laser cutter, then add you own controller and servos to it. \nEven if this project fails, we will still release all the files online. If this project succeeds, though, we will be able to launch more open source robotics kits and mechanical platforms! Cheers!\nHow to assemble uArm?\nWe will offer a full step-by-step tutorial describing how to assemble uArm after we finish the finial design. Now we have a simple Assembly Diagram for the current version.\nEvolution of uArm\nMechanical Parts:\nThe major revisions of the mechanical parts are on the thickness of the Acrylic parts and the base of the arm.\nWe changed the thickness from 3mm to 5mm.\nWe have made an electronic module holder for the electronic parts and also made a case for the vacuum pump and solenoid valve in the latest version.\nWe have made 3 versions of the base of the arm so far. In the first version, the mounting is not convenient. So in the second version, we added 4 suction cups on the base and you can also use screws and nuts for mounting. In the third version, we added a bearing on the base, so the arm can move smoothly and stable.\nElectronic Parts:\nWith electronic parts, we have made 5 versions so far. In the latest version, we make a shield of Arduino for the arm to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too. The micro-controller in the final version is still an Arduino compatible board.\nThe first version: A micro-controller board, a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The second version: A micro-controller board (Arduino Leonardo), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The third version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The fourth version: A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\nThe fifth version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), an uArm shield, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\nThe latest version we have made so far:\nWhy we need you  \nWe are robot maniacs with the goal of making robotics kits more accessible to the public and we want to help more people to see the beauty of robotics!\nuArm is our first developed platform. We now have several prototypes, but they can still be made better. Currently the uArm can\u2019t perform super accurate motion due to our tight budget; also if we can injection mold some of the parts, the assembly process can be greatly simplified; We are also planning to design and build the next version of the arm. It will be stepper-motor driven with metal frames thus it will be more accurate. And we will add remote control function on PC, Mac and Smart Phones as well. Furthermore, if we can get gather enough public attention, we can corporate with big companies to send these robot arms to schools, and give children access to robots!\nWe are eager to make the uArm better, cheaper and easily accessible. so more people can enjoy the fun of robotics. And all of these cannot be done without your support!\nRewards\nAs rewards, we will offer the parts or a complete kit to build your own uArm from acrylic or wood. Only Complete Assembled Kit and Advanced Kit are assembled. More details are listed below.\nTimeline\n28/02/2014  Finish type selection of the servos and optimization of the arm.\n01/03/2014  Start  development of an application on PC for Mac or Smart Phone APP if we hit the stretch goal. Start writing some sample test for the arm.\n10/03/2014  Finish the \"Getting Started with uArm\" document for users.\n15/03/2014  Purchase the materials for manufacture.\n25/03/2014  Start manufacturing.\n20/04/2014  Package the reward kits.\n01/05/2014  Start shipping the reward kits.\nCommunication\nIf you still have other questions, you can post a comment or send an email to us at: ufactory.info@gmail.com \nWe will answer you as soon as possible.\nWe also have a forum on our website for discussion: forum.ufactory.cc\nThe Team\nUFactory is a team of makers from Shenzhen, China.

You can ask me to change speeds, direction or even dance around.\nWe created Ozobot to bring social gaming back to game night. Ozobot is a physical game piece that can play with virtual worlds, creating a bridge between old and new, cutting edge and nostalgic.\nWhile Ozobot loves to play, learning is also a natural activity. Imagine a group of school kids completing an app learning game using Ozobot\u2019s SmartCodes. In the process of completing their game mission, they are also learning the fundamentals of robotic programming...\nMeasuring slightly over an inch in diameter and height, Ozobot is the world's most compact smart robot of its kind and features some of the smallest components on the planet.\nOzobot will come with four free apps for iOS and Android. More apps will follow every few months along with 3rd party developers adding their creations into the mix.\nHelp Ozobot escape mazes using various SmartTiles as you navigate using straight lines, turns and intersections in order to win.\nPush the limits as you explore Ozobot\u2019s color language while creating intricate patterns and designs.\nA modern day game of chance. Watch Ozobot cruise through mazes and customizable exits to decide your fate.\nThis multi robot hybrid race game merges the digital world with physical tracks, creating a new and engaging gaming experience.\nThe possibility of bridging digital and physical gaming has been one of our most exciting frontiers. Ozobot's ability to operate in both worlds and autonomously navigate between them created a new realm which we call hybrid gaming. Whether you are enjoying the thrill of a racing game or testing your skills on a strategic board game, the Ozobot hybrid gaming platform will capture your imagination and let you experience new and classic games like never before.\nOur journey began in the spring of 2012 with the idea of finding different ways to play, learn and socially interact in an evolving digital world.\nThe idea gained traction when we started researching robots and their evolution through time. We started with a line-sensing robot and began building from there. Two years and countless revisions later, our idea grew into the smallest little robot we could make: Ozobot.\nSize and consistency of behavior has since been our driving forces to make Ozobot as small and as smart as possible. \u2026And with your help, it\u2019s going to be fun to see how far we can take Ozobot.\n\u201cLast year, Anki showed us the beauty (and business savvy) of combining physical and digital gaming. This year, its Ozobot\u2019s turn.\u201d\nRobotics Business Review (Emily Kent)\n\u201cWho says game night has to be confined to either a physical or digital world\u2026 Ozobot fuses elements from the physical (the robot) and digital (smartphone and tablet) world into one gaming experience and platform.\u201d\nPopular Mechanics (Davey Alba, Associate Editor)\n\u201cOzobot, a game-playing robot, wants you to get physical with digital games \u2014 and it could be on to something.\u201d\nMashable (Lance Ulanoff, Editor-in-Chief)\n\u201cWhat's interesting about Ozobot is the path detection and small size; it opens up possibilities that didn't exist with earlier, larger gadgets.\u201d\nPC Magazine (Jamie Lendino, Lead Analyst)\n\u201c[M]ost charming is Ozobot, a tiny robot that follows lines drawn on screens or paper\u2014it\u2019s a simple concept that\u2019s surprisingly fun\u2026It's easy to imagine a class of third-graders making their own tracks, learning the Ozobot logic, and generally being creative with the things.\u201d\nNBC News (Devin Coldewey)\n\u201cOzobot robots are looking to cross the bridge between digital and physical gaming worlds, all while adding a charming bit of randomness to the occasion\u2026Things get even more intriguing when you start to consider how the Ozobot can roam off a tablet screen and head onto a table top. All it takes is a line and some imagination.\u201d\nCNET (Amanda Kooser)\nWe have been working with our manufacturing partner for the last year to validate our prototypes and confirm Ozobot\u2019s readiness for production. We successfully completed our first sample run which we shared for the first time at CES. The results were overwhelmingly positive and we are happy and energized by the positive response. Thank you.\nWhile Ozobot is getting smarter, so are the games, and the Ozobot app team has been working tirelessly to keep up with Ozobot and develop the best ways to play. Today, Ozobot has four apps, and with your help we can keep building and sharing Ozobot with other developers to build more and more games and unearth capabilities that are yet to be imagined and designed.\nOzobot\u2019s first showing was a CES success. So now we believe, it is time to share Ozobot with the world!\nTo properly take Ozobot to market, we still need to go through a few phases including a comprehensive quality control process to make sure Ozobot passes all testing and can truly be market ready.\nWith your help we will:\nPhase 1 (from now through March)\nComplete final firmware and hardware adjustments\nFinalize production quality assurance procedures\nPlace first full scale production order\nObtain regulatory approvals and certifications\nPhase 2 (April - May)\nComplete the production run\nFinalize our initial iOS apps and Android porting\nShip product from factory\nPhase 3 (June)\nAll rewards shipped to backers\nRelease apps on the app stores\nPhase 4 (Q4)\nRelease our SDK for third party app developers\n  Show the world digital can be taken to a new level. Join our gaming revolution and spread the word through your network. Enlist others.

It works with all smartphones or tablets, doesn't matter the brand..\n It has 4 faces that allow you to project a holographic picture in 360\u00b0. The smartphone can be placed below .. or above the Pyramid..\nThis is how it works: the image to be projected is divided in 4 distinct images, and is reflected on the 4 faces of the pyramid creating an hologram in the center.\nHOLHO COLLECTION will be produced just in BLACK.  Only HOLHO FULL PYRAMID (tablet and smartphone) comes in different colours: GREEN, RED, BLUE, FUCHSIA, BLACK , WHITE. You can make your choice before the end of the project.\nWe designed two HOLHO Full Pyramids you can use with your 7\" or 10\" tablet. The image is divided in 4 parts and when projected on the 4 oblique faces, it produces the hologram in the center.\n The TABLET can be positioned above or below the Pyramid:\nHOLHO Naked is the simplest product of the HOLHO collection. It consists of an oblique sidewall that you can adapt  to your 10\" tablet, allowing you to have a frontal holographic projection.\nYour device needs to be inserted at the base of the structure. HOLHO Naked can be used with all 10\" tablets. Also, if you close it, it becomes a very stylish tablet case.\nHOLHO Zed is a very nice black Perspex device, with a spot on the top to place your tablet. It generates a holographic frontal projection. You can choose between the 7\" and the 10\" version.\nHOLHO ZED for 7\" and 10\u201d TABLETS.\n(without led and picture stand)\n\nHOLHO ZED for 10\u201d TABLETS with a PICTURE STAND and WHITE LED.\nThis version of the HOLHO ZED 10\u201d TABLET has a transparent photo stand - where you can insert a real picture - with a white LED to light the image.\nUsing  the videos we prepared for you, this HOLHO ZED structure becomes a unique photo frame, where the animation enhances your photo. It works with all 10\" tablets.\nHOLHO 3 Faces Pyramid is a very nice shiny black structure with a top drawer for the 10\" tablet  and an easy plug jack. The image is divided in three. When projected into  the  3 Faces Pyramid, the hologram appears in the center.\nIt is perfect for commercial use too: HOLHO 3 Faces Pyramid can be an amazing exhibitor or a perfect product demonstrator.\nThe HOLHO APP 3 FACES allows you to make a video able to produce a holographic projection. The APP divides the video in 3 parts, adapting them to the 3 Faces Pyramid. We recommend you to produce your video with dark background to better enhance the result of the hologram. \nHOLHO APP FULL PYRAMID\nThe HOLHO APP FULL PYRAMID allows you to produce a video for a holographic projection. The app divides the video in 4 parts for projection on the FULL PYRAMID. We recommend you to produce your video with dark background to better enhance the result of the hologram and with all figure subjects.\nEvery week the HOLHO team is making new videos for you to use with the HOLHO COLLECTION. At the end of the project, you will be able to choose your favorites.\nREWARDS LISTS:\nVIDEO PERSONALIZATION - 3D rotating cube:650 $\nIf you send us videos and pictures about you we will made a personalized video for you.\nVIDEO PERSONALIZATION:  1.700 $\nincluding one HOLHO FULL PYRAMID  (smartphone or tablet) and the HOLHO APP.\nWe can make a 30\" video editing your Company logo, supers and pictures using the motion graphic animation. Accordingly to your brief and our proposal we will produce a video tailored for you and we will adapt it to the device you choose. (OUR PARTNER: http://www.moviefarm.it)\nVIDEO PERSONALIZATION : 5.000 $\nincluding one HOLHO FULL PYRAMID  (smartphone or tablet) and the HOLHO APP.\nYou are already a HOLHO owner and you are pre-ordering a 30\" video made editing your Company logo, supers and pictures using the motion graphic animation and the 3D (your product basic animation). Accordingly to your brief and our proposal we will produce a video tailored for you and we will adapt it to the device you choose.  (OUR PARTNER: http://www.moviefarm.it)\nWhy are we asking for 58,000 dollars?\nTo make Holho, we have to produce at least 3 different specific steel molds that are very expensive. Also, the Perspex that we use for our Pyramid is a very expensive raw material that we have to order in advance to be able to produce the product. Perspex needs to be ordered in different colors in pre-set quantities. Last but not least, we need to prepare a variety of cool videos to play on your devices. Therefore we have to invest in creating the videos , editing them in 3D and Motion Graphic. Any funds that remain will be invested in further product research and development.\nOUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE:\nWhen the campaign will be successfully over we will immediately proceed to produce the molds.\nMolds production takes 4 weeks.\nAt the same time the raw material will be ordered and the application of the filter on the plexiglass faces will start.\nWhen molds are ready  the production is ready to begin and it takes 3 to 5 days to develop the product.\nTherefore, the delivery we have estimated on the site is accurate and guaranteed by the end of November 2013, and December 20th.\nFor higher volume of requests we will adjust the production to satisfy all the bakers giving notice and  keeping them informed.\n\nSHIPPING: please take a look on the rewards.\nWHO WE ARE...\nEnrica moved to the US six years ago.

Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp.\nWe at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.\nThe functional prototype\nThe Memoto camera comes in three different colors: Arctic White, Graphite Grey and Memoto Orange\nThe Functional Prototype\nHardware devices consists of mechanics, electronics and firmware. The mechanics are often overlooked, the 3D printed prototypes in our Kickstarter video has taken two engineers and one industrial designer over four months to finalize. The result is a production-ready construction of a weather protected, very strong and well designed camera casing.\nThe electronics has taken even longer to develop. We have used evaluation kits and break-out boards to put together a complete set of components in order to be able to start development of the firmware. At the same time we have made a circuit board design that fits all the components into a very tiny package.\nWhat does the functional prototype do?\nThe prototype does everything the final camera will do, taking photos and registering GPS position. \nSample photo and gps data from the Memoto prototype camera\nMiniaturizing the electronics\nNot only has miniaturized circuit board been designed by one of Sweden's foremost digital camera engineers who are working on our team, but it is also undergoing careful review and approval from these outside sources:\nThe head of engineering at our Taiwanese manufacturer, Yomura, to make sure it fits into the camera casing without causing any problems during assembly or long term use\nThe engineer that created the Anoto pen, in order to verify our power management and battery life\nThe engineer behind the electronics in the Mutewatch watch, to verify overall build quality and circuit wiring\nThe GPS chip manufacturer, to verify that the GPS will function properly and to compare it with their reference design\nThe GPS antenna manufacturer, to verify our antenna placement in relation to other components and the casing\nThe PCB currently waiting for review and quote from manufacturers.\nThe 8-layer High-Density-Interconnect printed circuit board with laserdrilled blind and buried vias\nWant more details? Here's a word from our engineers: \n\"The Memoto camera is small and uses fine-pitch BGA components with as small as 0.5 mm (0.02\") distance between the pads. This required the use of an 8-layer IPC-2226 Type-II HDI (High Density Interconnect) PCB of 4/4 mil track/space, with filled and capped laser-drilled partial vias of 0.1 mm (0.004\") diameter between the outermost layers as well as buried vias, which are mechanically drilled partial vias between layers inside the PCB. This via technology, including placing vias inside the BGA pads, is required to avoid interfering with routing on the top and bottom component layers and make room for fine-pitch BGA escape. Due to the presence of high-speed USB tracks and antenna signals on the PCB, it also has been impedance controlled which involves analysis of how the electric fields behave in the metal layers relative the other dielectric layers in the PCB.\"\nThe world's smallest wearable camera\nThe Memoto camera is a tiny camera and GPS that you clip on and wear. It\u2019s an entirely new kind of digital camera with no controls. Instead, it automatically takes photos as you go. The Memoto app then seamlessly and effortlessly organizes them for you.\nEasy and effortless\nThe camera has no buttons. (That's right, no buttons.) As long as you wear the camera, it is constantly taking pictures. It takes two, geotagged photos a minute with recorded orientation so that the app can show them upright no matter how you are wearing the camera. And it\u2019s weather protected, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it in inclement weather.\nThe camera and the app work together to give you pictures of every single moment of your life, complete with information on when you took it and where you were. This means that you can revisit any moment of your past.\nThe Memoto lifelogging camera - only 36x36x9 mm\nLong battery life\nThe camera\u2019s batteries won't need to be recharged until after approximately 2 days of use (using default photo frequency of 2 shots per minute). To recharge the camera\u2019s batteries, you connect the camera to your computer; at the same time the photos are automatically uploaded to Memoto\u2019s servers. There are no buttons to press. You just wear the camera, then charge it and wear it again.\nAccess your life through the Memoto app\nWith this many pictures captured and stored every day, we think it's crucial that you can easily browse among the best and most meaningful ones. The app we're building for iPhone and Android organizes the photos to work as a photographic memory even after many years.\nConcept images of the iPhone app. (Photos taken with a iPhone4S). From left: Timeline view with notifications, Map display, Social timeline view\nConcept images of the Android app. Left: Login screen. Right: Moment view in private mode.\nRelive your life like you remember it\nThe way this works is that the photos are organized into groups of \"moments\" on a timeline. On the timeline, you're presented with keyframes (about 30 per day) each representing one moment. You can tap a moment to relive it in a stop-motion like video of all the pictures in that moment.\nThe image analysis and organization is made out of the images\u2019 metadata, such as time, place and light. This enables you to not only browse your life the way you remember it, but to search for specific events of your life: who was it that you met at that party or what did the sunset looked like in Lapland in June? (Fun fact: there is no sunset in Lapland in June).\nThe app organizes all your photos on a timeline, making them easy accessable to search and share.\nYour photos are yours and only you can share them\nThe app comes with features for sharing through the biggest social media services. However, we want to stress that your Memoto pictures will always be private by default. That is, you only share pictures when you deliberately want to share them.\nCutting your storage costs at least in half\nThe Memoto Camera potentially produces a huge amount of bits and bytes. 4 GB data per day amounts to up to 1,5 terabyte per year. Instead of you storing all this on unreliable and expensive hard drives that can get stolen or lost, Memoto offers safe and secure infinite photo storage at a flat monthly fee, which will always be a lot more affordable than hard drives. For Kickstarter backers, the first year of storage is included in the reward!\nTechnical specifications\nCamera\nAutomatic photo capture at customizable frequency (default frequency is once every 30 seconds)\nDouble-tap on the camera case to manually take a photo and bookmark it\n5 megapixel resolution images\nLog of GPS positions and timestamps\nBuilt-in rechargeable battery which lasts up to two days\nLED battery life indicator\n2 full days of constant photographing (4000 pictures) space on memory\nBuilt-in accelerometer ensures that pictures are correctly oriented regardless of how the camera is worn\nMicro-USB port for charging and connecting to computer\nStainless steel clip to connect the camera to your clothes\n36x36x9 millimeters small\nSoftware\nAutomatic uploading of the photos to Memoto's servers by connecting the camera with your computer (Local storage is an option, but doesn't enable use of the Memoto app.)\nEncrypted storage for an indefinite number of photos (1 year subscription)\nEasy access of your photos through smartphone apps and browser\nApps for Android and iPhone\nPrivate and social layer - all pictures are in private mode only, until you choose to share them with your friends\nAll photos are stored and organized for you. None are deleted, but the best one are more visible.\nBrowse through your memories moment by moment. Tap to relive a moment.\nSearch for events in your history. Share with the ones you trust.\nWhy we're doing this\nOur search for the ultimate lifelogging device started with gathering people from all walks of life and asking them about their use of pictures and photographing. We let them try our very early prototypes of the camera and listened to their spontaneous thoughts about it. Then, we grouped their answers according to their expectations and needs:\nMemory - more pictures in order to remember more\n\"I wish I had more pictures to look back on and remember where I've been and with whom.\" - Falko, 34\nRe-experience - reliving moments from one own's and other people's lives\n\"If I had the opportunity to relive a moment I would like to see when my parents were young and a situation not playing out the way they've told me...\" - Marcus, 27\n\"I think the camera would capture from a different perspective and that it wouldn't be a re-experience but a completely new experience.\" - Elias, 26\nSurprise - having pictures that wouldn't have been taken\n\"When coming home from a trip I often find myself with pictures I could just as well have googled me to. But I feel I miss the nice small moments in ordinary life. I'd rather have one picture from that nice alley we passed in Paris, than five pictures of the Eiffel Tower.\" - Ulrika, 25\nPost-it wall from the prototype process\nPresence - avoiding disturbance a magic moment\n\"I rarely take photographs in social situations because it would disrupt the interaction I'm having.\" - Amelie, 25\nLife improvement - using data to observe and change behaviour\n\"Maybe it would be a wake-up call, making me change my routines and develop more as a person\" - Jenny, 38\nPreservation - documenting our children's life\n\"I want the pictures to be saved so me and the kids can look at them later. I think it's important the kids remember everyday things. Stuff that may be lost. I don't want us to just save pictures from ceremonial events.\" - Johan, 47\nControl - knowing the pictures are stored safely\n\"I can see myself using this, as long as I have perfect control\" - Jenny, 38\nConvenience - letting an automatic service managing the pictures\n\"I like the idea to not having to do anything myself and not be sitting with 5000 pictures to manage later\" - Ulrika, 25\nAn early prototype on one of the test persons\nWho we are\nExperienced entrepreneurs\nMemoto was founded by six Swedish serial entrepreneurs in 2012. Martin K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, formerly founder and CEO of blog search engine Twingly, shaped the concept of the Memoto camera, a wearable camera able to create a continuous life log for the user. For this task he recruited his friend Oskar Kalmaru, founder of an online video provider, as well as Bj\u00f6rn Wes\u00e9n, who was, at the time, a freelancing designer of high-tech electronics.\nTop quality team\n\nTogether, the three recruited some of the best and most talented persons available to complete the founder team. From Sweden's largest online photo diary Dayviews.com came UX and growth expert Sebastian Bj\u00f6rkelid. iOS developer Erik Hampusg\u00e5rd moved over from tech consultancy firm Sogeti and backend developer Simon Pantzare was attracted from lifelogging startup Linkura. During summer of 2012 the team grew quickly and the work with finalizing a beta version of the camera and the service intensified. In October 2012, the team was already up at 14 people.\nParts of the Memoto team\nWhat you get when backing us\nThe reward for us if you would back the Memoto camera would be tremendous. We would be able to see the product we've been working hard on, for almost a year now, finally go into production and hopefully worn on our first user.\nSo giving something back to everyone who help us fulfilling this dream is the least we can do. Thankfully, Kickstarter is a great place for this.\nTo reward every contribution, no matter of size, our first rewards start as low as $1. In those low ends, we include you in our ever-growing lifelogging family and let you be the first to know whenever something new comes out. You can also sponsor the environmental recycling of up to five cameras. And you get to see the lifelogging documentary we're working on before anyone else.\nThe best reward, we think, is of course to get your hands of one of the very first actual Memoto cameras. For the earliest of backers, we different levels of early bird specials where you get the camera before it reaches ordinary market, plus a well-deserved mention in the list of Memoto's Friends at Memoto.com.\nOne of the co-founders, Oskar Kalmaru, wearing the Memoto Orange prototype\nRead all about the rewards on the right of the page. Go ahead - make this happen now!\nProduction Schedule\nThings tend to take more time than you hope, doesn't it? Well, to be honest, we are actually a few months ahead of our initial production schedule at the moment but we do expect things to become trickier along the way. Therefore, we have a pretty conservative schedule laid out for us. Roughly, it looks like this:\nOctober 2012 \u2013 Finalizing design and construction of the Memoto camera\nNovember 2012 \u2013 Start tooling for plastic injection molding, do batches of electronics. \nDecember 2012 \u2013 Product tests, certification and finding fulfillment partner \nJanuary 2013 \u2013 Start production of final version\nFebruary 2013 \u2013 Start shipping the first Memoto cameras to our earliest backers.\nInternational taxes and shipping\nAs long as our products pass the standard quality test for a country or region, we are shipping to the entire world. Shipping is free. And the box we ship is a gift itself, from us to you, with a little surprise in it.\nLegality and safety\nMemoto\u2019s products and services is all about integrity. Everything you create with Memoto is yours - only yours. If you want to share your content with someone else we think you should. But only you decide when to do that. And even when you have shared your content you are still the owner of it.\n\nAll pictures you transfer to Memoto\u2019s cloud service are stored encrypted. The pictures are only visible to you: only you can see them and only you can change them. If you want to share a picture or a moment with someone you trust you have to make an active choice. The software contains no automatic share features, no hidden buttons, no \u201cshare-by-default\u201d. You only share your content when you want to.\nLegally, you may photograph what you want, as long as you don\u2019t obviously infringe someone else\u2019s integrity or violate an official photo ban. If someone asks you not to use your Memoto camera - then please don\u2019t. If someone doesn\u2019t explicitly ask you, but you have reason to believe that the place or the context is inappropriate for photographing - then please don\u2019t.\n\nMemoto\u2019s products and services are made for those of us who like to collect memories and stories about ourselves.\nAnd, last but not least, a big thank you to:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES AS SEEN WHEN LAUNCHING THE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ON OCT. 23 2012. (FOLLOW US ON BLOG.MEMOTO.COM FOR CONTINUOUS UPDATES ON HOW THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN MET.)\n\nBuilding a new kind of super small digital camera is a complex and time-consuming task. We are humble to the challenge and know there are many pieces that will need to be put together for it to work. One such thing is obviously financial and only with the help from Kickstarter will be able to get to production of the first Memoto Camera.\n\nGetting to the point where we can ship the camera to your door from the point we are at now, involves the following:\n\n1) Getting the design and construction ready for production. All the components must fit together, literally water tight. There is so much to take into regard when finishing this up. Fortunately, we have the construction experience of one of Taiwan's formost plastics manufacturers to rely on, as well as the design experience from our ex-Nokia industrial designer Per Brickstad.\n\n2) Fitting the electronics into such a tiny shell. This is no small feat. We have a functioning prototype with all the components in place. Right now we are finishing the wiring to send the first batch of PCBs to manufacturing. We have two very experienced camera engineers on our team to make this happen.\n\n3) Setting up a logistics and quality assured manufacturing chain. In every step of the production, our manufacturers need to have strict guidelines and tests to sort out the good units from the bad as early as possible. To assist us with this, we are leveraging the knowledge of people that have done this over and over for many projects before.\n\n4) Getting all the pieces of the firmware in place and working without problems. There is a big difference between having a functioning prototype taking photos and gathering GPS data (which we do) and having it function properly under adverse conditions out in the field. Again, our team members have built both hardware and firmware for cameras before, during several years of time.\n\nWe are not shying away from any of these challenges. While we are taking them seriously we are adamant in overcoming any problem. We are committed to getting the Memoto camera into the market and have all the skills needed to do so. With the help from the Kickstarter community we can have the resources to move into production while also completing all of the tasks above!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "It's here!

Check out SmartThings here. ***\nNew Video: Ubi & SmartThings\nUbi - Always on. Always ready to help.\nUbi is a voice-activated computer that plugs into a wall outlet. You talk to the Ubi and it talks back. It directly connects to the Internet through wifi.\n\"Look ma, no hands!\"\nWe believe people want to do things when they're at home - they clean, they fold laundry, they cook, they eat, they spend time with loved ones. These are all things that (for the most part) take up use of our arms and hands. When we're at home, we'd rather use our limbs for other activities than typing, scrolling, or swiping.\nUbi is short for ubiquitous computer because it's always on, always listening, always ready to help. It can scribe, listen, analyze. Ubi will either talk back to you the information you seek or indicate information through multi-color lights. \nUbi listens to its environment and senses it through sound, temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. It can record this information or use it to trigger events and communication.  \nWhat can it do? \nUbi can be used for potentially hundreds of applications. The applications we plan to ship with the Ubi are:\nVoice-enabled Internet search \nSpeakerphone \nIndicator light (light changing based on events, e.g. weather, stock, email) \nHome speaker system with sound piping \nVirtual assistant (audio calendar, feed reader, podcast etc) \nVoice memos \nAlarm clock \nIntercom system \nBaby monitor \nNoise pollution monitor \nControlling the climate of your home perfectly (through web enabled thermostats like Nest)\nA Helping Hand\nWe see a huge potential for Ubi to assist those who have visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. With its indicator lights and talk-to-activate functionality, Ubi is super simple to setup and use. We want the Ubi to make it easier for our parents and loved ones to stay connected with us and the world. \nYour Kickstarter Contribution \nWe're serious about making this technology of our dreams easily available to everyone. Your Kickstarter contribution is going to allow us to get safety approval (FCC and CE) so that it can be used everywhere. It will also help driving down the cost of making the Ubi so that everyone can afford at least one.  In a nutshell, your contribution will:\nAllow us to meet regulatory approval\nGet our first production run in place (tooling, machining, and chip printing - we are working with local firms who are very talented)\nAllow us to complete the initial apps we're going to deliver with the Ubi\nRewards\nEach Ubi reward above the $1 level comes with one Ubi unit that has wifi and a slew of other functionality. It also includes the Ubi web, iPhone and Android app and access to the Ubi portal to monitor and setup the Ubi remotely. You'll also get early access to the API.  \nUbi is available in arctic white or midnight black. Please specify which is your preference when you back the project.\n$1 - Access to backer-only updates and early offers when product is launched    \n$149 - Early backers - 1 Ubi (limited to first 100)\n$189 - Single Ubi \n$349 - Two Ubis \n$479 - Three-pack of Ubis \n$649 - Five-pack of Ubis\nNEW! - $1249 - The Inner Sanctum - The Ubi 10-pack and much more\nHow it works \nUbi plugs into a wall outlet and accesses the Internet through a wifi connection. It has a microphone and speakers and listens for commands. Saying \"Ubi\" wakes up the Ubi for receiving verbal commands. You can then instruct the Ubi to do your bidding. Ubi will receive plain language commands. Ubi communicates back to you through speech or by using lights.\nOnboard the Ubi are sensors to monitor your environment: \n\nTemperature\nHumidity\nAir pressure\nAmbient light\nThis data can be stored online or used to trigger alerts to your mobile device or email. \nThe Ubi runs Android with a powerful processor to perform voice recognition and also has the ability to connect to other devices. You can plug in speakers, USB drives, or connect through Bluetooth directly to your iPhone or Android device. For developers, you can also communicate with potentially thousands of devices (through RF, wifi, or Bluetooth) and we're making the device open so peripherals and other applications can be used with it. \nTechnical Specs on the Ubi \nAndroid 4.1 Jelly Bean \n800 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 Processor\n1 GB RAM \n802.11 b/n/g Wifi Enabled (WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption)\nHi fidelity speakers and omni-directional microphone \nUSB 2.0 with 5 V power supply \nBluetooth 4.0 \nTemperature, humidity, and air pressure sensors \nAmbient light sensor \nRF Transceiver Module \nPlugs into a standard NA 110 V, 15A power outlet (world versions to be forth-coming)  UPDATE: NA two-prong plug, but 100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz support! UPDATE #2: worldwide plug support available!\nDimensions (approximate): 4.0\" x 4.0\" x 1.1\"\nWhere We're At \nWe've been working for over ten months on the concept, design, and prototyping of the Ubi and we're now at a point where we're ready to bring it to the Kickstarter community. We've also built an early working prototype and have been refining the design to make it more compact and easier to use. We've been in contact with manufacturers and suppliers and have spec'ed out the costs for bringing the Ubi to market. Ubi is currently slated to work in English with North American voltages. We hope to expand this to other regions and languages. \nWe're working with local and overseas suppliers for sourcing the Ubi's electronics and plan on completing the machining, assembly, testing and certification of the Ubi in the Toronto area. We've also worked with certification authorities for pricing of safety and communication testing of the Ubi and inspection will be completed at the final point of assembly.\nOur team is experienced in working on dozens of projects for engineering research institutions. All of our team members have engineering backgrounds and have delivered on real engineering projects in the past.\nSample Data from the Ubi \nBelow is an example of some of the data that will be available from the Ubi as it monitors different aspects of its surrounding environment. The Ubi can constantly monitor your home to provide triggers or feedback. \n    Special Thanks and More\nThanks to all of our backers for helping us get this exciting project off the ground! We'd also like to thank the other Kickstarter projects that have inspired us like Twine, t\u014dd and Pebble.   \nA HUGE thanks goes to our extremely talented friend, Joe Sarafian, of RapidParts.ca for his help in creating our Ubi prototype. \nA special thanks also goes out to El Cantador for allowing us to use their music in our Kickstarter video.

In the last year, I've enjoyed my GoPro camera, but the mounting positions could be better. I was frustrated with shaky or hard to watch video caused from rapid head movements. The view from my chest or atop my helmet lacked perspective. I figured with a third person view it would capture more action taking place around me. I'd looked high and low for a better solution, but couldn't find anything at stores or on the web, so I made a commitment to create one myself.\nSome of you may be thinking \"I could make one of these\". The retail parts in this VuBackPole will run you about $190 + $30 in shipping, not including your time and effort. All you need do to verify is search the web for prices on carbon fiber tubing, aluminum snow shovels and RAM Mounts. Let me bring the cost down for you by manufacturing in bulk.\nPrototype\nAll action videos in my project were made with my prototype. After 12 months and 6 prototypes later, I'm ready to manufacture a design that meets my requirements for ease of use, quality of video and safety. It's lightweight aluminum, durable and works with GoPro, Contour and nearly any other action camera. If you are a professional or just shoot action footage for fun, I have the solution to superior quality viewing and enjoyment for you and your viewers.\nYou could buy parts of this product: high quality collapsible snow shovel $65, GoPole $60, GoPro Grab Bag Mounts $37, for a total of $162. And still, no third person perspective.\nThere's a reason third person shooter video games are so popular.\nThird Person Perspective\nIf you enjoy playing with this perspective, why not make your GoPro videos the same. Let your viewers feel like they're standing right behind you and part of the action. It's funny to watch, they'll start moving around like they're watching 3D.\nManufacturing\nThis product will be assembled in the USA. Some parts, like the RAM mount are made in the USA, Seattle WA, and others will be manufactured overseas. I'm still working with US manufactures to get the shovel spade and carbon fiber tube built here. If I can negotiate the costs down to be competitive with overseas quotes, I will. My desire is to make this as much a US based product as possible.\nLet's do this together and make this a successful project that our friends and family can all enjoy for years to come in our views.\nThanks in advance for making this project a reality.\n//Rodger Dean\\\\\nYouTube Channel\nhttp://VuVantage.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rodger Dean\n3 created \u00b7 26 backed\nI enjoy being in the Alaska backcountry riding snowmobiles, ATV's, fishing, and enjoy anything outdoors.

Ringbow transforms touch screen gaming, allows remote control of your operating system, applications, music apps and presentation tools, allows you to operate and answer your phone remotely and turns your device into a multi-user or multi-player platform. \nSince touch screens are controlled with fingers, a finger-worn tool, specifically a ring, is the natural choice for complementing them. Operating Ringbow with your thumb, in conjunction with using a touch device, enables countless new features and a much more efficient user experience. Ringbow multiplies the functionality of your finger together with allowing amazing simultaneous actions providing powerful capabilities and layers of functionality that are simply not available in today\u2019s technologies. \nOperating the ring with your thumb while using your finger to touch a device provides powerful capabilities and layers of functionality that are simply not available in today\u2019s technologies. Ringbow multiplies the functionality of your finger together with allowing amazing simultaneous actions.\nRingbow lets you free your fingers from your device, leaving your hands available to do whatever you feel like doing: eating a sandwich, drinking a beer, high-fiving your buddy or stroking a puppy. Whatever you'd choose to do with your hands!\nRingbow innovates touch devices\u2019 gameplay, offering unique additions to existing mobile games as well as developing new games that couldn\u2019t previously be played on touch devices. Ringbow also makes porting consoles games and PC games to mobile devices easier than ever which can be done without affecting and damaging their great experience.\nRingbow in a nutshell;\n* the world's first touch-screen gaming accessory\n* a comfortable ring that you wear on your finger whilst gaming\n* adds layers of functionality to each touch\n* acts as a mouse/joystick device to use for gaming\n* builds a new platform for existing and new games\nAT&T FOUNDRY & RINGBOW - We collaborated with the AT&T Foundry to explore the potential of Ringbow. Take a look at how they envision the Ringbow device - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFJw1ZXFvB0 \nIt simply works\nUsing Ringbow is extremely easy and staggeringly simple. It is designed to provide natural gaming control, similar to the way we operate our console\u2019s controllers. This allows for an intuitive gaming experience and a sense of tactile feedback which greatly enhances the user experience.\nRingbow works on Android, iOS (coming very soon) and supports any Bluetooth enabled device. It works natively with the operating system and with a large variety of existing applications, although our mission is to provide users with brand new cool features. To do that we've partnered with some leading game developers so that Kickstarter supporters will receive a package of exclusive games with their Ringbow. We also hope that you\u2019ll use our API to enhance your own apps so we can add them to our games and apps directory.\nRingbow offers a D-pad style controller, communicates via Bluetooth and lasts 5 hours per charge. The Ringbow box includes:\n- The Ringbow game-ring accessory device\n- Micro-USB cable for charging\n- Ringbow control panel application for Android & iOS devices\n- Game package (see below) including games that were especially designed to support Ringbow, native control of the operating systems and a list of many games that naturally supports Ringbow and works automatically.\n- Developers kit includes the Ringbow APIs and plug-ins, technical support, creative guidelines and 24 hours assistance from our team.\nWe plan on shipping the product in time for the holiday season.\nThis very first Ringbow model is described as a gaming accessory but it can do much, much more. You can use Ringbow for remote browsing while reading; to correct misspelled emails; to act as a remote control for your TV; to answer phone calls while driving; to transform your tablet into a gaming console for your kids;\nBack us and you'll be among the first to get your hands (or should we say fingers!) on a Ringbow\nFor the last 2 years we have been researching the concept of Ringbow and developing the product. We\u2019ve built a number of working prototypes in a variety of ergonomic designs, conducted an impressive commercial pilot with AT&T and recently completed the final Ringbow design and we are now ready to manufacture it for the masses! Prospective partners, distributers and users have recognized Ringbow's great potential, but in order to take the product to the market we need your help.\nYour support will allow us to establish a production line, manufacture the product and expand our games and applications offering so that Ringbow users will enjoy a new and exclusive experience.\nThe funding goal represents the costs of tooling, plastic molds, product certifications and additional software development.\nKICKSTARTER BACKERS WILL BE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE RINGBOW DEVICES ALL OVER THE WORLD.\nWe hope you find Ringbow a powerful and creative tool and hope that you choose to support it.

Frankly, with 84% of Kickstarter projects being late, I would definitely blame project creators more than project backers. Personally, I believe Kickstarter should enact a fine for being delayed, or only give pledge money in installments as the creators achieve set goals. That way creators would have to make progress before receiving all of the money, and it would make creators think twice about the delivery date that they set. I think it is safe to say that project creators set a relatively close delivery date simply to get more support instead of a date that they could actually deliver by.

Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween:\nIt comes ready to use out of the box with everything you see above: MaKey MaKey, Alligator Clips, USB Cable.\nWhat Can I Make?\nThat's up to you! First, load up a computer program or any webpage (yes that's right, you're surfing the internet to invent). \nLet's say you load up a piano. Then, instead of using the computer keyboard buttons to play the piano, you can hook up the MaKey MaKey to something fun, like bananas, and the bananas become your piano keys:  \nOr let's say you Google for an online \"Pacman\" game and draw a joystick with a pencil (yes, an actual ordinary pencil):\nThen you can play Pacman by touching the drawing with your finger.\nOr you could load up facebook or gmail and send a message on a custom-made alphabet soup keyboard:\nHow Does it Work?\nAlligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and an apple.\nWhen you touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input. \nMake + Key = MaKey MaKey! \nWho is MaKey MaKey For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone. Here is an 8-year-old girl in a Maker Space:\nShe invented a \"knife-and-log\" interface for cutting virtual wood in an online game.\nWe ran a workshop in February 2012 with some professors and grad students who specialize in interaction design. One grad student made this beachball game controller:\nAnother grad student made this working pressure sensitive switch by layering Play-Doh under a spring:\nThe workshop took place at Queen's University during a conference.\nWith MaKey MaKey, kids can start inventing right away, and experts can make working prototypes in minutes instead of days.\nWhat materials work with MaKey Makey?\nAny material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work (if it doesn't already work, just rub it with bananas, spray it with water, or apply copper tape). Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.:\nOther materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more...\nRequirements?\nMaKey MaKey works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OSX.\nWhy Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.\nWe are inspired by the Maker Movement. We want to help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the \"Maker's Mindset,\" you know you can change the world.\nBefore we created MaKey MaKey we worked on other creative tools and invention kits such as Drawdio, Singing Fingers, and Scratch.\nWhy Are you Doing a Kickstarter?\nIf we raise $25,000 then we can do a large first run, which brings the retail cost down significantly, so that we can sell the kit to you for $35 (including shipping). We want this to be accessible to beginners, educators, artists, inventors, engineers, and anyone else regardless of income. \nWe are raising Kickstarter money to fund the first large run of MaKey MaKey kits. That is why most of the rewards are kits themselves. That's what we're spending the money on: manufacturing the kits.\nHave You Prototyped This?\nEverything in the video is real, running on either the first or the second prototype. Two years ago, we created the first prototype for MaKey MaKey, and ran a workshop at the San Francisco Exploratorium where people made \"Drum Pants\" and \"Tweet Tea\":\nThen we built the second prototype from 2011 to 2012, and we tested it with professional interaction designers. It looks like this:\nOur third prototype was just made, and will be tested at the Maker Faire and by 100 beta testers. It looks like this: \nNow we are designing the kit a fourth time. This will be the kit you, our KickStarter supporters, will receive. It will look mostly like the third prototype, with some aesthetic modifications.\nHow Are You Manufacturing the Circuits for the Orders Placed on Kickstarter?\nWe are collaborating with the amazing team at Sparkfun. Sparkfun is the perfect choice for us because they make safe, environmentally responsible (RoHS compliant) circuit boards. They are located in the USA (in Boulder, CO), and they treat their employees fantastically. Workers are paid a generous wage with benefits, can bring their dogs to work, listen to music while they work, etc. That may sound like it should be \"normal\", but in the world of circuit production it is very rare and there are lots of sad working conditions elsewhere. Also, Sparkfun is the world's largest manufacturer of Open Source Hardware, which is critical to MaKey MaKey, an all Open Source Hardware project.\nWe worked closely with Jim Lindblom and others from the Sparkfun team to get the board ready for manufacturing. We\u2019re grateful to have them as our partners in this project. With their help we will be done manufacturing and shipping by the end of August. They have a lot of experience meeting deadlines.\nWhat Does the Back of the Board Look Like?\nThe back of the board has hookups for 6 keyboard keys, and mouse control. It also has the open hardware logo, a link for help getting started, and an area for using the board in Arduino mode.\nWait... Is this thing an Arduino?\nYou could say this board is 2 for the price of 1. MaKey MaKey runs on top of Arduino. You can start using your MaKey MaKey board in \"Arduino mode\" at any time. This would allow you to spin motors, turn on LEDs, or anything else that an Arduino can do. If you want to learn to use Arduino or other electronics, but want to start without any programming or breadboarding, MaKey MaKey is a good starting point. There's no need to understand Arduino in order to use MaKey MaKey.\nSeriously, I Am a Geek, Tell Me All the Krazy Tech Stuff\nMaKey MaKey is a printed circuit board with an ATMega32u4 microcontroller running Arduino Leonardo bootloader. It uses the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with your computer, and it can send keypresses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements. For sensing closed switches on the digital input pins, we use high resistance switching to make it so you can close a switch even through materials like your skin, leaves, and play-doh. We use a pull-up resistor of 10-50 mega ohms. This technique attracts noise on the input, so we use a moving window averager to lowpass the noise in software, saving money on hardware filtering. There are six inputs on the front of the board, which can be attached to via alligator clipping, soldering to the pads, or any other method you can think of. There are another 12 inputs on the back, 6 for keyboard keys, and 6 for mouse motion, which you can access with jumpers via the female headers. If you wish to use a different set of keys, or otherwise change the behavior of your MaKey MaKey, you can simply reprogram it using the Arduino environment. By cutting a trace on the back of the board, you can disconnect the large pull-up resistors if you want to, which would be necessary in a small minority of Arduino-style projects. Have more geeky questions? Post them in the comments and we'll answer them. \nOMG This Is Awesome Where Can I Find Out More?\nMaKey MaKey was at Maker Faire in the San Francisco Bay Area on May 19th and May 20th. There were MaKey MaKey giveaways at Maker Faire for teachers, maker space organizers, etc. (limited supplies)\nThe homepage for MaKey MaKey is makeymakey.com\nHere is the Press Page  for photo links etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "OMG Can You Say Invention Gaming System?

The result: Beer Battle! Check it out:\n\nDo that on your desktop, laptop, or tablet! Thanks to all of our friends and backers!\n_________________________________________\nPlaysurface\nWe have a new mechanical and electronic design approach to bring large-format touch computing and home touch tables within reach of ordinary developers and consumers. Our development of Playsurface started by assembling the best open-source optical touch table plans available, and we intend to create a hackable, multi-use, blazingly fast touch computing platform for gaming, music, browsing, device control, and other applications. The goal is to enable cutting-edge performance at a price point that makes buying a touch table similar to many consumer home computer purchases.\nFeatures\nPlaysurface addresses touch table design from both mechanical and electronic design trajectories, and includes:\nA new, application-specific closed-loop digital image processing module to provide touch detection and tracking functions apart from the gaming/application computer\nAn open-hardware cabinet and surface design developed for cost optimization and flat-pack shipping\nA USB interface standard and driver that reduces implementation of the touch table to the same level as plugging in monitor and mouse peripherals\nOnce the development work is done, we will ship you a complete touch table and all of the open-source driver and demo programs needed to get you going right away. With Playsurface, if you can put together Ikea furniture and plug in a new monitor, you can have an incredible touch table.\nWhere We Are\nTempleman Automation (TA) is a contract engineering company with prior sales of inexpensive touch tables in the educational and research sector. This has involved significant work on hardware and software. \nHowever, to make a really great multi-purpose touch computer two critical pieces are still missing and need Kickstarter support:\nThe touch interface must perform the optical touch tracking without taxing the application processor and with minimum system requirements\nA specialized hardware design is required to match the new electronics architecture and meet all materials, shipping, and home-assembly requirements\nTA has a design to address these issues and wants to make the resulting touch table available to the world as an open-source hardware and software project!\nWhy We Need Funding\nTouch computing has innumerable commercial opportunities. We meet people every day with skills and ideas that should be applied to touch tables.  We are using Kickstarter to generate the start-up funding necessary to create a finished platform to drive application creation. Our Playsurface Kickstarter rewards have low overhead to maintain our low-cost vision, and we hope to sell units commercially after the Kickstarter. \nBut we need both initial orders and funding for tooling costs to create the next generation of touch tables!  \nThanks for any and all help Kickstarters!\nHere is a new movie to show some of the things you can do with Playsurface right out of the box with Windows 7:\nHere is another short movie about playing games on Playsurface:\nHere is another one by popular request showing Playsurface with a few of the Microsoft Touch Pack applications - designed by Microsoft to show off the multitouch capabilities of Windows 7:\nIn response to questions about fiducial tracking with the Playsurface, here is a new video showing two applications we have made:\nHere is another movie showing Playsurface running MapTool to spice up board and roll playing gaming!\nHere is another one showing music editing with a virtual mixer and digital recording system:\nWe have had such a great response from the RPG crowd, we thought we would show a few more tools that work great with Playsurface.
