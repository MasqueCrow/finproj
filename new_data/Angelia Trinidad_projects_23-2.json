Unfortunately, a lot of the products in the market complicate the process and don\u2019t accomplish what they claim.  That\u2019s why we created the Base and Balls. We wanted a better, more cost-effective, simple solution to help you get the relief you deserve -- in the comfort of your own home, at the gym, during a break at work, or when traveling. \nPlus, due to safety or financial restrictions \u2013 more people are staying home -- not many of us have the option of going out to get professional massages or investing in expensive gear. The average Joe just needs something simple and effective. Meet The Base and Balls -- where simple, modern design meets patent pending technology to target tight, sore, and strained muscles.\nWhen my team and I started to design the base and balls system we wanted to ensure it would be a product that could bring you relief, anywhere without breaking your budget.  \nThe device is literally just a base and 3 custom massage balls. Don\u2019t let the simple design fool you. The patent-pending system has been designed with my 8 year experience in the industry with the last 3 years spent on research and development to get us to bring this product to you. The Base with its detachable interlocking ball is made with your comfort, convenience, and relief in mind.  \nThe base and ball system is customizable and expandable.  You can use one or two units to personalize your relief. You can even customize the pressure with the included 3 custom made for the Base massage Balls which provide varying degrees of pressure.\nMeasuring just 4x2 inches, the Base is truly the world's most compact, convenient, and travel-friendly massage and pain relief recovery device. Small yet powerful enough to handle all muscle types and weighs less than one pound!\nThe base uses a custom-designed \u201cmassage ball\u201d which is attached to a revolutionary accessory to optimize compression and assist with one of my favorite massage techniques \u201cpress and stretch\u201d. \u201cPress and stretch\u201d makes the mobility exercise and massage active, which creates a more effective way to relax, and get the body ready to carry over to real-life activity. Owning the Base is like having your personal therapist ready to help you 24/7. \nThe base and balls can travel with you.  Whether you\u2019re at home, the office, gym, or traveling via car or plane, it\u2019s now possible to take care of yourself anywhere, anytime.  Trust us, you won't want to leave home without it!     \nThe base and balls system has been tested on individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and fitness levels.  It's also easy to clean! \nCheck out what some of our early users have to say about the benefits they felt with the base and balls.\nYou don't have to lug around chargers, batteries, or large bags to take the device with you. It fits in the palm of your hands, can be sanitized top to bottom, and made to provide you relief for a long time.\nThe Base is designed for maximum performance using variable resistance silicone to give you the feel of human touch. Utilizing a patent-pending interchangeable, 3 ball system, the Base makes it easy to quickly switch to your desired firmness level...allowing your muscles to relax into the base and melt your tension away. Powerful enough to handle all muscle types, the base weighs less than one pound!\nMany of you know me through my social media channels as JoeTherapy. My real name is Joe Yoon. I\u2019m a massage therapist and author of the best selling book, Better Stretching.  I started my social channels to teach people simple ways to stretch and move better.  I wrote my book to simplify complex techniques for the everyday Joe that\u2019s just looking to move and feel better.  \nMy team and I have now created the base to allow you to do all this -- in the palm of your own hands. I am excited to get this into your hands in 2021 with the help of this kickstarter campaign!\nLow Back Pain - Low Back Massage\nPlantar Fasciitis Relief - Foot Massage\nTight Shoulders - Trap Massage \n Tight Hamstrings - Hamstring Massage  \n Poor Posture?

But, that's also the the fun part of backing a Kickstarter campaign...you are joining our team for the ride as we bring these products to market. Yes, you are taking on a little more risk than if you waited until these products were available on our website. But you're also receiving a reward: you'll get the Base in your palms first, and at a significant discount (up to 50% off!). \n\nSupply Chain Risks\nWe\u2019ve built a good relationship with our manufacturer and freight forwarder. Still there\u2019s a lot in the supply chain we can not control. There\u2019s space for things to go wrong. A machine at the manufacturer may break down. The ports may go on strike. These can cause a delay in fulfillment. \n\nDelayed Fulfillment\nThe fulfillment of rewards may be delayed for a few reasons: 1) Supply chain risks mentioned above or 2) our Kickstarter campaign BLOWS UP! (Of course, we\u2019d prefer the latter.) We promise we\u2019ll do our best to ensure that the Base gets into our supporter's hands A-S-A-P while taking care of the well-being of our team. Our target date to get it to you is March/April 2021 or sooner if we are lucky!\n\nUnforeseen Quality Risks\nWe have worked with our manufacturer to ensure that our supporters receive products of the highest quality. Since The Base and Balls is an entirely new product, we cannot guarantee that it will be perfect. We kindly ask you to use this product with an open mind. We strive to provide the best products to help you live your best life, so feedback is always welcome! If you aren\u2019t satisfied with your Base, we\u2019ll stick by our Promise\u2014a full refund, no questions asked. Just send us a message!\n\nHow will we overcome these risks and challenges?\nTransparency. Through Kickstarter updates, we promise to let you know when things go wrong, right, up, and down. We wouldn\u2019t be here if it weren\u2019t for you. All that we ask from you is for your patience and continued support. You can always send us a message if you have any questions.\n\nWhat if I no longer want to take the risk?\nWe can not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges on items received as Kickstarter rewards. The support our team gets from our Kickstarter backers is what enables us to complete our development and production process, run and grow our small business, and design new awesome products for the future.

Get a full sized workout, pack it down in seconds and store it next to your sneakers\nWhipr is also great for travel as it packs easily in your carry on bag (along with accessories) and is permitted to fly on airplanes... we've done it many times. \nWhipr started out as a way to replicate stand up paddling. Once the prototype was built and we started testing we realized it was so much more. Whipr is now a platform for many cardio and rep based exercises and the ecosystem can and will expand. Currently whipr has three primary modalities (exercises): \nStand up paddling\nCross country skiing\nRowing\nEach modality uses the same whipr base unit and is enabled by the use of accessories. You may purchase the whole package or choose just the accessories you need to match your training and exercise needs. Whipr will accept any handles, straps or bars commonly used on a regular gym cable machine (carabiner attachments)\nSwitching modalities is as simple as swapping whipr's orientation and accessories. This takes takes around 15 seconds so it's easy to set up HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) sets using all three modalities. \nWhipr can be used with any cable machine attachments, like these velcro leg cuffs.\nAdditional modalities\nSWIMMING/SURFING - Using two base units you can use our forthcoming swim and surf accessory for dry land practice and training. All backers who select two base units will recieve the swim accessory for free. \nKAYAKING - This is a much requested modality and again would need two units. We do not have plans within the scope of this campaign to release a kayak accessory but we do have one in development and intend to release it soon. Please see Update #13 for details.\nGOLF, HOCKEY, SOCCER & MORE - In the same spirit of home mods we've heard from backers who plan to use whipr by attaching it to hockey sticks, golf clubs or to ankle   bands for kicking and glute work. We've tested these and they work great! Any ankle bands with a carabiner will work and they're all readily available on amazon. \nAfter much market research we decided to offer the whipr base unit on its own and add accessories so our backers can mix and match accessories to suit their needs. This keeps costs down for you and allows for ultimate customization. \nWhen pledging, please manually change the pledge amount to match the combination of base unit(s) and accessories you wish to receive. If you have already checked out you may do this manually in your account by modifying your pledge. \nIf you have any pledge questions just reach out via the contact button and we'll assist. \n The whipr base unit is essentially a miniaturized rowing machine \nwith multiple modalities (exercises). It completely replaces the big, bulk rowing machines and ski-ergs that you'd usually only find in a gym, in fact to purchase equivalent quality machines for all three modalities would cost you over $4,000 and fill up a small bedroom. Whipr will cost you less than 10% of that amount and it's around half the size of a basketball.   \nGet $4,000+ worth of functionaty for less than 10%\nKey Specifications\nSize =  6.2\"x6\"x6\" (16cm) \nWeight = 6.7lbs (2.7kg) (Production model will likely be lighter) \nPull cord length = 10 ft (3m)\nResistance on the catch (pull) phase of stroke = at its highest it's about the same as a full sized rowing machine on mid-high setting, at it's lowest it's an easier but  challenging resistance suitable for ski-erg and paddling. There are 5 levels of resistance in total that can be identified by numbers on the dial. \nRetraction resistance = none\nResistance Mechanism\nThe primary source of resistance is the planetary gearbox. Just like water, our gearbox is harder to get moving then keep moving. So once you build momentum whipr rewards your consistency with a slightly easier catch and pull (stroke), just like on the water. Additional resistance is achieved by increasing or decreasing the resistance wheel which engages magnetic resistance on the inside. You can read more about the engineering below.\nFeatures\nOn the front of whipr is the pull cord, the digital screen and the inflate and deflate buttons for the inbuilt anchor. The rear of the unit features the resistance adjustment wheel as well as the inflatable anchor (the flap on the back) and the removable webbing anchor for anchoring whipr to any fixed object.\nFront view showing pull cord, digital screen and inflatable anchor controls\nRear view showing adjustment wheel. Webbing anchor is installed.\nPrototype notes\nThe images you see here are of the prototype. Improvements already planned for the production model are:\nIncreased size of the inflatable anchor to cater for large door sizes and carpeted rooms\nFinalized the magnetic closure on door anchor to secure it in place \nProduction model will be lighter, run quieter, smoother and have more variability in resistance (similar resistance to full sized rowing machines on mid-high setting)\nFinalized design of the digital screen (see below for more)\nUpdated the logo\n As part of our partnership with Rich we're producing a limited edition base station with black accents coupled with our complete package. The package also features two bonus fitness programs including a free month of his own MayhemNation.com. The package is available now in limited quantities.\nIn re-thinking the ERG machine we first had to figure out how to secure it. Anchoring to a door was the obvious choice but we didn't want to be limited, so we added a webbing anchor which allows attachment to any fixed object like a tree, couch leg, fence post or tent peg. Basically anything that is heavy or securely fixed to the ground. Whipr is supplied with a webbing strap for objects up to 24\" however any webbing up to 2\" wide will work.\nInflatable door anchor in horizontal and vertical modes\nNEW: Thanks to a stretch goal, backers will now have an option to upgrade their units to have bluetooth connectivity. See update #12 for details\nAn ergometer, or ERG, is simply a device that measures work or energy expended during a period of physical exercise. Our onboard computer will display common metrics and features such as:\nPer minute stroke rate\nTotal reps/strokes\nCount up/down timer\nTotal distance\nTime to complete distance\nCalories burned\n500m split \nFurther, our app anable more customization and metrics. The exact details of the app are yet to be finalized. \nOur stand up paddle shaft has been developed in collaboration with Black Project SUP, manufacturers of world championship winning paddles and fins. The paddle shaft collapses into 3 pieces and is length adjustable to suit any height. The pieces are each 17.5\" long and will easily fit inside a carry on bag (typical carry on bag height is 22-24\").\nThe paddle shaft is a special blend of carbon fiber that is softer then normal paddles to give it a distinctive 'alive' feeling in your hands. We've spent a lot of time playing with the right compounds to get it just right and the action is endorsed by world championship paddlers. To attach the paddle shaft simply clip the carabiner onto the whipr base unit.\nOur paddle shaft, perfectly sized for travel and for paddlers large and small.\nTrain outdoors by anchoring to almost any fixed object. Great for bootcamps!\nThe cross country skiing accessory functions similarly to ski-ergs you'll find in high-end and cross fit gyms. Resistance is engaged with both arms (isolated single arm resistance would require two whipr base units). We've built this accessory to be compact and travel easily while retaining full fluid motion.  \nTo use the ski attachment simply unfold it, hook it over a door frame, attach the pulley to the whipr base unit hook and start skiing. The cord length is adjustable with a convenient system built into the handles and when you're finished it folds down to just 10\"x4\" for easy storage and travel. \nSki attachment folded for storage/travel\nSki attachment cable length adjustment\nThe rowing accessory was a true engineering challenge! It gives the feeling and action of a full sized rower while being extremely compact. When you're finished training, the rower folds down in around 60-90 seconds and can be easily stored.\nRower Specifications:\nWeight limit = 350lbs\nTotal length = 72\" (1.82m) inclusive of the mounted base unit and feet\nTotal height = 20\" (50cm) inclusive of the mounted base unit and feet \nTrack length = 50\" (1.29m) from middle of foot placement to rear seat position. Suitable for individuals with an inseam of 38\" or less (individuals up to 6'6\")\nSeat height = 8\" (20cm) from floor to seat position\nSeat to pull cord distance = 9.5\" (24cm)\nExact dimensions are subject to slight change\nUpdated wire frame CAD drawing of the final rower design\nPrototype notes \nThe photos you see here are of the prototype. Improvements in the production model are covered in our Update #11 and are displayed in the wire-frame above. To summarize we have\nRaised and slightly lengthened the track. The foot plates are now located below the hips and ergonomics have been improved\nAdded non-slip feet (the previous version had non slip on the base, but this new version will perform slightly better on all flooring surfaces)\nWobble in the track and the pedestal mount under high intensity loads has been eliminated\nImproved the method of attachment between the base unit and the pedestal (no more screw holding it in place)\nSeat may be locked in place to accommodate different styles of paddling and adaptive users\nFoot straps are longer and no longer velcro. Adjustment will be made with a more conventional double backed tension pull just as used on most full sized rowers\nFaster setup and disassembly with quick connects, no small parts to lose\nEasy snap down tension setting for solid rail feel and structural rigidity\nFlatter, padded seat\nRower accessory taken apart (full deconstruct takes 60-90 seconds)\nPlenty of room to spare when packed for travel\nDemo of swimming action. User is laying on a foam roller to allow clearance on stroke. Two whipr units are used, one for each arm.\n The Swim & Surf accessory was put into development by the $500k stretch goal! We will share images in our updates as it is developed. Here's how it to set it up:\nAnchor 2 x whipr base units under a door at a width that is suitable for your shoulder width. For example, if you have wide shoulders you'll set them further apart then someone with narrower shoulders. You can really fine tune the placement for your individual stroke which is a very unique feature of whipr. \nThe Swim & Surf accessory will comprise of two handle paddles that attach to the whipr cord. Connect these to the base unit.\nPosition your own bench (such as a weight training bench, a Reebok step, cooler or tall foam block)  a few feet from the anchor point, centered with the base units.  \nFor swimming we suggest laying on your back as it frees up your lungs to work, visualize that the bench is the air and the air above you is the water. For surfing we recommend laying on your stomach as this accuratly recreates the feeling of laying on a board and paddling. \nConcentrate on your form and pull through the resistance exactly as you would on your board or in the water. \nAll backers who select 2 base units (by adding $200 to their pledge) will receive the Swim & Surf accessory as a bonus with their shipment.\nWe looked at traditional rowing machines and how they provide resistance, decided to completely scrap all conventions and design the ultimate portable ERG machine from the ground up. \nTo get the gearing right we started with an over-size unit, similar in size to a rowing machine you'd see at a gym, this enabled us to develop a proprietary planetary gearbox and clutch system that provides smooth resistance and a realistic paddling/rowing/skiing experience. \nPrototype #1 - Early development of the planetary gearbox\nThe challenge was to create resistance that is harder to get moving than it is to keep moving, just like in real life when the forward momentum of a paddler or skier results in easier stroke action, as long as momentum is maintained.\nPrototype #1\nPrototype #1 allowed the development of the planetary gearbox which we then miniaturized to create prototype #2. We also increased the resistance overall and added additional magnetic resistance so that your workout experience can be individualized.\nOnce we had the miniaturized planetary gearbox adjusted just right it was time to figure out how to secure whipr to a common object and make it as functional and portable as possible. We got the anchors dialed in and the whipr base unit was born.\n We love stretch goals!\nHere is what we have in the works so far, more may be added during the campaign. \n\"There I was sitting in a hotel looking at yet another filthy hotel gym thinking, why can\u2019t I just get paddle fit wherever I want to? I searched around for a portable rowing machine, a sup machine or ski machine and found that nothing existed, so I built one that does all three.\" - whipr Inc.

He spends a lot of  time on the road, living out of hotels and boats filming documentaries for Discovery Channel. Having founded whipr he's now working full time to make it a reality. \nTo build whipr he's teamed up with with Shape Products out of Toronto Canada. Their engineering and design firm have been in business for 30 years and have a long and solid history of bringing products to market, from inception through to production with their manufacturing partners. \nAlso contributing as an advisor and paddle shaft manufacture is Chris Freeman, CEO and founder of Black Project SUP in Maui, Hawaii. His company makes world championship winning paddles and fins for stand up paddle-boards, surfboards and windsurfers.\nAs a team we're ready to hit go on production.\nMany Kickstarter campaigns have disappointed their backers by not thinking through their shipping and logistics strategy. That's why we're pleased to let you know that we've partnered with a global fulfillment and logistics company, Floship, and passed their 7 point comprehensive review. You can read about it by clicking the image below.\nShipping times\nWe will ship all rewards (except the limited edition black model) in February 2021. Actual delivery date may be up to 4 weeks later depending on your territory. Black models will ship in March.  \nWhipr is pleased to work with floship to ensure efficient and cost effective reward deliver.

This is a professionally prepared estimate and prices may go up or down depending on your choice of accessories and global shipping rates when we get to the fulfillment stage. We will strive diligently to achieve the right balance of shipping speed and cost efficiency for our backers.\nSample shipping rates as of September 14, 2020\nIn partnership with\nAs seen on", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo Kickstarter project is without risk, but we've worked hard to assemble the right team to mitigate any unforeseen challenges that may present themselves along the way.\n\nAs the first of its kind, whipr is bound to make a splash in the industry. Knowing that we're doing something big here we've made sure that every step of our production timeline is protected by using trusted partners and realistic timelines. Every team member and manufacturing partner has delivered on products like this before, we know the business and the industry and there are no long shots involved.\n\nWe already have working prototypes of the whipr base unit and the accessories. There's no code to go wrong or electronics to bug test (aside from the digital display which is quite simple) and the molds are ready to be made, we're just waiting on the funding to do it.\n\nHowever, it is important for backers to understand that sometimes timelines can change. For example, manufacturing and shipping has been delayed for some projects due to such things as viruses and travel restrictions. Right now we don't see that as being a problem as our supply chain is back up to full operations, but we are aware that the future risk of delay exists. \n\nWe know it's frustrating to back a project and only hear crickets when asking about where the project is at, you won't get that from us. We commit to you, our backer, to be completely transparent along the way. You will receive regular updates on where we're at the the process, even when the only news is that we're on track and proceeding. \n\nWe look forward to delivery on, or ahead, of time and getting whipr into every home, gym and bag of fitness enthusiasts around the world.

This design helps provide stability, power, safety and accuracy.\nShielded stainless steel blades\nHold FLYK in any position without getting hurt. Carry it in your pocket without ripping clothes or piercing skin. Your kids can use it and you can even toss it to a friend without concern for injury. Can you say that for other scissors, box cutters or envelope openers? Probably not.\nFLYK features cutting edge, super-heated and hardened long lasting stainless steel blades housed in a design that feels so good in your hands that you may arbitrarily start looking for stuff to open.\nFLYK\u2019s magnet and magnetic mount allow for FLYK to be placed wherever you want it to be, ready at a moment's notice. Most of us retrieve our package opening devices (scissors, razors and knives) from a drawer in the kitchen, or near our workbench or work area. Even if you choose to store FLYK in a drawer, the shielded blades prevent you from getting hurt.\nFLYK\u2019s body is made of Arboblend, a thermoplastic composed of three natural components: lignin, cellulose fibers and natural additives. It can easily be molded and is therefore called 'liquid wood'. By using biodegradable material, FLYK\u2019s body will break down to become part of the earth should you ever lose your FLYK or accidentally toss it in the trash.\nAdditionally, FLYK can help you cut up boxes or plastic for recycling purposes, taking care of the environment even more. We're teaming up with environmental groups across the globe so that we can help support efforts to mitigate human impact on the environment through the sales of FLYK.\nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more. \nFLYK Products, LLC founder Robert Behan faced package opening frustrations for a long time. He watched his friends and family struggle to open multiple tiers of packaging. Not only did the plastic/cardboard/box battle take away some of the joy and momentum of opening gifts, but it was also frustrating, bothersome, and unsafe. People were reaching for scissors, keys, knives, screwdrivers and more in efforts to get things out. It was in that moment that he started brainstorming an easier, safer, faster way to open packages. He sketched a design, purchased molding clay and created an initial mockup. He recruited help from an engineer friend, and spent the past year working on the final design and prototype.\nMaking COVID-19 work \nProducing eco friendly products is just the beginning. COVID-19 has changed the way all of us across the planet live our lives and many who\u2019ve been forced to work from home have come to appreciate the benefits and healthier lifestyle of being with family, time alone or hanging with our pets. And FLYK, Products wants to help promote this lifestyle. Starting with our first parts run, instead of having a faceless factory construct each FLYK, we\u2019ll look to employ individuals and families with the desire to work from home, where they can assist us with assembly and shipment of FLYK package openers to our customers. Over the past months, our team has worked diligently at making home assembly and automated shipping a reality not only benefiting individuals and families wanting to work from home but also the planet, by reducing delivery distances thus decreasing CO2 output and giving back to local communities through programs of cleanup and contribution with those we bring on board. This is just one approach FLYK Products is implementing in order help elevate human spirits, prevent and cleanup waste and work with other companies to make packaging of all kinds, healthier for all of us. \nWe can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make FLYK a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or pre-order FLYK, if you\u2019re a supporter of FLYK, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this.

Originally we looked into materials that would biodegrade and we were happy with this way of thinking. Not to rest on ones laurels, we challenged ourselves with the question, \u201ccould we be greener?\u201d In short, the answer was yes. The materials to manufacture FLYK\u2019s biodegradable version would have come from discarded plant sources which take a great deal of energy to process. So we were really excited when we discovered a material that uses less energy to manufacture, is made of recycled materials and is recyclable at the end of its life cycle.

In testing we have measured run times at approx:\n95 mins at MAX | 140 mins at MID | 240 mins at LOW.\nAnd full charge from flat is around 2 hrs. *Subject to battery age and weather conditions.\nBut with our stretch goals achieved, we can now upgrade the size of this battery by 1.5X to a 1500mAh battery - which will increase these timings.\nUSB-C allows for operation while charging, so if a need ever arises the unit can be run from a power source.\nAs we are injection moulding the diffusion panel, we will have full control of elements that effect the panel opacity (we'll be experimenting with the mix of composite ingredients / diffusing powders that give a glow effect etc). Once we have the tooling complete and can experiment with these options, fine tuning will take place to balance the LED outputs VS the diffusion opacity. As a result run times may vary up or down slightly in final production model.\nWhile CRI is a commonly cited score, as a film professional, a more important rating is the Television Lighting Consistency Index or TLCI.  It also runs from 0-100.  Our LED rating of 98+ puts us in the range where any colour variation is so small, a film colourist would not consider correcting it.  \n\nWe've been hard at work over the past three weeks confirming the final details of our tooling setup - we have paid and signed our contract and have been working on the finer points of the design, with tool cutting due to commence any day. We have opted to work with a higher precision tooling company as it will both allow us to produce more units faster, and also deliver a product with a higher quality finish.  \nWe're also excited to announce that since we can now order at higher volume, we have been able to negotiate some rates and add a couple of pretty cool features that will now be shipped with every BIGSOFTI.\nAnd after hitting our $650K Stretch Goal today - every single BIGSOFTI shipped to every backer will now have a 1500mAh battery!\n\nMy name is Al Morrow, I'm a Sydney-based TV commercial director who\u2019s worked with global brands in both Australia and the US for over a decade.  \nI'm the guy who walks into a room and has to fight the urge to adjust the lights. Lighting quality literally affects how we see the world, and yet so many people hardly give it enough thought.\nAl Morrow lining up the frame on recent Volkswagen TV Commercial.\nI know how important lighting is when filming, well, anything and because I shoot photos and videos on my phone all the time, I wanted to bring the same kind of high-quality light that I use on my film sets to my mobile.\nEven though I\u2019d been thinking of ways to bring film lighting to my phone, my \u2018aha\u2019 moment for BIGSOFTI didn\u2019t come on set or even during a shoot. It came one day in the car. My wife was driving and her sister was in the backseat; taking selfie after selfie. She was holding up a jacket to cut out the direct sunlight and complaining that her photos either had too many hard shadows or were being blasted by the phone flash.\nI commented to her, that without her knowing it, she was cutting and shaping light in a similar way that we would on a film set and that if she wanted full control of her image, she\u2019d need to have a small, powerful, soft light with her. Her face lit up (no pun intended) 'that would be great!'. Many months later, she was the first person we started our tests on, comparing our soft light to the hard light of the phone flash.\nNote the harsh light and hard focussed shadow from the single point LED on the phone (top left) VS much softer spread from BIGSOFTI (top right).\nThat was when I realised this was not just a product I would use. Everyone (director or not), uses cameras and anyone shooting photos or videos needs good light.\nThe first thing I did when I got home that evening was to look at what products already existed in this space. There were phone cases that seemed cumbersome. Products that were made with cheap, low-quality LEDs. Lighting attachments that were too big, too heavy, too expensive.\nThere seemed to be a gap in the market! I was curious to see if we could address these design flaws and make something better - and the BIGSOFTI journey began.\nBIGSOFTI began with me in my office pulling apart LED products I bought on ebay and hacking bits together but it really shifted gear when I brought on the team at Vert Design. \nI was impressed by both their enthusiasm and their experience (they had designed products for clients such as SONY, INTEL, BMW and DEUS among others) and, from the outset, our partnership was a perfect combination of my knowledge of lighting and photography and their passion for user-focused design.\nWe set off on two things: 1. Start on initial designs. 2. Find the right manufacturing partner.\nThroughout the process, Head Designer Andrew Simpson spoke about product design being a 'swinging pendulum' between tech functionality and human interaction. Swing too far in one direction you lose the core practicality of the product, too far in the other direction and you lose the great user experience. We needed to make a product that was the perfect combination of both.\nInitially, we created a light panel that would attach to the underside of a flip-out phone case. We found that while the function of the light module worked well, the user interaction with the design was lacking. We showed it to family, friends and colleagues who loved the effect of the lighting, but not the experience so we went back to the drawing board.\nWe explored fixed universal clips, magnetic blocks, locking rubber lugs, even a metal arm and shoe mount. We were split on the clip VS rubber lug and so decided to run some market research through the digital platform OnePulse, asking a focus group of 500 men and women 18-35, across the UK and US which design they preferred. A resounding eighty-five per cent said the clip-on design.\nOur direction became very clear. Several iterations later, we now have a rotating, removable mechanism (patent pending), which houses a universal clip for all leading smartphone, tablet and laptop brands. Plus the additional features of a cold shoe camera mount with \u00bc\u201d 20 thread mount and the 3M Adhesive Mount for general surfaces. It\u2019s this simple versatility that helps put BIGSOFTI into its own category - being effortlessly transferrable across all your devices. \nWe had our design, now we needed to get it made. After a false start with our initial manufacturer (bad communication, high costs, lack of knowledge and lack of passion about the product) we were put in touch with a man named Hunter Ho; an LED lighting product specialist.\nDuring our first meeting with Hunter, we discussed the technical requirements of LED numbers, size, spacing and distance, colour temp,  CRI and TLCI ratings, the diffusing materials, batteries and charge times, circuits and regulatory approval checks. Hunter had an answer to all our questions and within a few days had sent us itemised quotes with unit numbers, costs, recommendations and timelines.\nWith Hunter\u2019s input we were able to improve the lighting board and PCB layout, update the charge port to USB-C and increase the battery size and run time.  But most importantly, we were able to update the quality of our LEDs. We are now working with specialised, photography grade BI-COLOUR LEDs, so new that they may have never been used in a device this small before. They deliver changeable colour temperature functionality - with options for all scenarios - DAYLIGHT (5500K), TUNGSTEN (3000K) and a CLEAN MIX (4000K). Which means awesome colour reproduction for better images. We are super confident in our design and just as confident in our manufacturer. \nDuring these uncertain times in the world, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we believe these prices should return to normal as the global situation improves. To therefore minimise costs for our backers, we will not be charging the current higher shipping charges at the time of pledging.\nShipping, Taxes (and VAT / GST) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign, just before we ship out to our supporters.  This is being managed through BackerKit who will be in contact via email. \nWe will be working hard to secure you the best shipping prices. The good news is that BIGSOFTI is small and lightweight, so any multipack purchases will be charged as only single postage fees, so please consider ordering for someone else too, to help us cut down on shipping costs and air miles.\nWe were always planning to launch BIGSOFTI in the first few months of this year, and obviously things have been a little held up by this very strange and difficult time out there.\nWe\u2019ve stayed across developments of COVID-19 from the very beginning, as news of the pandemic first began to spread in China. We have adjusted our delivery timelines to take into consideration any delays that might be encountered as we move into tooling and production.\nCOVID-19 is certainly going to impact the way we work and communicate for the next little while. There is generally a movement towards remote working and this is only going to increase, and with that, comes adjusting to the new norm of endless video calls both for personal and business reasons. \nWe know there is a lot about social distancing that has been difficult.  Never-ending video calls is just one minor impact of the current situation.  But if BIGSOFTI can help solve this one little problem then great.\nWe couldn't have got where we are today, without lots of help from family and friends. This whole thing has been done as lean as possible. From learning how to build a website, to hassling my poor friends to be in the videos. Harassing my brother Matt to help me film things. To asking my wife Jan for feedback during scripting. And a couple of favours finishing the content with Chris at White Chocolate in Darlington, and Tone at Rumble Studios in Chippendale. So to all those people - a huge thanks. Literally could not have done it without you all.\nChief Technology Cat analysing LED spectrum lab reports. LOL - No he's not. He's a moron.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working on developing BIGSOFTI for nearly 24 months now and have built some great working relationships with our manufacturing partners.\n\nIf we are successful with our campaign, the team are ready to push the button on the tool making. As soon as we hit our funding goal, we can afford to pay the invoice at the factory to begin tooling.\n\nWe have every element fully costed out - so know exactly how to deliver BIGSOFTI out to customers - but as professionals with very high standards, we have identified a few risks that you should be made aware of that include:\n\n\n1 - Manufacturing Schedule\n \nWe know things are going to be a little backed up with the factories as China moves back to full capacity, and this has been factored into our production timings. We have outlined a longer delivery time-frame of 6 months in the hopes that we will end up being able to deliver earlier than expected. \n\nWe are working with a very experienced mould maker to manage our injection moulding process and a top electronic engineer and LED consultant to drive the component acquisition and circuitry construction.\n\nIt is critical to fully 'tune' the injection mould tooling to ensure we deliver BIGSOFTI to our high standards. The process of 'tuning the mould' has been described as sometimes more art than science. It can be quick or a can take a few passes to refine. The time to do this has been factored in, but if they nail it quickly, then it might be faster. But we will not be producing the first run of product until we are happy with the samples to make sure you will be too.\n\nWe can guarantee however to be fully transparent with communication updates so you guys know exactly how things are moving along. We want to make sure you love BIGSOFTI as much as we do - and won't ship until we know you will.\n\n\n2 - Shipping and Handling\n\nWe think it's important to get BIGSOFTI out to you guys nice and quickly, but at the lowest cost possible.\nGlobal freight and shipping is currently under the weight of massive demand and the road blocks of fewer flights and tighter borders. As such, costs for shipping are up (sometimes 2-3X) - which unfortunately is driving up our material and manufacturing costs somewhat, but this is something that we are absorbing at this stage to get BIGSOFTI off the ground.\n\nOur shipping team are set to pack and send BIGSOFTI as soon as it's ready to go - but as with any postage, we cannot control the amount of time it takes once it leaves our warehouse. Global freight is currently burdened during this health crisis so timings and costings will be effected. We hope by the time we are ready to ship, that access has returned to some level of normality. But our plan is to maintain good constant communication with all backers so everyone is kept well informed.\n\nIn order to give you the most competitive pricing on shipping, we will not be charging shipping and taxes through Kickstarter but will be charging it closer to our delivery dates through BackerKit. With costs far higher than normal at the moment, but the assumption that things should return closer to normal over the next few months, we hope to get BIGSOFTI out to you guys for the cheapest possible price. \n\nWe're working through trusted partners here so we're confident things will be fine, but please be patient as sometimes little hiccups in their system can cause a short (but understandably annoying) delay. \n\n\n3 - Minimum Orders\n\nBacking our project is not the same thing as buying an off the shelf photography light. It is about supporting our idea that professional lighting principles should be available simply and easily across all your devices. \n\nTo make this possible, we need to build enough support here in the KICKSTARTER community to get us over the line. This support will finally help us bring all our hours of research and development to life in BIGSOFTI.\n\nTo help make this idea a reality, we need your help in spreading the word.\n\nIf you like the look of BIGSOFTI, please click the green button and back our campaign. And please share it with anyone you think might also benefit from better quality lighting in their pocket. \n\nEvery pledge we get helps bring us one step closer to getting BIGSOFTI into your hands, as quickly as possible, and for the lowest possible price.

This series will approach the art and craft of type design from multiple angles, such as providing plenty of historical context in addition to practical insights into the type design process. Instruction for software tutorials will also be covered in depth using Glyphs App, a popular font design application. If this project is funded beyond the initial goal, I\u2019m aiming to cover material that is discussed in intermediate type courses in addition to the foundations, such as how to expand your design into type families, how to use calligraphy in your design process, and more. \n(See \ud83d\udcdaTable of Contents below for details!)\nWho is this for?\nGraphic designers, typographers, lettering artists, calligraphers, basically anyone who loves letterforms! Even if your goal isn't about becoming a professional type designer, there's many aspects of the letterform design process that is helpful for many related disciplines. After all, letters are the building blocks of communication design!\nTrade Gothic Display, designed by Lynne Yun, released by Monotype\nIntroduction\nTraditional access to a type design education involves resources and classes with financial or geographical barriers. I want to create this series because I feel strongly that the graphic design and type design community would benefit from having an accessible, affordable type design course, available from anywhere in the world.\nWhile I have had the idea for this online course for a long time, the transition to online learning during this pandemic has been eye-opening as an educator. I've been teaching in-person classes for a few years, but the past semester has been a trial-by-fire where all learning had to happen remotely. With everything happening in the world, I feel that the community would benefit from having an accessible, affordable type design course now more than ever.\nJust like my full semester classes, this course will be a mixture of type history, practical knowledge, and software demonstrations using Glyphs App. I'm a professional type designer who taught type design, lettering, and calligraphy for a number of educational institutions \u2014 you can check out my bio below.\nTL;DR: I'm hoping to make an affordable & comprehensive online video series on type design! \nAmpersandist, designed by Lynne Yun, released by FutureFonts\n \ud83d\udcda What Will You Learn? \nHere is the list of topics that I am planning for this course, along with estimated minimum video length to show how much I anticipate going in-depth for these topics. \n Foundations of Type Design: (1.5 hr+)\nThe anatomy of type\nTypeface classification\nOptical compensation\nPlotting Vector Points\nLanguages vs. scripts\n Designing Your Typeface: (5 hrs+)\n(Note: The class demos will use Glyphs App & Adobe InDesign)\nIdeation \nEstablish brief/parameters\nSketching\nCommon Novice Design Pitfalls\nDigitization\nDrawing B\u00e9zier Curves\nSetting Font Info Values & Features\nSpacing\nCharacter Sets\nProofing\nKerning\nNotes on Production/Finishing\nThe History of Type & Technology (1.5hr+)\nOrigin of the Alphabet\nThe Art of the Written Letter\nEarly Typefaces\nModern Typefaces\nContemporary Typefaces\n Educational Resources for Type (0.5hr+)\nArchives & Resources for Type (online, in-person, & books)\nRecommended Drawing Exercises\nWhere can I find and try out fonts in the wild?\nTrade Gothic Inline, designed by Lynne Yun, released by Linotype\n\ud83d\udea9 Stretch Goals \nAfter the initial funding goals are met, any additional funding will go towards expanding the course content to explain topics that go beyond the basics. \nTD;LR: Help me create the most in-depth type design course ever posted on the internet!\n(~ $5000 Total) Diving Deeper into Type Design \nWhat is Hinting?\nOpentype Features\nTypes of Numerals\nDesigning Accented Characters\n(~$7000 Total) Designing Type Families \nWhat Are Type Families?\nExtensions of Design Axis\nDesigning Bolder & Lighter Weights\nConsiderations for Optical Sizing\nDesigning the Italic Style\nWhat is a Variable Font?\n(~$7500 Total) Type as Technology\nHow Do Letters Appear on the Screen?\nWhat is Unicode?\nWhat is Hinting?\nFont as Software (EULA/licensing considerations)\nDetails of OpenType Features\nDifferent Types of Font file formats (.otf, .ttf, .woff, etc)\n(~$9000 Total) Calligraphy for Type Design\nHow to Utilize Writing Tools\nCarolingian Calligraphy\nExperimenting with Writing Tools to Create Your Own Alphabet\n About Your Instructor  \nYour instructor Lynne Yun\nHi! I'm Lynne Yun, a New York City based type designer and educator who specializes in typography, hand lettering, and calligraphy. I am proud to be teaching at educational institutions such as Type@Cooper, Parsons School of Design, and the Letterform Archive. I'm currently a board member of AIGA NY and was previously a full time type designer at Monotype, where I created custom typefaces for clients along with a number of retail typefaces, including the Trade Gothic Display and Inline families. \nPrior to that, I was a graphic designer at Apple Inc. in Cupertino, Deutsch NY in NYC, and served on the board of Society of Scribes, a non-profit organization dedicated to calligraphy. My academic background includes a BFA from the School of Visual Arts for Graphic Design and a postgraduate certificate in typeface design from the Type@Cooper Extended Program. Other recent endeavors include a residency at the School for Poetic Computation, and working on a masters degree at ITP in New York University. I'm honored to say that my work has been recognized by organizations such as AIGA, Type Directors Club and Art Directors Club, notably the Ascenders award which honors designers under the age of 35 who show remarkable achievement in typography, type design, and lettering.\nReward Details \nI \u2764\ufe0fLetters Sticker Pack  \nI \u2764\ufe0f Letters Sticker (work-in-progress)\n(There will be at least two stickers.

There are no geographical limitations unlike a physical classroom, and students can study at the pace and time of their choosing. Especially in the world of Type Design, there has been a lack of quality courses on the internet, and in-person classes have been rare except for a handful of cities in the world. An online course will not replace a full Master's program any time soon, but for those that have limited access, need a refresher, or are just starting out, an online course might be what they need.\nClosed Captions and Subtitles\nThis course will aim to increase inclusivity and accessibility by providing English and Spanish closed captions.\nBIPOC Scholarship\nI am providing free class registration for anyone who identifies as BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color). Please feel free to share this submission form. Just as a reminder, the class series is recorded and so anyone who enrolls can take the class at their own pace.\nHow & When Will I Be Able to See the Series?\nFor any Kickstarter backers with the \u2018Full Digital Access\u2019 reward, there will be an access code emailed out in late June when the first batch of videos are uploaded online. The course will be continuously updated every couple of weeks with new videos, until the series are complete. The target goal for the complete course videos is late August to early September 2020. \n Any Software/System Requirements?\nA Computer with Mac Operating System\n Glyphs App (You will be provided with a free temp license! Details below.)\nAdobe InDesign or similar text layout software\nOfficial Support by Glyphs App\nGlyphs: Font Editing for Everyone\nGlyphs is providing free temp licenses for 'Type Design A\u2013Z\u2019 participants. They are also generously offering discount codes if you\u2019d like to purchase your own unlimited license, which you can opt into when the campaign ends.\nWhy Should I Back this Project Now?\nFirst, you\u2019ll be helping this series come to life! Second, you'll get access to the courses as they get created this summer, and llifetime access to the course afterwards! Third, you\u2019ll be getting a huge discount compared to the retail price when the full series launches. After the recording is complete, the course content will be retailing for more than the Kickstarter backer price.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nA crowd-funding model with a minimum funding goal is a win-win for everyone. As an Instructor, I get to gauge interest for the series while being able to pay for the startup costs (setting up a website, getting recording equipment, footing living expenses, etc.). As students, you\u2019ll get your money back if the series isn't funded.\nMedia Partner: FEMME TYPE\nFEMME TYPE is partnering with us on this project to promote the campaign and project. FEMME TYPE, founded by Amber Weaver, is a platform that celebrates womxn designers in the type industry and community. Check out the FEMME TYPE book if you haven't yet, it's a beautiful book that celebrates women in the type industry.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks of this project are fairly low, since I'm experienced in running semester-long classes and most of the making costs have to do with my own labor.

The bottle and cup are full size (18oz bottle / 12oz cup), double walled, vacuum insulated, stainless steel, leak-proof, and BPA free. With a bottle you'll love, and a cup that's always with you, go zero waste and carry better.\nHitch's patent-pending design makes it easy to carry your bottle and cup together. Simply turn the crossbar on the bottom, and the cup releases from the bottle.  \nWhen we set out to create Hitch, we talked to lots of people who carry reusable water bottles, and most wouldn't carry a reusable cup because it was either too much too carry everything, or too easy to forget at home.  \nSimply making a tiny water bottle and tiny cup wouldn't cut it--people wanted a full size water bottle for all day hydration, a reusable cup large enough for a standard coffee drink with a lid that won't leak, and a way to carry both that was space efficient and easy to hold.  In fact, we wanted it to be so easy, that people could go zero waste.\nSingle-use paper cups and plastic bottles create a lot of waste. With Hitch, we've made the reusable bottle and cup so easy to carry, that you can go zero waste and lighten your load. \nWe're including A FREE Bottle Protector with every Hitch. It's a flexible weatherproof cap that fits on the top or bottom of your bottle.  Protects the cup lid when it's on top, and when your cup is out, use it as a cap to protect the bottom of your bottle. \n\n\n\n\n\nHitch is compact and easy to carry. It fits naturally in your hand where the bottle tapers in, much like a carafe. And at 9.5\" tall, it can easily fit in a tote bag, messenger bag, or a backpack. We also designed the Hitch bottle and cup to fit in most cupholders.  \nHitch's cup is perfect for life on the go. When you're not using it, your cup is protected from the elements inside the bottle. When you're ready, the cup is the right size for coffee shop drinks (12oz), it's vacuum insulated to keep drinks warm, and has a leak proof and easy to drink from slider lid to keep things neat and clean.\nIf you use a paper cup at the coffee shop daily, it takes on average an entire tree worth of paper to make those cups a year. By using Hitch, you save a trees worth of cups annually. We also plant a tree when you pledge for a Hitch. We do it through our partnership with One Tree Planted, whose reforestation projects plant trees that clean our air and water, create habitats for biodiversity, and create jobs for social impact. \nIf you use plastic bottles, much of that plastic isn't recycled but shipped to the developing world, where it ends up in rivers and waterways that flow into the ocean. By using Hitch, you prevent plastic bottles from reaching the ocean. We also prevent 100 plastic bottles from reaching the ocean with every you pledge for a Hitch through our partnership with Plastic Bank. They create impact in areas with high levels of plastic pollution, by supporting people to collect ocean bound plastic and turn it into a currency.\nThe Zero Waste Bundle includes everything you need to be sustainable in how you carry your daily beverages and food. We start off with a Bamboo Lunchbox that's made of bamboo fiber composite and a bamboo lid. It uses a flexible strap to keep the lid securely attached, and store the sustainably made Bamboo Cutlery.  \nLastly, the Bundle includes two flexible silicone straws and a straw cleaner. The straw which is compatible with the Hitch cup lid, can also travel with your Hitch! On the underside of the Bottle Protector accessory (free with every purchase), there's a stash area designed to store your straw in, so a straw is always with you.  \n\nHow to Get Your Hitch:\n 1. Select a Reward Tier Up Top:\nSelect the reward  you would like  on the right side of the page.\n 2. Enter Payment: \nEnter your payment info. You will not be charged until the end of the campaign.\n3. Color & Shipping Information:\nYou'll select your color choice and finalize shipping at the end of the campaign.\n\nHow to Add-On an Extra Cup & Lid:\n 1.  Add $20 to Your Pledge: \nJust select the reward level you want, and at checkout, add $20 to your order to get your extra cup & lid.\n\nWe set out to create the perfect reusable solution to carry your bottle and cup effortlessly. We knew it needed to be a great bottle, that carried its own cup inside, with the ability to carry enough water and coffee for an on-the-go lifestyle. After lots of concepts, prototypes, user testing, and refinement, we created Hitch.  \nAt Remaker Labs, we want to make life easier and more sustainable for everyone who carries food and drinks on the go.  As we look to the future, we're all about transforming our disposable-first culture into one that values sustainable living. In order to do that, we want to create storage solutions that offer a high level of convenience, yet are sustainable made and help people go zero waste. This idea, which we call 'conscious carry', is at the heart of what we do.\n\nSpread The Word \nPress Kit\nShipping Details\nWe are glad to be able to share Hitch with the world, with shipping available to more than 150 countries worldwide. Depending on your country, in some instances you may be responsible for paying duty, taxes or other applicable fees before you can receive your package. These policies are set locally, so please check with the relevant sources where you live for the most accurate information.\nAs part of our commitment to climate positivity, all shipping for Hitch is carbon neutral (certified by our partners at Climate Neutral.)

The design of the product\u2014which is the work of a team of engineers and product designers\u2014reflects close to 20 rounds of prototyping and incorporates feedback from dozens of test users. Our manufacturing partner is deeply experienced and has been working with us for months to refine the product and maximize the manufacturability of the design.\n\nThe biggest risks to our project would be a disruption in the capacity of our manufacturing partner. This would require us to engage with a new manufacturer, a process that could delay delivery of the product by several months. However, we do have a strong roster of potential alternates lined up, should we need to go that route. \n\nWe have a strong network of advisors with experience running successful crowdfunding campaigns and have worked closely with them to put in place systems that will enable us to deliver the outstanding product and superior customer experience that we demand of ourselves.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nHitch is made primarily from stainless steel, which is durable and highly resistant to staining, corrosion and other forms of wear. The non-metal parts of the Hitch are made from a durable and environmentally friendly composite materials that is made up primarily of bamboo, while other food-grade pieces are made from 100% recyclable HDPE durable plastic.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur product is made from 100% recyclable or biodegradable materials, including stainless steel, bamboo composites, and recyclable plastics. Furthermore, we offset our plastic use by removing almost 10 times as much plastic from the waste stream, 1kg of plastic, through our partnership with Plastic Bank. In addition, by embracing reusable cups and bottles over single-use, backers can keep hundreds of non-recyclable paper cups and plastic waste out of landfills.\nSustainable materials\nThe stainless steel that we use is comprised of 70% post-consumer recycled steel, the highest level possible. The composite material that we use is derived primarily from bamboo, a fast growing, renewable resource.\nSustainable Distribution\nWe are certified 100% carbon neutral by Climate Neutral. We offset 100% of our carbon. That means all our shipping is carbon neutral. We're also optimizing shipping routes to reduce emissions derived from shipping and using sustainable and recyclable packaging materials wherever possible, and\nSomething else\nFrom day one, we have been committed to building a company that makes a difference. To begin with, we offset 100% of our carbon footprint, and this commitment is certified by the great folks at Climate Neutral. But we didn't want to stop there.

Oven-safe, non-stick silicone dividers that will streamline your cooking and divide your ingredients, to make one-pan meals and meal prepping a breeze.\nEveryone loves sheet pan cooking, but it\u2019s not always as simple as putting everything in the oven together and coming back to find it has all cooked evenly. Reality is, not everything takes the same amount of time to cook. With Cheat Sheets, you can easily remove ingredients when they're ready and never overcook them again.\nWe get it... If you're new to oven cooking, it can feel like a bit of a science experiment that involves a lot of guesswork. That's why we've tested the most popular everyday ingredients and created an easy timing guide so that you\u2019ll get perfect results every time.\nCheat Sheets are made for meal prep. With our modular dividers, you can cook all of your ingredients with even better organization and control. \nYou can fit up to 6x small portions or 3x large portions on a single sheet pan and with multiple sets, you'll have everything you need to prep for the family or a week's worth of meals.\nWith Cheat Sheets you can easily separate ingredients and flavors without having them mingle. Whether you want to use different marinades, cook savory and sweet dishes at the same time, or simply don\u2019t want your food to touch, Cheat Sheets has you covered.\nSeparation also comes in handy for families with different preferences, allowing you to create different portions for those with special dietary requirements or specific tastes - because not everybody likes pineapple on their pizza.\nAluminum foil and parchment paper are hugely wasteful and non-recyclable. Sheet pans are also notoriously difficult to clean, collecting stains and grime with every meal.\nWith Cheat Sheets you'll never have to scrub another sheet pan again and you'll save tonnes of wasted paper and foil. Cheat Sheets are naturally non-stick so clean-up is a breeze. They're also dishwasher safe!\n\nThe Cheat Sheets dividers are made with a premium, food-grade silicone material resistant to temperatures up to 450 degrees F. The dividers will fit on a standard half sheet pan or perfectly on the Prepd Sheet Pan included with each set.\nThe Prepd Sheet Pan is made from Aluminized Steel and coated with a non-stick PTFE and PFOA free coating.\n\nAround 18 months ago we had an insight...\nOut of all the Prepd Pack owners (now over 100,000 people), those who consistently meal prep all use sheet pans. But sheet pans have never changed since their inception. They are hard to clean, require you to constantly waste parchment paper and aluminum foil and are not designed to best serve how we actually cook, ie, multiple items in the oven at once.\nWe knew there had to be a better way. A solution that is easier to clean and gives ultimate versatility to the sheet pan. Allowing you to easily time each ingredient of the meal. A zero-waste solution removing the need to constantly create non-recyclable waste.\nWe were immediately drawn to silicone as it is completely food safe to high temperatures, naturally non-stick, long-lasting and resistant to bacteria. In our first phase of development, we tried dozens of different types of silicone and different colors to ensure our solution would be stain-resistant and have perfect heat transfer. Then we started our testing and prototyping phase. \nThis is where we started cooking meals in the Cheat Sheets to ensure every dimension was perfect and more importantly, food cooked just as well as on a 'naked' sheet-pan.\nWe then opened our first tooling, received FDA approval and did a wider beta test. The feedback was phenomenal all round.After hitting our Kickstarter funding goal we have kicked off all of our final tooling so that production can begin shortly after the campaign end.\n\"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . . \"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . .

As so many of us worry about the future and yearn to return to the glorious spring unfolding outside our quarantined windows, we're excited to bring you our newest, most enchanted project...\n\nCreated by illustrator Kevin Jay Stanton, this 78-card deck features traditional paintings rooted in classical tarot interpretations that delve into the lore and mythology of the plant kingdom.\nFor over five hundred years, humans have used Tarot cards as a tool for divination and meditation. Their archetypal symbols have mystical, philosophical and psychological implications that allow us to understand our past, our future, and ourselves. But even older than that is the symbolism we've always assigned to the plants that grow around us. Hermetic, alchemical and scientific traditions explore flowers as tools for making meaning, medicine and magic. \nBOTANICA marries the tradition of Tarot to a lexicon far more ancient: the natural vocabulary of life on Earth. \n\nBOTANICA takes all of the major and minor arcana of traditional Tarot and reinvents them in the language of flowers. The Queen of Swords is Red Oleander. The Hermit is a Chinese Lantern. The High Priestess is the Elderflower. The Devil is Nightshade.\n\nThe deck features  the complete set of 78 Tarot cards, illustrated with acrylic and ink paintings. The Major Arcana are defined by single plants and flowers, and the Minor Arcana are plants combined with the objects from their suit, with regalia on the court cards.\nThe cards are 3.25\" x 4.15\", printed on premium heavyweight card stock and emblazoned on the back with gold foil. Each deck will come with a booklet naming the plants and objects on each card, and explaining the symbolic meanings of each card. \nThe set comes in three editions: THE HERBALIST, THE ALCHEMIST, and THE ENCHANTER. The details of each set are listed further down.\nDivination is the process of finding meaning in symbols or patterns, and similarly the act of reading tarot is finding patterns, meaning and visions in the symbols. A larger picture is created when a story is formed from how one card interacts with the next, as a bouquet is created from the harmony between many flowers.\nBOTANICA can be read in many ways, depending on what you\u2019d like to get out of it. To start, you\u2019ll want to familiarize yourself with the deck. Light a candle, play some evocative music, and think about how you respond to the cards you\u2019ve drawn. Without looking at the meanings, what\u2019s the first card that really resonates with you? What plant strikes a chord in you on first sight? \n After you know the deck a bit better, it\u2019s ready for use. Plants have always been a foundational part of how we treat our bodies, and Tarot can be a tool to help sort our thoughts. Consider drawing a card in the morning to guide you throughout the day. Ponder a question and draw three cards to meditate on the foundation of a problem, what it looks like currently, and how to handle it in the future. Or lay out a full ten-card spread and really get to the root of it all. \nHere is a small sampling of the cards included in the deck, with notes from their creator.\n\n\nTHE LOVERS represents emotional decisions and the union between independent and equal partners. I chose peonies because they have flamboyant blooms that are \"perfect flowers\" -- a botanical term for flowers with both reproductive parts --  and for the generosity they exhibit in their symbiotic relationship with ants. I think it\u2019s important for modern decks to capture the essence of The Lovers, and for me it\u2019s about people being their whole selves and sharing that with others, the way peonies share their dew with ants and are protected from predators in turn.\n Like the floating seeds of a dandelion, THE FOOL sets out on their journey full of hope and with the promise of new growth. It\u2019s a common plant, almost ubiquitous, and carries with it a naive quality I find appealing - I love the idea of making a wish by blowing on its seeds.\nTarot is sometimes described as the journey of the Fool through the deck. That\u2019s why I picked a weed that could weather all of that and still come out on the other side with a feeling of charm and whimsy to be the major symbol of Botanica.\nTHE SEVEN OF WANDS is represented by Datura, or Thorn Apple -- a highly poisonous species of flowering shrubs pollinated by bats. I picked it for this card because the Seven of Wands is about being ready for a battle and having the endurance to see it through, and the fruit of datura reputedly have the ability to heal wounds as much as they can cause harm.\nI picked Japanese vajra (a Buddhist ritual object) for the wands because they\u2019re a symbol of enlightenment that embodies the balance between the five poisons to one\u2019s purity and the five wisdoms that help one attain it.\n\nTHE FOUR OF COINS is a card is about being trapped by comfort. Honeysuckle bears flowers with a sweet aroma that wafts through the summer air, attracting all manner of creatures. It can be an extremely invasive species, and in those cases its vines can take over native plants and literally choke them. The Four of Coins is a warning to avoid excess, to take time to smell the flowers.\nThe coin symbol I picked for this card is wampum, a beaded Native American currency, as the Common Honeysuckle is a species native to the eastern coast of North America. The shells of this protocurrency were harvested off the coast and prized as much for their value as decoration. Their beautiful swirls of purple and white were often woven into belts by tribes like the Iroquois.\n Here are the  three editions in which we're publishing BOTANICA.\n\nThe standard BOTANICA deck will include all 78 cards, and a booklet explaining the symbolic meaning of each card and each plant. Each deck comes in a sturdy tuckbox, blocked with gold foil.  Everything you need to read fortunes in the flowers.\n ***SOLD OUT***\nTHE ALCHEMIST is a collectible version of BOTANICA, limited to an edition of two hundred fifty.

Between our various ventures, we have raised nearly a million dollars on Kickstarter, and rewarded backers of every campaign with many beautiful books and other rewards.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money and how much work are required to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job. To be honest, our biggest risk is that in these turbulent times people won't have the funds to spend on art projects like these.\n\nStill, there are more risks and challenges involved in making things with such high production values than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. Problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict. (For instance, despite our considerable epidemiological expertise, we didn't see this global pandemic coming.)

The play follows 20-to-30-something best buds Phoebe and Nina as they navigate hitchhikers, shoplifting, drugs, and a flood of selfies on a cross-country no-boys-allowed adventure through the heart and heartlessness of the USA. \nThe Straights is also a investigation of the role road-trip narratives have traditionally played in building a predominantly straight-white-cis-male American cultural mythology. Utilizing both video and live performance, the play aggressively dismantles traditional American mythology through a narrative framework which centers women, queer folx, non-human persons, and people of color as the primary subjects of the American democratic experiment.   \nThere's more info here: https://www.thestraightstheplay.com\n\nWHY IS THE STRAIGHTS?\nT. Says:\nI began writing this play shortly after Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017. Like probably most people reading this page, I find myself continually disgusted and alienated by Trump's vision of the United States. Attempting to understand how Trump was both an aberration and continuity in the history of American self-image, I started reading tons of \"classic\" American narratives- the ones I was supposed to read in high school English class and never did- attempting to understand how this man and his followers saw America so differently from the way I see it and the way I wish to see it. \nI read On the Road. I read The Grapes of Wrath. I read Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas. I read Democracy in America and Huckleberry Finn and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test and watched Easy Rider and read Lolita and watched that movie where Britney Spears meets her mom and sings \"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\". You probably already surmised that all these narratives are about young straight white twenty-something cis-males finding themselves and the American dream out on the open road (except for the Britney Spears one). I'll be the first to admit, my reading list definitely had some gaps it which were my own fault and the fault of my research; but repeatedly centering these narratives on the same type of person also reflects a massive failure of imagination from these writers. I thought, \"Why do only these men get to go on road-trips and find themselves and live by their own rules and define what America looks and feels like?\"\nThe Straights is my humble attempt to tell a story about this country's identity that centers queer folx, femme people, non-human persons, and people of color, rather than people who look like me. It asks what a truly inclusive democracy might look and functional like. It challenges accepted notions of who fundamental U.S. values of freedom and independence might serve to protect, and what the consequences of such a value system might be. It's a play about how I felt on Inauguration Day 2017 and how I hope we will all feel on Inauguration Day 2021.

Time in uniform plays a major role in shaping our identities, but it can also very easily consume them\ud804\udc4bespecially with how we outwardly display ourselves. This led us to examine what has become a major area of veteran culture and creative output:\nApparel.\nThe clothing we choose to wear has a way of speaking to those around us.\nAre your clothes sending the right message, or are they talking a bit too much?\nThere is no shortage of veteran apparel brands, yet for all their numbers, there is a surprising lack of variance between their designs, style, and the messages they hold. The military identity is pushed blatantly to the forefront, often in a manner that appears purposefully alienating and even belittling to fellow Americans. While intended to celebrate being a veteran, this sort of clothing ironically reinforces many of the negative stigmas and stereotypes that run rampant in our community and public opinion.\nTAB Seal shirt back, gray\nThis American Blood seeks to serve as an alternative to the current veteran lifestyle brand status quo. Many veterans and their supporters enjoy the idea of apparel inspired by patriotism and military culture, but find the available options glaring or distasteful. Our approach is to provide apparel with subtle yet stylish designs centered on a humble sense of pride in country, service, and self.\nWe want to be something more than just a clothing company\ud804\udc4bwe want to be a creative outlet with a cause. Our mission includes providing veteran artists with an opportunity to display their talent and share their own story, with apparel serving as a canvas.\nTAB Seal breakdown\nFor this campaign, there are two products from our catalog that are up for grabs. You may have noticed the shirt in our video is different from the one pictured below. Since we filmed the video, we have altered the designs based off the feedback of our earliest supporters. **The designs pictured below are what you will be receiving**\nThe TAB Seal shirt, gray\nOur Seal design is printed on a high-quality heather gray shirt made with a 60/40 blend of cotton and polyester, combining softness and comfort with the durability to maintain its fit and feel with consistent wear. Offered in sizes from XS-XXL. \nTAB Seal shirt front, gray\nTAB Seal shirt back, gray\nThe TAB Leaf logo snapback trucker hat, with a tri-color pattern \nOur tri-color Oak Leaf snapback trucker hat utilizes 3D puff embroidery instead of a cheaper flat stitching method, enhancing the shape and style of the design.\nTAB tri-color trucker hat\nCommunity is important to us, and we have made it a priority to reflect this in our manufacturing process. All products are printed and embroidered locally by small businesses in the San Diego area. \nWe want to be a company that serves veterans who may feel disconnected from the more mainstream brands. Kickstarter provides an all inclusive platform to introduce ourselves to the world, share our mindset and values, and display what we are creating. With this platform we can gauge interest from our peers and everyday patriotic Americans that support them.\nWith the funds we raise from this initial campaign we will be able to bring the rest of our catalog to life. Our goal is to offer more than just apparel by providing a creative outlet to veterans, and support from people like you will help us get there. \nMany bonds are formed through military service, and that is where the story behind This American Blood begins. The three of us met while serving together in the Marine Corps, and we have remained close friends ever since. Reflecting on our own experiences since hanging up the uniform is what inspired us to look outward at the larger cultural meaning of being a veteran.

I also got to connect with the remarkable and kickass steward of the land, Ellen, and the animals who watch over it.   \nImage of certified organic white sage at Sage Winds Farm by Brie Watson from Hipcamp.com.\n* Certified organic by the USDA and CCOF. \nScreenshot of Sage Winds Farm in the USDA Organic Integrity Database.\n Deeply connecting and building a relationship with the sacred herbs that we source and the land on which they are grown is of the highest importance to me.  \nThis is why I promise to personally visit and work on each farm that we support through our products. With my background in the farmers' market industry and as an urban farmer, combined with my work as an energy healer and shamanic practitioner-in-training, I have a deep understanding of what sustainable agriculture and tending to Mama Earth look like. \nYou can trust that you are always supporting the best and most high-vibrational practices with your purchase. \nBecause we will only source sustainably-harvested and in-season sacred herbs, we consider Aura Wisp to be small batch. This is because we want to only harvest an amount that maintains a respectful relationship with the plant, the land on which its grown, and the hands that tend to them and through which they pass. \nClose your eyes... Take a deep breath... Set your intention... Then light it up! \nEasily maneuver your Aura Wisp by its tail so that the smoke from the sacred herbs can blanket you, your space, or whatever needs energetic cleansing. Take this moment to breathe, to be as present as you can, and to express gratitude for all of the abundance and blessings that are in your life. \nMindfully refill your space with high-vibrational, loving, healing energies that resonate with your Greatest Good and your Highest Self!  \nTo extinguish your Aura Wisp, allow the smudge pod to continue filling your space with smoke until the sacred herbs self-extinguish, or simply stomp out the embers.    \nIn the above video, I demonstrate how I use my Aura Wisp to thoroughly cleanse my chakras from \"any negative energies, energies that are not my own, or energies that do not serve my Greatest Good.\" I try to do this every evening to ensure that I remain as centered and balanced as possible. As an empath, it's super easy for me to take on the energies of situations, places, and others, but this practice has helped me better identify which energies are truly my own. \nHow you specifically choose to practice smudging with your Aura Wisp is lead and developed by your intuition, but this is a great place to start!    \nAura Wisp is made for single-use and is much more compact than a traditional smudge stick, averaging at 2.2\" x 0.5\". Its size makes it convenient to use and take on-the-go. \nSitting in stress, frustration, commotion, sadness, anger, guilt, shame, anxiety, or any other low-vibrational feeling until you get home is incredibly draining on your energy. The convenience of Aura Wisp empowers you to transform your day by cleansing and neutralizing any energies that are not serving your Highest Good sooner rather than later.   \n(Left) Comparison of Aura Wisp with a traditional smudge stick. (Right) Sketch of Aura Wisp.\nAura Wisp's compact size decreases the surface area of the burning sacred herbs, which results in the release of an ideal amount of smoke for personal use. Its size also minimizes the amount of ash and the potential of falling burning pieces while smudging. \nThe sacred herbs inside Aura Wisp burn and smoke with the embers left after blowing out the flame used to ignite the smudge pod. Once the sacred herbs are done burning, the smudge pod typically self-extinguishes in the ash remaining in the pod.\n(Left) Aura Wisp. (Right) The completely compostable remnants of your Aura Wisp after smudging.\nLastly, Aura Wisp is completely compostable, as the entire thing is essentially a leaf! You can add whatever is left of your Aura Wisp to your compost pile or let it free outside with the other leaves once you are done smudging. Be sure to double check that the pod is fully extinguished beforehand!\nMy initial goal for this Kickstarter is $33,333, which will allow for my future team and I to turn 1/4th of our current certified organic white sage harvest into Aura Wisp smudge pods. \n*~ My fully funded minimum goal is $144,444. ~*\nThis will allow my future team and I to process our entire first batch of 111 pounds of sustainably harvested white sage, which has already been cured and is now waiting to be lovingly hand-twisted into smudge pods. \nOur fully funded minimum goal of $144,444 will enable us to handmake and ship 8,111 Aura Wisp tins (a.k.a. 162,220 smudge pods), including vegan hemp wick and eco-friendly shipping materials. \nWith the money raised, I intend to hire at least five certified reiki practitioners or lightworkers for 6 months (with the possibility for extension) to hand-twist each Aura Wisp. Together, we will ensure that there remains a high consciousness around the energy being transferred to you through your smudge pods.\nThe fully funded minimum goal will also allow me to cover the investment that went into making this first batch a reality and will enable me to pay my own living expense while developing the structure and system to fulfill your orders.\nIf we exceed our fully funded minimum goal and can reach $188,888, I intend to hire a Marketing Manager as well as an Accessibility Manager, who will ensure that all of our content across all platforms is appropriately captioned and interpreted as needed. Together, we will create content to share the lessons that we have learned through our experience and understanding of healing in today's reality. \n*~ My dream minimum goal is $255,555. ~* \nThis would greatly empower me to do all of the above and secure a suitable home and work/healing space for us to come together to handcraft each Aura Wisp. \nManifest, manifest, manifest!\nIf you love what we are doing and feel called to support more, please feel free to add to your pledge amount \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\nI also have a background in farmers' markets, food justice, urban farming, public health, and community engagement. \nYou can learn more about me here (website) and here (LinkedIn). \nScreenshot from Oakland Food Policy Council's website.\nCreating a product that allows me to combine my passion for sustainable, local agriculture with my love for the healing arts has truly been a blessing. \nI'm geeking out so hard about this project! \nMy wonderful harvests and I.\nAlso, I regularly work with an intuitive massage therapist and reiki practitioner, a hypnotherapist, an acupuncturist, shamans, and various other healers to constantly help facilitate my own healing so that I may better serve YOU, the world, and my Divine Purpose.\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I deeply appreciate and love you for sharing space, time, and energy with me and my Aura Wisp smudge pods.\nSending you so much love and light!\nCheers,\nAlyssia Michelle Plata \n~~~~~~~~~\nIG: @3lementsforgrowth\nIG: @alyssiaplata", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am still in the process of solidifying the tins.

Twelve hours after the funeral, we delivered our baby into the world with no time for meds or a doctor; We were fired then lost all of our money; Our new baby was hospitalized with pneumonia; We started a business then watched it burn; We faced buried psychological pain from childhood trauma. After all of that, what proved to be one of the hardest trials was the anger, mental anguish, and denial born out of an inability to accept that so many things could go wrong in such a short time.\nSometimes we are planted in unbelievably difficult situations. But rather than run from them \u2014rather than dream that they don\u2019t exist \u2014we should face our own personal storms and find a way to grow because of them. When we started this project we were at rock bottom, so we decided to make our message. \nEveryone goes through hard times. It is our hope that this principle of growing can help you and your children as much as it has helped us and ours.\nIt\u2019s not about where you are planted but how you grow. If you are going through something difficult you can\u2019t change the trial, but you can change what you do about it. Life challenges your resolve; it pushes your limits and it tests your strength. With every action there is an equal and opposite reaction: If you are trying to improve it will hurt \u2014 That is literally the most natural thing that could happen. But you can take it. If you just keep growing, we promise you will come out on top.\nOur message is one we learned at the start of our family\u2019s crazy season of storms. After facing the death of someone\u2019s bright, beautiful light \u2014 the sun set. As the sun rose again, we saw the beginning of life while we welcomed our baby girl into the world whose nickname brought this message all the way home for us: \u201cLIV.\" With life comes pain; with pain comes growth; With growth comes grit; with grit comes results.\nThank you for taking the time to read about our story. We hope you and your little ones find it to be something special.\nLove, \n Us\nWe need your help to bring this book to life. We didn\u2019t publish the traditional way because we wouldn\u2019t have been able do what we felt was right. We know what it\u2019s like when money is so tight that you have to search for all the quarters in your house so you can buy milk for your kids . . . So we know how much of a sacrifice $20 for a children\u2019s book can be \u2014 thank you!\nIf you\u2019re the kind of parent that wants to inspire their kids in an honest way \u2014 to teach them how to accept hard things and to find the path to growth \u2014 then we promise you will love this book.\nWe love collaborating with inspiring people and we are excited to call you our friends.

I am the mother of three wonderful young boys, Barris, Kensington and Zachary. My oldest son Barris was diagnosed with autism at the age of three; Barris is non-verbal and unable to read or write. One afternoon, I was watching my children play with each other and I was simply amazed by how autism isn\u2019t a factor in their interactions with one another. My children simply see Barris for who he is; they don\u2019t see him by his autistic label. \n Our journey as a family inspired me to write my book, The Three Brotherteers. I decided to take a pen to paper and write a vivacious and classic story of three young brothers who go on an adventurous journey, as they race about outside on a chilly autumn evening, where the family dog and the frisky squirrels are transformed into characters within their topsy-turvy escapades. Autism doesn\u2019t play a role in the storyline; it\u2019s about the character\u2019s natural ability to engage in social acceptance. \nIn today\u2019s technology-driven culture, computers, tablets and smartphones often replace the good \u2018ol days of hide and seek, climbing trees and playing a game of tag. Disconnecting from everyday technology and encouraging my children to engage with their imagination has helped them embrace their brother Barris, regardless of his autism. The story of The Three Brotherteers brings to life children\u2019s ability to use their imagination, create their own stories and relate with one another. \nI decided to launch this Kickstarter to share The Three Brotherteers with all of you. With your support, I\u2019ll be able to self-publish my book. For every $20 pledge, you\u2019ll receive an advance copy of The Three Brotherteers before it\u2019s released to the general public in January 2018. For every $35 pledge, you\u2019ll receive an advance copy of my book plus special edition posters of The Three Brotherteers characters included. \nThis book is my opportunity to communicate with others about autism and share the positive experiences that can be created for children, especially those who are autistic. I want my readers to learn that children with autism are capable of meaningful communication. Others must learn to believe that they are capable of living a fulfilling life through various activities like play therapy. \nI hope you\u2019re inspired to help me in two ways: one, please share this Kickstarter with your friends on social media, including: Facebook, Instagram, or even an email. A share is priceless to the success of this campaign. And two, please make a pledge of $20 or $35 and you\u2019ll get an advance copy of The Three Brotherteers, or even a small contribution will help us raise awareness. \n A portion of proceeds from my book sales will benefit Good Dog!

With Public Goods, you'll get everything you need for your home and bathroom, with zero markup.\nOur mission is simple: make healthy products affordable to everyone. We were tired of the feeling at the checkout counter and the tacky bottles at drugstores, many filled with harmful chemicals. So we started our own company, launched our brand, and decided to do things differently.\nHow? We sell all our products to you, with zero profit! Imagine that. We only charge a small monthly membership fee.\nThe result is that we can deliver premium products at literally half the price of everyone else, saving you potentially thousands of dollars per year. And on Kickstarter only, we're offering a lifetime membership for a single, one time fee. Once you become a member, you can choose which items you want from our line of natural products and get them at cost.\nSavings aside, what matters most are the quality of our products. We began with obsessive formulations, vetted by the most discerning people we know. It took us over a year. We visited over 100 skincare labs. We consulted with experts. Hired the most reputable chemists. And we think you will really like the result: healthy products, naturally scented, cleanly designed and packaged.\nIn our line of premium natural products you\u2019ll find: \nshampoo \nhand soap\nbar soap\nconditioner\nmoisturizer\nbody wash\nshaving cream\nrazors\ndeodorant\ntoothpaste\ntoothbrushes\ntoilet paper\nlip balm\nsunscreen\nAnd we're going to be launching new products every month - from natural home cleaners to biodegradable garbage bags. All our products are healthy, cruelty free, and contain natural fragrance only.\nAnd, we're not stopping with products for the bathroom - we've already developed home cleaners. Later this year we're launching linens. Next year, groceries - all premium, and all at a fraction of the price of everyone else.\nAnd just like we want our products to be kind to you, we also want them to be kind to the environment. We use bioplastics in our packaging, and are always striving to be more eco-friendly. By keeping things local and making our products here in the U.S, we're also keeping our carbon footprint down.\nAs a thank you to our early supporters, we're offering you an amazing deal. This campaign will be the only time you'll be able to get a lifetime membership. Anyone who joins after the campaign, will choose from a monthly or annual fee. Here's an example of savings.\nOur company was co-founded by Morgan Hirsh and Michael Ferchak. And, our lead product advisor is Kim Greenfeld of Trader Joe's and Wholefoods.\nMorgan studied philosophy at Concordia. Before Public Goods he ran one of the largest luxury leather goods manufacturers in North America, developing and producing products for top brands such as Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Barney's. With an eye for fashion and a nose for quality, Morgan is an expert product developer, while still being grounded in the nitty gritty of manufacturing. Morgan is an avid tennis player and an amateur magician.\nMichael, our COO, studied engineering and Chinese at Dartmouth. Living abroad for over a decade, he became a specialist in product packaging. From sourcing to manufacturing to product testing, he built a wholesale packaging company from scratch that now makes millions in sales. He doesn't like when things don't work, so fixes them obsessively. His college friends remember when he rebuilt a car after it had been through an electrical fire\u2026 nobody thought he could do it. He did it.\nKim Greenfeld is a dedicated foodie, and the founder of Campo Verde Solutions, a consulting firm specialising in the organic and natural food industry. Kim has spent over 20 years at retail companies such as Trader Joe's and Whole Foods Markets, and her resume is pretty impressive: when working as the Coordinator of Buying at Trader Joe's, she opened Trader Joe's East sourcing all perishable items from local East Coast vendors. And when she was at Whole Foods she introduced nearly 1000 items in a four- year period, helping Whole Foods expand and build its natural and organic private label.\nWith their extensive experience in producing premium goods, both Morgan and Michael grasped the inherent inefficiencies in the traditional supply chain. So, with the help of Kim's industry knowledge, they decided to fix it.\nSo join us today \u2013 become a member of Public Goods, and enjoy the best natural products out there at the best possible cost.

After 6 years of teaching art at the university level and making pots on evenings and weekends, I was so excited for the opportunity to work in the studio full-time. I love to work with my hands and create accessibly-priced pieces of art that make people happy. The response to this line of ceramics has been remarkable, and I can't wait to see where the business will go next.  \nKrista (my wife) and I taking a break outside of our current studio in Port Richmond\n My Challenge:\nAfter almost one year of operating out of a studio in the Port Richmond neighborhood in Philadelphia, we have outgrown the space and are now facing an important challenge. In order to take the next step in our business, we need to upgrade to a larger and better-equipped facility that will help us increase production and allow for better visibility and engagement with the public. We recently found an amazing space at the Globe Dye Works, a beautiful converted factory building located in the Frankford neighborhood. This space offers some significant upgrades from my current studio including brand a new electrical system, HVAC, windows + skylights. Most importantly, the Globe Dye Works building is home for many creative small-businesses which provides a great sense of community and potential for networking.\nNew studio space under construction at Globe Dye Works\nMy Goal:\nIn order to move in to a new space and start producing right away, I need to buy a few pieces of new equipment and build some new studio furniture. The most important investment is 3 new electric kilns, which are essential in the production of ceramics.  I am looking to purchase 3 Skutt KM-1227 kilns from The Ceramic Shop, a Philadelphia-based ceramic supply company. Each of these kilns costs $2,844.00 and should last for at least 10-15 years of regular firing. In addition to the kilns, I am seeking $1,500 for materials to build tables, carts, a storage system, and a structure for displaying finished work.  Lastly, I would like to hire and train local artists through an assistantship and internship program, offering them fair wages for their work, which I would be able to get off the ground with an additional $5,000 of contributions. With these updated kilns, improved efficiency, and trained assistants, I will be able to increase production volume and start accepting larger orders.\nSkutt KM-1227 electric kiln\n Your Rewards:\n      #1.  $10 - \nEnamel Pin\n\nEnamel pins are available in 2 different shapes, 4 colorways.\n  #2.  $25 - Small Drippy Pot\nSmall drippy pot is approx. 3\" x 3\" and available in a variety of colorways (Lavender/Grape shown here)\n#3.  $35 - Small Drippy Pot + Enamel Pin\nA small pot from Reward # 2 + a pin from Reward #1\n#4.  $40 - Medium Drippy Pot\nMedium drippy pot is approx. 3.5\" x 4.5\" and available in a variety of colorways (Ruin shown here)\n#5.  $45 - Custom Monogram Planter\n3.5\" x 4.5\" non-drippy planter, monogrammed with your initials in the color of your choice\n  #6. $50 - Medium FX Drippy Pot\nShown here in the Cookie / Cream colorway\n  #7.  $55 - Locals only - Drippy Pot + Studio Visit\nCome by the studio to say hello and pick up a drippy pot of your choice (no shipping cost)!

We love creating purposeful everyday carry items that are built for life, change the rules, and challenge the industry expectations for the better.\nThe Ti Pocket Pro is the only pen that can seamlessly telescope to accommodate 80+ different refills without any guesswork, gaps, hacks, modifications, spacers, or tip-wiggle. It's seemingly effortless ability to transform in length to perfectly fit both parker-style ballpoint refills and standard rollerball refills without any visible gaps or hacks makes it a pen without peers.\nTi Pocket Pro automatically adjusts to 80+ refills without visual body gaps or tip wiggle...it's almost magic.\nThe same pen seamlessly transforms to accept both parker-style ballpoints & rollerball refills.\n\nWhat's All The Fuss About Multiple Refills? \nThe short version:\nA refill is the heart of the pen and most impressions of a good/bad pen is largely due to the quality ink and refill inside. So, being able to effortlessly swap out refills at will, (or when one manufacture goes out of business) allows you to control how your pen writes, and keep your pen alive for generations.\nThe long version:\nWe find that the majority of people typically like (or dislike) a pen based on a refill related preference. After all, the refill ink and tip design is what largely contributes to the dry time, line consistency, and how/if the ink will even stick to certain paper types.\n\nThe majority of mass-market pens (regardless of price) will lock you into buy their proprietary refill, forcing you to buy a new pen if you want to use another brand or refill inside.\nSo, being able to swap out 80+ popular refills without any headache, spacers, or hacks allows you to keep a grade 5 titanium pen body for a lifetime. You can literately pass down a functional piece of family history to future generations that helped record yours.\nCompact EDC Pocket Pen - Grade 5 Titanium Construction\nThe Perfect Fit...Every Time. \nOur patent pending design allows the Ti Pocket Pro to perfectly adjust to the size of the refill with ease without any visual gaps, making over 80+ refills look and feel like they were each custom made for the pen.\nFinally, a pen that works seamlessly with both ballpoint and rollerball refills.\n\nAuto-Adjusting Collet \nRefill tip diameters vary from one manufacture to the next. So, if you want a versatile machined pen that can accept multiple refill brands, you're typically stuck with an oversized pen tip opening and a refill that wiggles/jiggles/rattles around while writing. It can be pretty annoying and noisy in quiet environments. \nOur patent pending design implements an auto-adjusting collet at the front of the pen tip to minimize any gaps and variances that cause the tip to wiggle. The end result is a snug fitting pen tip that feel like it was custom made for the tip.\nAutomatically adjusts to your refill, everytime.\nAuto-adjusting collet helps eliminate \"tip-wiggle\" on various refill diameters.\nDeep Carry Titanium Pocket Clip \nThe sturdy, deep-carry pocket clips are made from solid grade 4 titanium to supply the proper tension and allow the pen to stay firmly in place. We designed these pens for the long-haul, so our pocket clips can be easily repaired/reshaped using a common flat head screwdriver if you ever accidentally snag or bend it. Easy-breezy.\nDeep Carry Titanium Pocket Clip\nCompact Size + Comfortable Grip\nVisual comparison with a ballpoint refill (left) and a rollerball refill (right).\nEven at it's longest, the pen is shorter than a permanent marker and G2.

We are back again, now with an even more minimal design, inspired by the iconic 40 S&W round. \nIntroducing BULLET 02: World's Smallest LED Flashlight, Even Smaller.\n  We wanted to create something better and solve all the issues that the first Bullet faced. So we went back to the drawing board and started a complete redesign. \nThe uber minimal design makes it even smaller than it's counterpart. BULLET 02 can be attached to virtually anything. Your gym bag, your jacket, your keys. Suitable for any indoor or outdoor situation.\n    We believe that your everyday carry essentials are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET 02 not only is functional, beautiful and minimal, but its new design makes it the best, most resistant everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available.\nBULLET 02 will feature a quick 180 degree rotation that is spring locked for secure on/off operation. The Bullet 02 will not unlatch even under the most vigorous conditions. \n  Pushing the boundaries was our goal- How can we make BULLET better? Waterproof. More minimal. More secure. Smaller. Brighter. And most important of all, indestructible.\nAvailable in Matte Gunmetal\n  Matte Black and Matte Brass\n      We designed Bullet 02 with resistance in mind. We wanted to create a flashlight so durable, it will last in any condition and under any circumstances. We even ran over it with an SUV.\n  Designed with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized treatment, BULLET 02 is built for any situation possible. \nRain, sleet, hail, snow, heat and most importantly of all, water. Meaning BULLET 02 can be submerged underwater for a total of 5 minutes without any water breaching it's seals. It will illuminate in any weather and in any situation, helping you solve any problem.\nOur first design wasn't enough. We came up with an even smaller design, added a spring lock mechanism to increase pressure inside of the casing. We also added a longer stem with fine threading to avoid BULLET 02 from unlatching. We combined that with premium aircraft grade aluminum alloy for a refined finish. \nMeasuring in at an incredible 10mm x 26mm and weighing only 5 grams, BULLET 02 is the perfect sized flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 20 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. \nWhat makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.\nOur competition isn't too competitive now, is it?\n   One of the main features we wanted to redesign was our previous \"Twist Operation\". We have improved this by creating a new mechanism altogether. This time, improving the threading by making it finer and having the threading extend all the way up through the inner casing. In addition, adding a gold plated spring inside for optimal conductivity and pressure, for keeping Bullet 02 snug and sturdy at all times. \nPLAY\n\nWe wanted to keep the minimal design without unnecessary buttons to keep it slick. With the new spring lock operation, it won't ever open unintentionally.\nAn LED light is ideal for everyday use over a long period of time. Never worry about breaking the light, since no glass or filament is used, or replacing it, since LEDs can last a lifetime. These batteries also last much longer with LED light, saving you both time and money in the long haul.\nWhat is an LED you ask? LED\u2019s are the most efficient kind of light bulbs out on the market today. One small bulb can last you anywhere from 20,000 to 100,000 hours. Of course you'll still have to replace the batteries periodically. However, we decided to use a premium bulb for BULLET 02 that can last up to 150,000 hours in lifespan.\n  This time we made the threads tighter, finer, and added a rubber O-ring inside the casing to create a more secure and waterproof flashlight. Also, the leverage provided by the key ring makes it easy to twist on/off. Furthermore, the triangle ring offers increased stability when on a keychain.\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: 5 Grams\nWidth: 10.5 mm\nLength: 26 mm\nMaterials: Premium Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy (T6061)\nBattery: LR41 Button Cell\nType of bulb: LED 5mm\nSpecial Features: Premium On/Off twist setting, and Mini Key Ring attached.\nColor Options: Brass and Black\n  SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. BULLET 02's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.\nHi-Res Gallery: Here\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf BULLET 02 is successfully funded, we will make sure everything goes according to plan to meet the promised deadline.

Every time we do laundry, our clothes shed tiny microfibers (including plastic), which go down the drains of our washing machines, through wastewater treatment facilities and into our waterways.\nEveryone who wears and washes clothes is part of this pollution. Everyone who eats or breathes could suffer the consequences. Learn more about the problem of microfiber pollution here. \nThis is a 120x magnified image of clothing microfibers filtered from washing machine effluent. One study found that a single fleece jacket could shed as many as 250,000 individual fibers per wash.\nOur team learned about the microfiber problem while working on marine debris along the US East Coast. It became clear very quickly that this could be the biggest pollution problem facing our ocean. We knew we needed a solution, and the ocean itself helped us come up with one.\nDesign Inspired by Nature\nMost washing machines do not have filters. The ones that do are only good to keep keys and coins from clogging your pipes. A standard filter cannot do what needs to be done: catch fibers too small for the human eye to see AND allow water flow.\nSo, we turned to nature. Coral does exactly what we need; it catches tiny things from flowing water.\nYou just drop, or throw it into your washing machine (any washing machine - front or top loaders, with and without center spindles) and do your wash as usual. It is easy to use and easy to clean.\nCora swooshes around in the laundry and just like coral, allows water to flow, while picking up those little pieces of microfiber and catching them in her stalks.\nWhen you take it out of the washer or dryer, have a look. When you see clumps of fuzz, just pull them out and put them in the trash bin along with your dryer lint. \nThis is the fuzz recovered from one load of doggie towels and blankets.\nThe Cora Ball was designed as an equal opportunity fiber catcher, helping you protect our public waterways from a host of potentially harmful materials and chemicals. In the US, our clothes are 60% plastic. The rest may be made from natural materials, but they are often covered in dyes, heavy metals and other chemicals. So, it makes sense to catch all of this manmade material before it ends up throughout the marine ecosystem, in the bellies of fish, and ultimately, on our plates.\nWe are working hard to find opportunities to upcycle or recycle the fuzz from your Cora Ball, the primary obstacle being the mixed-material nature of laundry lint (polyesters, nylons, polypropylene, cotton, wool, etc.). For now the trash is much better than the nearest river, lake or bay.\nThe Cora Ball will be made from 100% recycled plastic, both post-consumer and from manufacturing (would have gone to landfill). It is 100% recyclable and made in the USA (Vermont). Since we are using 100% recycled material, we have to go with whatever is out there. Most of it will be black, but every now and then, we will find a source for a color. So, the color of your Cora Ball will be a surprise of mostly black with either a clump of color or stripes.\nOur design is getting the attention of industry experts, featured at innovation events and in a variety of media:\nProtecting the Ocean with Each Laundry Load\nThis is about small collective actions having the power to achieve big results. If 10% of US households use a Cora Ball, we can keep the plastic equivalent of over 30 million water bottles from washing into our public waterways every year. That is enough water bottles to reach from New York City to London.\nYour use of a Cora Ball protects both air and water. The Cora ball's design collects microfibers until you remove them and put them in the trash. That means they will not re-attach to clothing and fly off into the air - only to become run-off and end up in our public waterways anyway.\n Cora Ball Backer Rewards\nAs a backer, you will be first to receive your Cora Ball(s) making you an early adopter of this solution to microfiber pollution. And, you\u2019ll get to share with friends, family and neighbors! \nBeyond the Cora, we have some additional rewards exclusive to the Kickstarter Community:\nInvitation to join our Innovation Team: we want this to be the best microfiber catching device it can be, innovation team members will receive insider communications and opportunities to do specific tests and provide feedback to help us strengthen and improve our design. \nJoin us on American Promise: Our work on Rozalia Project's oceanographic research vessel, American Promise, played a vital role in learning about the problem of microfiber pollution and developing a solution. She is a very special boat; a world-record holder and the greenest sailing research vessel in the world. Our top reward levels offer opportunities for a personalized tour, lunch or dinner with the captain, crew and at least one member of the Cora Ball inventor team and, at the $5,000 level, a full weekend as part of the crew working to protect the ocean on the Gulf of Maine. Read more about this extraordinary boat here and watch videos from various expeditions here.\nThe team behind the Cora Ball is all about ocean protection. We\u2019ve been on the case for 7 years and it was during this work that the Cora Ball was born. \nBrooke Winslow, our Technical Designer, at work.\nNot only have we developed a consumer solution to microfiber pollution, but we are working hard to better understand the problem as well. We conducted the first mountains to the sea microfiber study, sampling the entire Hudson River from the Adirondack Mountains to New York Harbor where the river meets the sea (video below) because we know that the better we understand a problem, the stronger our solution.\nPLAY\n\nThis is a true social enterprise: the success of the Cora Ball first and foremost means a cleaner ocean; secondly, proceeds support Rozalia Project\u2019s work cleaning and protecting the ocean and developing and implementing more solutions to the problem of marine debris. Learn more about Rozalia Project.\n The Technology Behind the Cora Ball\nMaterial: Made from 100% recycled and 100% recyclable plastic in the USA.\nRange of use: Useable in your washer and dryer. We've researched the high and low temperature settings in washers and dryers and selected a material that maintains its integrity within these ranges.\nEffectiveness: Catches up to 35% of the microfibers per load, per Cora Ball. The effectiveness depends on several factors including what items are in the load, wash settings and wash frequency. For maximum effectiveness, we recommend using 2-3 Cora Balls. We are constantly testing to learn how it works best and will always share our results.\nLimitations: The Cora Ball was designed to maximize both effectiveness and ease of use. Also, we wanted it to catch fibers from all of your clothes and textiles without having to separate. That said, we recommend that you do separate delicate items especially those with lace, tassels, crocheted sections or frayed threads, and do not wash them with your Cora Ball, as there is a chance they get caught in Cora's stalks.\nMagnified (125x) image of mixed fibers on a Cora Ball after a test load. Without the Cora Ball, these would have washed out the drain, through septic systems or wastewater treatment facilities and into our public waterways.\nYou will make this happen: This Kickstarter Campaign is the last piece of the puzzle, rather than the first. The molds are ordered, the patents filed.\nThis campaign is about production: As a backer, you will support the production of Cora Balls and help us get them to market faster. Getting them to market faster means we start protecting the ocean, its creatures and ultimately all of us, faster. \nWhat surpassing our initial goal means to this project\nThanks to a community of amazing backers and people who will make a small effort for big collective impact, we have far surpassed our initial funding goal. We want to share what that means for the Cora Ball, the ocean and Rozalia Project, and how hitting this campaign way out of the park makes a difference.\n1. It means a bigger impact protecting our ocean, lakes and rivers; the more people who have a Cora Ball, the sooner we start keeping microfiber out of our public waterways. And Kickstarter backers will get their Cora Balls first.\n2. A large community of backers demonstrates support that will allow us to develop stronger relationships with distribution partners who will get the Cora Ball to a broad market.\n3. Our initial $10,000 goal was the minimum it would take to go into production - this was the barest of minimums to make Cora Ball a reality - we would have been assembling them at the kitchen table. Exceeding that goal means a bigger first production run and correspondingly, a more efficient manufacturing and assembly process.\nWe are not going to mess around with stretch goals. We will keep spreading the word about this campaign and encourage participation. We will continue to work on streamlining our packaging and shipping plans. And we will keep in touch with you with updates as we bring the Cora Ball into the world and, together, make a difference.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we foresee has to do with the timing of getting Cora Balls out the door, rather than with making them in the first place. We\u2019ve tried to share a reasonable and achievable timeline for you to expect your rewards. We built in some extra time, but that could change due to unforeseen issues with manufacturing. We will keep in contact with you and share milestones as they happen. if there is a hold-up, we will explain why; if not, come July, we hope to be happily shipping Coras all over the world to get to work protecting our waterways.\n\nAs a team of scientists, educators, ship captains and ocean-lovers, we know that we don\u2019t know everything about bringing a product to market. But, we do know about attention to detail and that not everything happens to plan (especially as sailors and field-scientists dealing with changes in the weather). So, we have added people who do know about manufacturing and products to the team, we\u2019ve paid attention and worked hard to control the control-ables just like we would on our research vessel. And, just like when we are at sea, we will address whatever challenges we face by gathering all available information, assessing the options and making decisions, in this case, with the success of the Cora Ball, our team and our backers in mind.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Support a clean ocean!", "descp": "Thank you for taking action and supporting our work cleaning, educating, innovating and researching for a clean ocean.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["56 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Cora Ball x 1", "descp": "Make an impact at home with one Cora Ball.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5,350 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Cora Ball x 3", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends with a Cora Ball 3 pack.\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 3 Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,848 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Innovation Team Pack: Cora Ball x 5", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends & a few neighbors, with a Cora Ball 5 pack plus limited edition t-shirt (100% organic cotton with nontoxic dyes) and invitation to be part of the Innovation Team.\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 5 Pack\nLimited edition t-shirt\nInnovation team invitation", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["283 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 450 or more", "title": "AmPro Tour Pack: Cora Ball x 10", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends plus a bunch of your neighbors with a Cora Ball 10 pack, a limited edition t-shirt (100% organic cotton with nontoxic dyes), an invitation to be part of the innovation team and a personalized tour of American Promise (with homemade cookies).\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 10 Pack\nLimited edition t-shirt\nInnovation team invitation\nPrivate tour of American Promise (+homemade cookies)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Whole Block+ Pack: Cora Ball x 15", "descp": "Make an impact at home & with your family & friends, and all of your neighbors with a Cora Ball 15 pack, a limited edition t-shirt (100% organic cotton with nontoxic dyes), an invitation to be part of the innovation team and lunch or dinner with the crew on American Promise.\nINCLUDES:\nCora Ball 15 Pack\nLimited edition t-shirt\nInnovation team invitation\nLunch or dinner on American Promise with the captain and crew", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5,000 or more", "title": "Join the team!", "descp": "Join our team on the American Promise.

Back sleeper?...we\u2019ve got you covered.\n        PLAY\n\nMark Webster (Authority Hacker) \n\n          PLAY\n\nTristan King (Blackbelt Commerce) \n  Patent-Pending Modular FreeFit\nExperience the Comfort of a Personalized Fit\nWhat if, instead of losing valuable hours of sleep (not to mention cash) trying dozens of different sleep masks, you got it right the first time?\nYour work would improve, you\u2019d have more energy to go out, and your body would feel stronger.\nManta Sleep Mask\u2019s modular design, with Patent-Pending omniLAT\u2122, offers an unprecedented level of adjustability that\u2019s easy and intuitive to use.\nBecause the fit is tailored to you, there\u2019s no extra pressure on your face.\n  The Modular Eye Contours can be adjusted freely to create a customized fit for 99% of all face shapes - including yours.\n        100% Total Darkness for the Entire 8 Hours\nSleep, Uninterrupted\nWhat if you could sleep through the entire night without waking up even once? Imagine how much better rested you\u2019d feel in the morning.\nThanks to the 100% total blackout of the Manta Sleep Mask, you won\u2019t experience any light leakage, meaning you\u2019ll finally be able to sleep through the night.\nRegardless of your sleep position or the shape of your nose, Manta conforms to your face (and keeps the light out).\n  Side sleeper? Belly sleeper? Back sleeper? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n      The luxurious foam contour snugly conforms to the sides of your face, making sleep on your side & belly more comfortable.\n    There is NO light leakage with Manta.\n  Eye Contours for REM Sleep\nSpend Less Time Sleeping & Feel More Energetic\nRapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is when your brain is repaired and renewed.\nIf you need more energy and want to feel well-rested in the morning, focus on getting more REM sleep.\nDuring REM sleep, your eyes experience rapid movements in random directions. Most sleep masks press against your face and eyes, which can interrupt this process.\nManta has specially designed eye contours that encourage REM sleep.\nBecause there is no direct contact or pressure on your eyelids, your REM cycle won\u2019t be interrupted.\n   Eye contours do not press against your eyelids, which allow REM sleep to occur.\n           Since we designed Manta Sleep Mask for ourselves, we went all out to bring you even more sleep-enhancing features.\n   No more hair-pulling. No more pain. Micro velcro will not stick to your hair.\n    Cotton interior ensures Breathability & Comfort. Manta feels Light & Cool.\n    The 2 sections of the headband are made from elastics, which give you -extra comfort- as the product will STRETCH to fit your head. Limiting the elastics to only these 2 sections prevents the entire band from stretching loose with use.\n    The total length of the product is 71cm, which will fit 99% of all head sizes. The strap is made out of plush cotton velour, so it\u2019s soft & comfortable against your head and ears.\n    Lightweight construction. Manta Sleep Mask is great to use while sitting up straight (such as on a plane).\n    The silicone grip pad on the back of the mask prevents it from slipping off your head during sleep.\n    Manta earplugs are made with memory foam to block out sound.\n    You\u2019re going to love the Manta Pouch. Its separated earplug compartment with a zipped closure ensures you\u2019ll never lose your earplugs again.\n      The mesh design has 2 advantages: \nThe pouch doubles as a laundry mesh net, so you can machine wash your eye mask without damaging it. The mesh net will significantly extend the life of your Manta Mask. \nThe pouch also airs out your Manta Sleep Mask when in storage or during your travels. This improves hygiene and prevents odor buildup.\n  ALL YOU \u2013 YOUR WANDERLUST\nWhat if you could take advantage of everything your travels have to offer, without running out of energy? Imagine how much more epic & memorable your adventures would be.\nTraveling is very disruptive to your sleep quality. Those hours on a plane and adjusting to a new time zone leave you with low energy levels.\nSeasoned travelers know that the trick is to catch sleep whenever and wherever you can - be it on the plane, bus, boat, or just a good old couch.\nUnfortunately, sleeping conditions on the road are often less than ideal.\nThat\u2019s where Manta Sleep Mask comes in.\n           PLAY\n\nMadaline Lorelle (Couple\u2019s Quest)\nALL YOU \u2013 YOUR POWER NAP\nWhat if, instead of getting coffee 3 times a day, you could get a sustained energy boost? You\u2019d feel like a \u201cmillion bucks\u201d before even pitching that major deal.\nTaking a 30-minute power nap is one of the best ways to recharge yourself in the middle of a busy day.\nDespite the short duration, you wake up feeling sharper, stronger, & ready to close the deal.\nThe problem is, your body has trouble napping under fluorescent light found in the office. This is where Manta comes in.\n          PLAY\n\nChris Kim (Hilltop Stores)\nALL YOU \u2013 YOUR ZEN\nWhat if you could escape from a day of lazy lethargy without overdosing on energy drinks? Imagine how present you\u2019d feel.\nMeditation is an exercise for the soul, leading to increased mindfulness and better rest.\nUnfortunately, distractions abound in our daily lives.\nEvery once awhile, it\u2019s important to let go and to try to clear our minds. This is where Manta Sleep Mask comes in.\n         PLAY\n\nJamon Yerger\nALL YOU \u2013 YOUR SLEEP-IN\nIf you only have one day to sleep in, the last thing you want is for the morning sun to wake you up before you\u2019re ready.\nMorning light coming in through the window is a major disruption to your sleep, especially if your body hasn\u2019t had enough time to get fully rested.\nWith our modern lifestyle of going to bed well after sunset, it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, for our body to get enough rest before sunrise.\nAnd let\u2019s face it: we all just want to sleep in every once in awhile.\nThis is where Manta comes in.\n    PLAY\n\nBenjamin Tong (Business Owner)\nALL YOU - YOUR NIGHT SHIFT\nWhat if you could feel rested and have a social life, even while working vampiric hours? Imagine how much healthier you\u2019d be, both emotionally and physically.\nAccording to WebMD, \u201cthere is strong evidence that shift work is related to a number of serious health conditions, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.\u201d\nSleep disturbances and loss only worsen these conditions.\nIt\u2019s extremely important for night shift workers to create total darkness during the day - and curtains alone simply aren\u2019t enough.\nThis is where Manta comes in.\n        PLAY\n\nZak Columber (Gingerbread Marketing)\nALL YOU - YOUR LIFE (UPGRADED)\nWhat if you could maximize your life, without needing to sleep more hours? Imagine how much more productive you\u2019d be.\nWhile it\u2019s ideal to get 8 hours of sleep, let\u2019s get real: with work responsibilities, social obligations, and family gatherings getting in the way, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s happening every night.\nIn these situations, all you can do is to maximize the sleep time that you do have and to upgrade your sleep quality.\nHow rested you feel doesn\u2019t depend on just the duration of your sleep, but also on the quality of it.\nThe faster you can go into, and the longer you can stay in, REM sleep, the less amount of sleep you need.\nManta Sleep Mask upgrades your sleep quality and gets you into REM sleep faster.\n          PLAY\n\n Till Carlos (Maerketing.com)\n  You are young. You are ambitious. You are adventurous. You want to enjoy life to the fullest and experience all that the world has to offer.\nBut you can\u2019t do it unless you\u2019re getting quality sleep in between your adventures.\nYou can only work hard and play hard when you\u2019ve got an abundance of energy and vitality from a good night\u2019s sleep...or a power nap [or two].\nUsing a sleep mask is a great way to improve sleep quality. The problem is, common products on the market take a one-size-fits-all approach.\nYour face and nose shape are unique. Why shouldn\u2019t the sleep mask you use be, too?\nMost eye masks force you to sacrifice fit, comfort, or quality.\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to make sacrifices when it comes to sleep.\nSo, as product designers with over 10 years of experience, who have used dozens of sleep masks in the past 15 years of our lives, we made something better.\n                http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-full-nights-sleep-can-really-pay-offin-salary-and-investments-1411056919\n   \n                  Know someone in your life who would appreciate better sleep?

We're Snoice - and we aim to create an entrepreneurial, cultural, and social space in Southeast San Diego started by, and featuring, local talent.\nSnoice began as a dream of Jayrell and Dianne Ringpis, who grew up in Southeast San Diego. They wanted to provide the Paradise Hills community with its first Asian-inspired dessert cafe. They began by serving traditional Filipino \"halo-halo,\" a refreshing blend of shaved ice and various sweet toppings including ube (taro), egg custard, and toasted rice, as well as shaved snow, a light and fluffy dessert originating in Taiwan. Since then, Snoice has been featured in Zagat (twice, actually!), Eater San Diego, and various blogs. \nCheck out some of our dessert offerings below, and our full menu on our website.\nOn our 1-year anniversary, we hosted a block party called Made in Paradise Hills.\nMade in Paradise Hills was a movement sparked by an event hosted by us in 2016 to spotlight talent from the tiny neighborhood of Paradise Hills (in San Diego, California). The simple goal was to bring together the community that proudly identifies with Paradise Hills for one night. \nSo what exactly happened?\nAbout a dozen of the best artists and entrepreneurs, all of whom grew up in the area, teamed up to give back to the community. Hundreds of attendees celebrated with free entertainment, great food, and tons of giveaways. A whole parking lot proudly made noise and showed unprecedented community spirit. \nCheck out the recap video below: \nPLAY\n\nThe resounding sentiment heard that evening was: \"This is what the community needs.\"\nIn 2017, our next project is to give Snoice\u2019s entire storefront a facelift and upgrade the dining area into a more versatile community space. Our goal is for the revamped Snoice to serve as a cornerstone for the future community. The revamp will allow us to comfortably host meet-ups, student workshops, movie nights, and art/music shows. \nWe recently requested support from the city\u2019s storefront improvement program, which would have granted us up to $16,000! Unfortunately, we were declined because we\u2019re a couple blocks outside of San Diego City limits. Boo!\nThe Snoice storefront.\nSo, we need your help. We want to be able to do more, to provide not only great desserts, but a place where family, friends, and community can gather.\nDouble the capacity of the cafe \nProvide outdoor seating\nBeautify the storefront with a new sign and landscaping\nIncrease wall space inside the cafe to serve as an art gallery \nInstall a digital community board for announcements\nProvide sound system for community events and meetings\nCheck out the renderings here:\nStorefront, updated with new benches, planters, and outside dining area.\nInterior with new lights, decorative planters, to-go window, and a television that will serve as a community board \nView from behind the front counter showing new partition at entrance/exit for utensils, napkins, and trash\nImproved seating arrangement, professional signage, and decorative indoor planters\nCheck out all the rewards offerings we have for each donation level! \n                Keep an eye on our early bird prices (noted in the right column)!

I'm sad this campaign simply didn't work out but I fully intend to rework and relaunch it in 2016. Keep http://www.smarturl.it/worldkickstarter in your Favourites and hopefully next time we'll have more success. You guys remain, as always, awesome and thank you for coming with me on this journey.\nAbout A World of Strange New Things\nIn December 2014, I finished a novel and was burnt out, I wanted to write something different. This isn't new for me, normally between novels is the point where I start new projects, write short stories and detox my brain from whatever world I've been living in for the last couple of months. \nI will just write books by accident, in part because I was diagnosed with bipolar (Type 2) in December and this is the source of my prolific amount of written work. You know what? Writing really helps me.\nI'd been contemplating starting my Contact novel Lesser Evils (narrated by Chaya and Josh) but it wasn't time yet (books have birthdates and times to be written) and so I started going through my existing files and decided to write something which allowed me to do the necessary worldbuilding before focusing directly on Contact but still having it in the background. \nHaving Zoe as a narrator also allows me to look at things Josh and Chaya simply don't have the patience/time (him/her) to deal with in between cracking Standard, the Union's Lingua Franca and keeping their daughter away from the Bureau of Esper Affairs and Registration.\nZoe, on the other hand, she has lots of time and a habit of attracting trouble.\nConcept for the omnibus cover \u00a9 Scarlett Rugers\nA World of Strange New Things is a serial novel set in the Ashteraiverse, it's being split into parts and everyone who backs this campaign will automatically get the first part Sweetness in Sorrow (it was also published as part of my Team Parting anthology reward Beyond the Stars Beneath the Sea). \nI'm in the middle of fulfilling and finishing off my previous two Kickstarters but I like to plan ahead and lay the groundwork (plus I just cannot sit still or make my life easy). \nSerials take a lot of work and this is a pre-order campaign; the money allows me to have the campaign ready for January and will ensure a quick and organised deployment (and a lot less stress).\nThis Kickstarter is for the full novel, split into four parts:\nSweetness in Sorrow (free for every backer/body as a stand-alone ebook. Available when we hit 50%)\nTemporal Grace (ETA: March 2016)\nSuffer the Children (ETA: April 2016)\nGames the Powerful Play (ETA: May 2016)\nPrint versions of each book will follow shortly after the ebook (they take a little bit more work) and send out to backers one at a time (unless you'd rather get them in one go, just let me know).\nI don't think I'm ever going to put these print editions up for sale so this is going to be the only chance you're going to have to get them. I do however intend to release ebook versions next year (because serials are cool) however you guys get to be there, on the ground floor, of my serialised duology.\nThe omnibus edition A World of Strange New Things will be released in print/ebook at some point in 2016. \nIt's important to note the omnibus isn't aimed at you guys, it's aimed at the Amazon market later next year but it makes sense to do one during the course of things. I'm going to offer you the ability to get a copy though, don't worry, but print will be a whole different pledge level, so that only people who actually want one will get one.\nLet's get back to the story, shall we?\nThe Storyline\nWorld is narrated by Zoe, a new member of the Ashterai who is trying to find her place in the universe. She starts off as a healer, a celestial EMT, wandering the universe helping where she can, but soon (after a particularly horrific incident on a Chiitai battlefield) requests reassignment and becomes a personal assistant, herding the Ashterai Elders.\nThis is the story, mainly, of what happens after that when Zoe moves to Seattle, takes on a human form and becomes embroiled in the fallout of Contact, the rise of the Bureau of Esper Affairs and Registration and becomes a secret agent, becoming a teacher for psychics in order to find the soulmate she's lost.\nI\u2019ll publish each one and then do an omnibus at the end and if I do this right, it will bridge the gap between the first and second Chaya and Josh novels, Lesser Evils (set in 2015-2016) and An Inherited State (set in 2018, starting a couple of days post the epilogue of A Star Filled Sea). There will be a companion volume which concludes Zoe's story, When Darkness Eclipses Light which I hope to Kickstart next year.\nIf each segment is around 25k-30k in length, that\u2019s a 115k novel. I know from my own levels that unless I\u2019m manic, it\u2019s really hard to keep my interest on one project for long enough to finish it. I jump from thing to thing and this will allow me to keep writing from Zoe\u2019s perspective but also have another novel under my belt in less than six months.\nAs with the Kickstarter for A Star Filled Sea, this is basically a pre-order program and, if you back all four campaigns, I'll send you a copy of the omnibus edition for free. How does that sound?\nWant to Read It?\nThe Children's Ward\nShellshocked\nWhy am I doing a Kickstarter?\nA part of the reason I like Kickstarter are the people. I'm constantly amazed by the generosity of my tribe (that's you guys, my various teams) and strangers.\nI live on a fixed-income which is rather tiny. I found from my first three Kickstarters that it doesn't matter how well you do the sums to plan things, it never quite goes as it should. However I've now reached the point where I have to keep my life/personal finances far away from my Kickstarter campaigns.\nThe bottom line is I cannot afford to do this unless we fund the campaign so I need your help to make this happen. If this campaign is successful, it means I can get on an finish writing the second half of the duology.\nOne of my favourite parts about Kickstarter is that I love the communal side which comes with crowdfunding. I get to talk to my backers, to take them with me on each roller-coaster ride of a journey, knowing they'll queue up for the next go.\nWe did Changing, we aced Parting and then we had fun with Star. Now it's time to do it again but, this time, for something slightly different.\n A World of Strange New Things is a longer project but I'm really enthusiastic about trying as an experiment in a form of storytelling which will both help my long-term health condition but also allow me to reward you guys with another novel.\nPlus serials are cool. I love them.\nTeam Changing was the reason my first Kickstarter succeeded and I remain indebted to each and every one of the sixty two people who backed me, ditto the eighty two people who backed Parting. I might write the books but I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the support and the faith of the kind people who took a leap of faith on my project. I want you to be a part of their journey, any financial assistance is just a bonus.\nWhat is the money for?\nCovers and the artwork for each part of the serial.\nYou can get a taste of the concepts for each cover below (I love them) but we are looking at five covers here, not one, and that is, in part, why the campaign goal is higher. There's Shutterstock art to pay for, the covers in ebook and print, but, that said, I firmly believe they're worth it:\nPart 1\u2014Sweetness in Sorrow \u00a9 Scarlett Rugers\nPart 2\u2014Temporal Grace \u00a9 Scarlett Rugers\nPart 3\u2014Suffer the Children \u00a9 Scarlett Rugers\nPart 4\u2014Games the Powerful Play \u00a9 Scarlett Rugers\nScarlett Rugers is back to work her magic on the ebook and print covers. She's the uber-talented designer behind the cover for The Whispers of the Desert, the bonus novella I gave away with my first Kickstarter campaign and A Star Filled Sea. I'm hiring her to do the four covers for the serial but also the omnibus edition for consistancy.\nEditing A World of Strange New Things to make it publishable. \nEditors cost money and I want to make sure my books are as close to perfect as I can get them, this means hiring a good and thorough editor. \ne-book and print formatting for the serial and omnibus edition.\nI heard about Polgarus Studio via Hugh Howey (which is like the highest recommendation you can get in the indie publishing world). I hired them to format Whispers, Changing and Parting for me. I never regretted it; it's delegation, Jason Anderson does a wonderful job and I know he will take a lot of the load off me. He will do both the e-book (in .mobi, Smashwords and .epub) of each instalment of A World of Strange New Things as well as the printed layouts for me and it will look amazing.\nObvious, as this is a serial, there will be four different books (each novella sized), as well as the omnibus edition so that's a lot more complex than just one book but I know it's going to be worth it.\nThe costs of the various rewards and shipping\nPrint copies and art cards will all cost money and this is something that final amount has to include. This should also cover mailing out print editions and cards to the lucky people who pledged for them.\nAgain, lots of things to ship and postage always costs more than you suspect it will. I plan to mail out an instalment a month, keeping everyone in print editions soon after the ebook is release.\nIt sounds silly but, as I've learned to my cost in the previous Kickstarters, shipping always ends out costing the most in your budget. Not only do I have to pay to get the books shipped to the UK, I then have to ship them to you guys. It's a depressingly high amount of money and I would really, really like to get it right this time. Or, at least, come close. \nTo give you an idea, in a previous campaign, I spent over \u00a3750 on the purchase of books alone and another \u00a3400 on shipping. You can see why I'm very keen that this be correctly guesstimated. Though lighter, there's a lot of more shipping and a lot more books.\nKickstarter and Amazon's fees. \nKinda obvious but if I reach my goal, Kickstarter get a percentage and so do Amazon for processing the payments. Go figure. \nHere's a basic breakdown of where everything is going in a handy pie chart:\nWho am I?\nI'm a storyteller, I always have been. I started writing at ten, teaching myself to touch type as well as how to use computers. I spent a decade working in journalism, as a blogger and a reviewer before chronic depression, anaemia and a combination of my physical disabilities pushed me into early retirement. \nI even retrained as a teacher but my health issues mean I'm never going to be able to work again, which makes me sad but does nothing to negate the sheer exhaustion of suffering a chronic illness. I found writing to be cathartic, to be the one way I have to stay sane and I'm not going to stop. I wrote a novel, then I wrote short stories and now I'm publishing them.\nI've always been visually impaired and this is no more obvious by the number of blind characters who crop up in my stories. In my case I have retinopathy of prematurity due to being born at twenty four weeks which left me with white matter damage to my brain from too much oxygen, a blind right eye and a blurry left one. I also have Asperger's though that can sometimes be more of a boon than a bane, especially when it comes to research. Three and a half years ago I qualified with my lovely guide dog, Unis, and she serves me very well, allowing me to go out safely as well as keeping me company while I write.\n\u00a9 Richard Steer\nHey look, it's the sequel!\nFor nearly a decade I freelanced for everyone - seriously, the list is as long as my arm - from anime magazines like NEO and Newtype USA to games publications including Kotaku and Official Xbox Magazine to newspapers like the Eastern Daily Press and The Guardian. Now I am recreating myself as an author, specifically focusing on science fiction and urban fantasy.\nI'm in the prime of life, apparently, so being retired as due to my disabilities is incredibly frustrating as I would love to work and put my skill sets to good use.\nIn February 2014 my debut Kickstarter campaign for The Changing of the Sun, the first book in the trilogy, funded at 115% of the goal. In April, I distributed a prequel e-novella called The Whispers in the Desert to my backers. In September, the novel itself found its way into backers' hands and it was a thing of beauty. I ran my second campaign in November 2014 and that also funded (just!) which allowed me cover the costs associated with publishing The Parting of the Waters.\nWe even ended up in our local newspaper.\nEdit: Make that three times.\nWe also went on Radio Norfolk to talk about well ... everything.\nI also went on the RNIB's Insight Radio to discuss being a visually impaired author, Kickstarter and writing.\nNow it's time to do it all again but this time the pressure is off. This Kickstarter is about covering a much smaller cost and offering up a new story for my team, a standalone story that is canon but at the same time my homage to murder mysteries.\nI hope you join me as we venture into A World of Strange New Things.\nClick me", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs someone who has run three successful campaigns, I'm getting the hang of this crowdfunding lark. The success of my first campaign and the existence of print copies can only bode well, my indie toolbox is now a well-oiled machine.\n\nI'm crowdfunding this not just because of the financial side but, rather, because I want to make sure there's a need. By definition, if people pledge, then there are folks who want to read this short novel and so we're all good.\n\nThe manuscript is complete (bar a final pass for Tuckerisation), it's just a matter of handing the file over to be edited and then giving it to Other Jason to do the layout. This is, compared to the other books I've done, a nice project, short and easy with very little for me to do except fire up the toolbox and let them take my manuscript and turn it into a Proper Book\u2122.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Asha Bardon\n5 created \u00b7 53 backed\nI'm a visually-impaired Aspergic author who lives in Norfolk with three cats and a guide dog.

Lang. In this fast-paced yet highly strategic game, 2 to 4 players take control of Viking clans, invading, pillaging and battling in a quest to gain as much glory as possible before Ragnar\u00f6k finally consumes the land!\nHere's a look at everything we've unlocked!\nFrom Guillotine Games, the studio that brought you Zombicide, comes the ultimate Viking saga. The game's striking visuals are a combination of Adrian Smith\u2019s highly evocative artwork, and Mike McVey\u2019s amazingly detailed miniatures. Blood Rage comes with 46 pre-assembled miniatures, including some huge and impressive legendary monsters.\nViking warriors and leaders of the Bear and Raven clans.\nViking warriors and leaders of the Serpent and Wolf clans.\nThe dragon ships of all clans.\nV\u00f6lur Witch and Fire Giant\n Sea Serpent and Troll\n Frost Giant and Valkyrie\nVisit the Blood Rage Facebook page for more pictures, insight, and news on the game!\nIn Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan\u2019s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar\u00f6k has come, and it\u2019s the end of the world! It\u2019s the Vikings\u2019 last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin\u2019s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar\u00f6k, the ultimate inescapable doom.\nMost player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These \u201cGods\u2019 Gifts\u201d grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla.\nMost of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.\nPlayers must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\u2019 strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent\u2019s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!\nGame Components\n46 highly detailed miniatures\n52 colored plastic bases\n99 cards\n4 clan sheets\n36 cardboard tokens\n4 plastic glory markers\n1 game board\n2 support sheets\n1 rulebook\nPledge Level\nYour Ragnarok-level pledge gets you the Blood Rage core game as well as the Kickstarter exclusive Wolfman monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.  \nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $10 to ship in the USA and to Hong Kong, about $15 to Australia, about $15-$25 in the EU and Canada, all the way up to $50 to Singapore and South America,  but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and your carrier choices.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities.

Use the app to guide you back, and you\u2019ll find your wallet, safe and sound.\n3) Stylish\nAvailable in 3 classic designs: the slip, bi-fold and clutch. Each wallet is constructed with 100% vegetable-tanned leather: a rich, full grain leather that establishes a handsome, distinct patina as it ages. \n4) Affordable\nStarting at $49, you\u2019ll receive a sturdy, vegetable-tanned leather wallet with a classic, understated look. More than a durable, visually appealing accessory, it seamlessly integrates innovative sensor technology so that you\u2019ll never lose it again. \nOur Story\nMIJLO arose from a desire to build an essential collection of well-designed goods - a collection established with A Better Backpack and The Everyday Watch. After a pair of successful Kickstarter campaigns, our focus shifted to the most essential of items: The Wallet. \nWhy a Wallet? \nThe wallet is a crucial everyday accessory that carries our most important belongings: ID, health card, credit card, bank card, and cash. If misplaced, the fallout is not just costly, it\u2019s time consuming. \nAfter months of discussion and careful research, our design team settled on two key points: \nEvery wallet should be impossible to lose.\nEvery wallet should be simply designed and easy to use.\nThe result is a well designed wallet that blends understated style with practical, user-friendly technology. \nEasy to Operate, Impossible to Lose\nRewards \nMinimal design and cutting edge technology are a hallmark of all 3 models, including:\nThe Slip: $49 on Kickstarter\nThe Slip features three slim card pockets and a larger slot for cash. Smart, simple and thin, it is made with 100% full grain, vegetable-tanned leather and stitched with high abrasion nylon. Each edge is hand-sealed to prevent excess wear. \nThe Bi-fold: $69 on Kickstarter\nFor those in need of a little more space, the Bi-fold is large enough to carry daily essentials and slim enough to reduce pocket bulk. Made with 100% full grain, vegetable-tanned leather, its natural patina will develop a unique look over time while retaining its original hue. \nThe Clutch: $99 on Kickstarter\nThe Clutch is an understated, versatile piece fit for a variety of occasions. Made with a rich, pebbled leather, each piece features subtle gold accents and is precision-stitched with high abrasion nylon thread. \nMore Colors for All Three Wallets On the Way\nApp Features\nQuick, Effortless Set Up\nDownload your free Where\u2019s Wallet app and activate it in seconds. \nSet Your Notification Range\nAfter you\u2019ve activated the app, set a notification range, and your phone will alert you the moment you step beyond the preset range.\nRetrieve Your Wallet\nNavigate your way back with the distance meter, which tracks your proximity to the wallet. Activate Where\u2019s Wallet\u2019s audio sensor to locate it quickly. \nOut of Range Alert\nThe moment you step out of range, your wallet will beep and trigger a phone alert for swift recovery.  \nLocation Last Seen\nIf you happen to turn off the notification range and your wallet is misplaced, you can view its last known location to retrace your steps. \nWallet Specs\nUpcoming Features\nWe love the current incarnation of Where\u2019s Wallet, but a product that pairs with a mobile app allows us to improve and enhance the original model as we see fit. Here are a handful of potential features we\u2019d like to include in the near future:\nRadar Tracking\nLocate your wallet with increased speed and accuracy. Radar tracking capabilities allow us to enhance a variety of search tools, including an upgraded version of our app\u2019s \u201cLocate\u201d function. \nLocation-Based Smart Settings\nCreate custom notification ranges for home, work, or anywhere you\u2019d like, and our app will automatically adjust the range when you arrive. \nPhone Finder\nIf you\u2019ve lost your phone, activate its ringtone with a quick shake to locate it promptly. \nApple Watch Compatibility\nApple Watch\u2019s wrist tap capabilities are a natural fit for Where\u2019s Wallet. This intuitive technology will tap your wrist the moment you exceed the preset notification barrier, and promptly guide you to the misplaced accessory with directional vibrations. \nWhere\u2019s Wallet? You Tell Us! \nMIJLO has created an interactive game that enables players to track down Where\u2019s Wallet and earn a handful of MIJLO extras. Up to the challenge? Explore the illustrated map to find our wallet and 25 tech icons like Mark Zuckerberg, Myspace Tom, Angry Birds, and Dancing Baby. \nPlay now!\nJoin the MIJLO Collective\nWe believe that interesting, intelligent design stems from the imagination of a like-minded collective.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

I started writing at ten, teaching myself to touch type as well as how to use computers. I spent a decade working in journalism, as a blogger and a reviewer before chronic depression, anaemia and a combination of my physical disabilities pushed me into early retirement. \nI even retrained as a teacher but my health issues mean I'm never going to be able to work again, which makes me sad but does nothing to negate the sheer exhaustion of suffering a chronic illness. I found writing to be cathartic, to be the one way I have to stay sane and I'm not going to stop. I wrote a novel, then I wrote short stories and now I'm publishing them.\nI've always been visually impaired and this is no more obvious by the number of blind characters who crop up in my stories. In my case I have retinopathy of prematurity due to being born at twenty four weeks which left me with white matter damage to my brain from too much oxygen, a blind right eye and a blurry left one. I also have Asperger's though that can sometimes be more of a boon than a bane, especially when it comes to research. Three and a half years ago I qualified with my lovely guide dog, Unis, and she serves me very well, allowing me to go out safely as well as keeping me company while I write.\n\u00a9 Richard Steer\nFor nearly a decade I freelanced for everyone - seriously, the list is as long as my arm - from anime magazines like NEO and Newtype USA to games publications including Kotaku and Official Xbox Magazine to newspapers like the Eastern Daily Press and The Guardian. Now I am recreating myself as an author, specifically focusing on science fiction and urban fantasy.\nI'm in the prime of life, apparently, so being retired as due to my disabilities is incredibly frustrating as I would love to work and put my skill sets to good use.\nIn February 2014 my debut Kickstarter campaign for The Changing of the Sun, the first book in the trilogy, funded at 115% of the goal. In April, I distributed a prequel e-novella called The Whispers in the Desert to my backers. In September, the novel itself found its way into backers' hands and it was a thing of beauty.\nWe even ended up in our local newspaper.\nEdit: Make that three times.\nWe also went on Radio Norfolk to talk about well ... everything.\nI also went on the RNIB's Insight Radio to discuss being a visually impaired author, Kickstarter and writing.\nNow it's time to do it all again. I've spent most of the year getting the first draft of the second novel, The Parting of the Waters, down on paper. I'm really excited about this one as it not only expands on the world I introduced in Changing, but allows me to explore different facets of my alien world from a whole new set of perspectives.\nAbout The Parting of the Waters\nMy magnum opus is the Ashteraiverse, a multi-work tale of the future and the past set on many worlds. The Changing of the Sun trilogy is my opening gambit and now it's time to revisit the sun-battered world of Coronis with the second volume of the trilogy.\nThe covers for the entire trilogy as created by Jason Gurley\nCoronis has changed so much since the Changing of the Sun, a cataclysmic event which saw a solar storm batter the planet and, guided by Saiara, their inexperienced Oracle, the people fled north and were driven underground, surrounded by rock and the protection of the ages.\nMap of Reskha: After the Changing of the Sun (Created by Rob Antonishen of http://www.cartocopia.com)\nTime passed and the people changed and then, just like that, the cataclysm ended and it was time to rebuild.\nEventually, of course, the exiles begin to return home. This is the story of the Reclaiming, when towns were refounded, cities brought back from ruin and fresh sets of eyes looked on the past and saw reason where there had once been blind faith. Now their eyes look not just to the land but to the stars and what might be waiting for them out there.\nAs with The Changing of the Sun, the book is narrated from multiple perspectives from the diver An'she to an alien girl cut off from her home, Maros the inventor and Jannah, the current Oracle. Some of them you've met before in other guises, others you'll be crossing paths with for the first time. Some you might recognise by other names and, like me, greet as you would old friends wearing new, less shabby clothes.\nThis is a story about rediscovery, about Contact and about how high a race can soar if given the room\u2014and the chance\u2014to fly.\nWant to know more?\nYou can check out my Pinterest mood board for the book by clicking here. \nHere's the opening, a sample from the second chapter and another from later in the book.\nThe cover\u2014one of the last Jason Gurley created before his retirement from cover design\u2014is already done:\nJason Gurley did the covers for all three books, one of his last projects before his retirement from cover designing.\n Isn't it gorgeous?\nWhy am I doing a Kickstarter?\nI live on a fixed-income which is rather tiny. I could pay for all these things but it would take fives times as long and I love the communal side which comes with crowd-funding, I get to talk to my backers, to take them with me on each roller-coaster ride of a journey, knowing they'll queue up for the next go.\nYou can see the full breakdown of how much Kickstarting Changing and the prequel novella actually cost me. I've done this to be as open, honest and transparent about the figures as possible.\nTeam Changing was the reason my first Kickstarter succeeded and I remain indebted to each and every one of the sixty two people who backed me. I hope they'll become part of Team Parting too. I might write the books but I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the support and the faith of the kind people who took a leap of faith on my project. I want you to be a part of their journey, any financial assistance is just a bonus.\nWhat is the money for?\nEditing Parting to make it publishable.\nI've been lucky enough to find an editor who loves my work almost as much as I do and also happens to be a perfectionist. I insist on paying Ellen for her time and so the bulk of the Kickstarter is going to cover her fee to turn my pile of muddy rock into a beautiful shards. She's totally worth it.\nIllustrations \nWhile I was doing Changing I came across Ben J. Adams via his illustrations for Hugh Howey's Sand and Michael Bunker's Pennsylvania. I subscribe to the Michael Bunker School of Independent Authorship which mean making the best product you can because that's how much you care about it. As with Changing (which came out of my own pocket and was so worth it, I cried), I envision commissioning Ben to do panels which separate each 'act' of the book. To give you an idea, this beauty is what he created for Changing:\n\u00a9 Ben J. Adams\ne-book and print formatting\nI heard about Polgarus Studio via Hugh and Tim Grahl (which is like the highest recommendation you can get in the indie publishing world). I hired them to format Whispers and Changing for me. I never regretted it; it's delegation, Jason Anderson does a wonderful job and I know he will take a lot of the load of me. He will do both the e-book (in .mobi and .epub) as well as the printed layout for me and it will look amazing.\nAs with Changing, print and ebook copies will be made available first to Team Parting and then to everyone else and I have Parting set for a Summer 2015 general release. \nWanna see how big Parting will be? If it's anything like Changing, it should be pretty big.\nAll my books are 5 by 8, for the sake of scale, Chimes at Midnight is a standard-sized American trade paperback\nThe costs of the various rewards\nPrint copies, posters and art cards will all cost money and this is something that final amount has to include. I under-budgeted massively for this last time around and I'm not going to do that again. Also the print copies are large, bulky and heavy and sending one copy outside of the country cost nearly \u00a310 ... so yeah ... \nKickstarter and Amazon's fees. \nKinda obvious but if I reach my goal, Kickstarter get a percentage and so do Amazon for processing the payments. Go figure. \nHere's a basic breakdown of where everything is going in a handy pie chart:\nRewards\nThis time I'm going to learn from my mistakes. There will be a print version, I'm also making print versions of Whispers and Changing available so that anyone who wants one can catch up. Plus there's a bundle (anyone who orders the Oracles bundle will get the first two books soon after the Kickstarter funds) so people have something to read until Parting comes out. \nThe bonus anthology!\nBecause I'm asking for so much more, I wanted to make this Kickstarter special. I also have spent the last year writing stories set in the Ashteraiverse (the overarching universe in which the Changing trilogy is set) and this is something that is important to me. \nI want to give you, each of you, a bonus anthology for backing me. A novel-length collection of Changing/Ashteraiverse stories called Beyond the Stars Beneath the Sea. \nThis will unlock in print and ebook when we fund at \u00a33000. Everyone who pledges over \u00a315 will get copies sent out (print and/or ebook, subject to the tier levels chosen).\nYes Jason Gurley has done the cover because I asked really nicely and he is awesome. It's one of the concepts from Parting but fits beautifully with the stories I want to tell. \nThe anthology itself probably won't come out until spring but I want to use this opportunity to reward you for your help, faith and financial support, to make backing me about more than just signed books and Team Parting. It will also give you something to read until Parting comes out in the summer.\nI'll tell you more about that during the actual campaign but, for now, check out the glorious e-book cover: \nThe gorgeous cover designed by Jason Gurley!\nIntroducing add-ons! \nAdd-ons are something I've come to appreciate, having backed a number of projects where the basic model was enticing but the option to add extras in just sweetened the deal. \nThese lovely art cards can be yours!\nSo, for example, let's say you really liked the art cards but got Whispers and Changing in the last Kickstarter? You're awesome! However what if you pledged, for example, for the \u00a315 print or ebook edition of Parting but really want the art cards? You can have them! \nPledge what you can, that's the important bit. A couple of quid is better than nothing. Specify a tier if you want to be specific, then just select one of the following:\nAdd in \u00a35 for a copy of all three art cards and tell me you want them when I send out the backer questionnaire at the end of the campaign. \nAdd in \u00a315 for a signed trio of A3 posters showing the covers (plus \u00a35 for shipping). I'll sign them too if you like.\nThe important thing is I want to give you guys as many options when it comes to formats/extras as possible. These are also the nicest and easiest, for me and my flagging energy levels, to get re-printed.\nThen, at the end, when we come to the Backer Surveys, I'm going to need you to tell me what you want and I will thus brave the post office once more to ensure everything gets sent out.\nGuide dog/frame not included!\n Key Dates\n7th October-7th November\nThe campaign! NaNoWriMo! All the things! Once the campaign ends, there is a fourteen day delay before Kickstarter transfers the funds.\n24th November\nI'll order the requested physical copies of Whispers and Changing along with art cards and any posters ordered.\nDecember\nAny print copies will be mailed out along with add-ons like posters/art cards. Hopefully most UK-backers will get their copies in time for Christmas/Yule.\nJanuary\nParting will be finished and handed over to be beta-read with editing to follow at the end of January. \nBeyond the Stars Beneath the Sea will be planned out ready for Ellen to start editing with the new year.\nOctober-February\nI start talking to Ben about art (I will probably do this earlier but some aspects involve the layout being ... well laid out ... first). Not everything in publishing happens neatly one after the other but, instead, sort of at the same time. \nBeyond the Stars Beneath the Sea will go to Ellen to be edited and then to Polgarus who will work their magic.\nJanuary to April\nRewriting, editing and stress. No seriously, it'll be fine. At this point I know what needs doing, when and how much it costs.\nMarch\nBeyond the Stars Beneath the Sea will go out to backers in ebook with print to follow\nApril\nThe manuscript for Parting will go to Polgarus to be turned into ebooks/print/Smashwords. I will try not to panic too much.\nMay\nTeam Parting will get their ebook copies! Wooot! I will then order proofs, print copies and send them out to backers once they come in.\n23rd June 2015\nThe Parting of the Waters is released publically, ditto Beyond the Stars Beneath the Sea, in print and ebook. \nThe Kickstarter campaign starts for The Shadow of the Stars (including the novella One in Green, the Other Blue)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI didn't go into my first Kickstarter blind (pun so intended!) but I did learn shedloads about the processes, about what goes into e-book and print books, about the stress and the hell of will I/won't I. \n\nI really hope this time will be smoother but things will still take longer than I envision they will because, you know, it just has to be like that. I might be able to control my own output but this process involves other people, layout, formatting, illustration and editing, those are my wildcards but each person I've chosen is reliable, is good at their job and it all comes right in the end.\n\nYes, I am asking for more money this time. However my reason for doing so is good: when I first started crowd-funding, I didn't know Michael, I'd only just heard about Ben and I wasn't thinking about doing a print edition, even if I had budgeted to get covers done so I could in future.\n\nI lost money on my last Kickstarter (no matter how well you do your sums, exchange rates are variable, word counts change and extras always seem to cost more). I never expected to make any but I have a better understanding of costing now I've done this once. \n\nI can buy printed books from CreateSpace, for example, but I do get them at cost. That said, shipping remains an evil and callous mistress and the Royal Mail, now a private company, seems to be making the cost of sending anything bigger than a stamp prohibitive.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #152", "update_userinfo": "New Kickstarter Alert", "update_content": "Morning folks, a heads up (and apologies to the returnees who get this three times in variants over different campaigns!)\nI have a new Kickstarter out.

Welcome!\nTerraMare will be a countryside restaurant inside an organic naturally irrigated vineyard that will conduct different sustainable practices during the project. The restaurant will serve fresh produce grown on site and the best quality ingredients from local distributors.

Carry your bags in style!\nWe will be part of a vineyard that harvests the best quality of organic grapes and produces a sulfite-free artisan wine using techniques handed down from past generations.\nThe vineyard does not require irrigation!\nOur restaurant's principles are based on sustainable practices. For instance, the structures of the beautiful buildings are made with adobe bricks that provide a natural vibe to the setting. The water system at the property is spring fed and only relies on wind and gravity to distribute it throughout the location. Food waste from the restaurant will be composted, vegetable oil from the fryer will be turned into biodiesel and a great amount of the electric energy will be supplied by solar panels. The vineyard is naturally irrigated, meaning the only water it receives comes from rain and from subterranean moisture.\nPLAY\n\nWe designed a menu that evolves from the Baja Mediterranean roots. The food we will serve will feature many of the ingredients grown on site, sustainable seafood from the beaches of Ensenada and hormone-free grass fed beef from a ranch in Mexicali. Flavors will revolve around some European influences but will portray a signature regional taste.\nCherry Tomato, Olive and Marinated Eggplant Salad topped with Caramelized Red Onion and Pine Nut saut\u00e9ed in Sauvignon Blanc with Cayenne Breaded Mushrooms\nBalsamic Poached Octopus with an Tomato Jam\nThe Main Area and the back of the Tasting Room\nThe restaurant will have its own Organic Garden where it will grow almost all of the ingredients we will cook with. This piece of property will be organized with raised beds made with adobe bricks and will be irrigated using the spring fed system.\nSpaces will be made available for all types of events. We will cater for weddings, baptisms, company parties or weekend camping retreats for people who visit from all over the world. The property will also serve as a platform for different groups who will visit us to learn or teach about sustainability, agriculture, viticulture and culinary arts.\nThe Dining Room where the shade cloth will be built\nThanks to the large open fields and breathtaking scenery, the restaurant will also serve those who wish to camp at the property's camping section.\nFortunately, we already have designated a space for the kitchen and have decided on the location of an outdoor patio that faces the scenery. There will not be any construction involved in the project. We will only utilize spaces that have already been built to reduce costs in infrastructure.\nThere are three bathrooms ready to serve the restaurant, that rely on water from our spring fed system. These need a quick touch-up but nothing incredibly energy consuming. \nWe look to serve a maximum capacity of 120 people at the restaurant, with a possible higher number (300) for events. Currently, the tourist demand in the region is not being met by other restaurants that are close to us. There is an incredible number of visitors from various places including the United States, Europe and Asia. There are two cruise ships full of people eager to discover the region that dock at Ensenada, which is only 15 minutes away, twice a week. We plan to attract people through the use of web advertising, local word of mouth and by inviting media from all of Baja California and San Diego to dine with us at the restaurant's opening. We also host local dignitaries, business owners, community leaders, celebrities and distinguished guests at the opening for an increased exposure.\nOne of the priorities will be to invite a large number of bloggers, food writers and wine critics to experiences the project first hand and help us by exposing it on the world wide web.\nWe have friends who own restaurants and although we are relatively new to owning one ourselves, we have reached out to some of them in the search of reusable equipment that they are preparing to discard from their establishments in order to install it at our location.\nRestaurant equipment we already have:\n30-40 wooden chairs\n5 wooden silverware and plate stations for the dining room\n3 wooden benches\n2 wooden tables\nA 4-burner range stovetop\nOur Kickstarter budget includes the kitchen equipment needed for a basic restaurant operation, materials for building chairs and tables, and materials for the construction of a shade cover for the outdoor dining room.

The Own Your Awesome Affirmation Deck was designed only using the colors of Red, White, Black and the stunning GOLD foil. \nWhy? Well, because I love these colors.  They make the deck sleek, yet sassy, but these colors can also carry a deeper meaning. \nColors can affect our mood and our emotions, and these four our very powerful. \nRed = Courage, Strength, Passion, Power\nWhite = Balance, Healing,Truth, Inspiration\nBlack = Repels Negativity, Protection, Deep Mediation\nGold = Self-Confidence, Overcoming Bad Habits, Creativity, Luxury\n{Psst. None of these test prints have the gold foil but everything that is yellow will be printed with GOLD foil, including the heart on the top of the box!}\nHow to use the deck:\nThis deck can be used a variety of ways, you could even just use it as a beautiful decoration for your coffee table.  But, of course, I suggest you actually use the cards inside. \nStart your day off inspired! Keep the box next to your bed and let an affirmation be the first thing you see in the morning to get you motivated for your day! \nKeep the deck at your workspace. When you are stressing about an unanswered email, a sudden change to schedule, or feeling stuck pick a card to turn your day around and remind you that everything will work out.\n Whenever you are feeling down, stuck, or uninspired pick a card and go to the nearest mirror. Read your affirmation out loud to yourself. Listen to and believe what you are saying. Own Your Awesome! \nPost the affirmations in places that you will see them: on your mirror, your fridge, your television, your car, your closet, your desk to shift your energy from blah to YES! Life is Good! \nGift them out to others to brighten their days! Leave one with a tip, pack one in a lunch, leave one on a strangers car. Spread the love and inspiration around!\nYou can use the deck like a Magic 8 Ball, asking a question and picking a random card to get exactly what you need.  Or, you can simply search through the deck to find the card that calls fits you and your situation at that particular moment.\nRead it. Say it. Believe it! Own Your Awesome!\nWhats Makes Up The Deck:\n52 - Affirmation Cards Each with their own unique, uplifting affirmation.  No cards have the exact same design and color scheme.  3/4 of them using GOLD foil in their design.  {everything you see in yellow will be GOLD foil}\n1 - Put the Cards to Use Card giving you a few examples on what to do with the deck now that you have it.\n1 - Who is Your Joyologist Card describing who I am and why I was inspired to create this deck.\nAll of the cards share this same back, just like a deck of playing cards would.\nEach card is 4 inches x 4 inches with rounded edges printed on 350 GSM card stock with a smooth finish. \n The 54 cards are packaged perfectly inside a stunning two part box with a GOLD foil heart on the front.  \nEach deck will come cello wrapped to keep it protected, intact, and untouched before you receive it. \nWhy an affirmation deck?\nI have been using affirmations since at least 2008 when I started to create my Joyology.  I had been living out my biggest dream of being a live sound engineer touring around the world with Grammy Award Winning Artists and  I was often the happiest and healthiest person on the road. \nI saw first hand that even these people that we make up \"have it all\", that truly have what we call \"success\" don't wake up everyday stoked to jump out of bed.  Even with thousands of fans screaming their name, they still have rough days.  EVERYONE forgets their greatness.  EVERYONE needs daily inspiration.  \nSo, with the sudden loss of my father in 2008,  I was moved to make a bigger difference in the world.  I dreamed another dream and created a position for myself as a Joyologist supporting artists on the road keeping them inspired, grounded and healthy in body and mind in order to inspire others around the world. \nOne of the things that I did everyday on the road as a Joyologist, was to post an affirmation in the artist's dressing rooms. \nAffirmations are quick, to the point, easily digestible nuggets of wisdom.  All the time our heads are filled with fears, worries, doubts, shame, blame. We think:\nThey aren't going to like it.\nIt's not going to work.\nThey are going to say no.\n I suck. \nI am so lazy.\nThis is so hard!\nAnd on and on and on.  \nBy using affirmations you can shut down all of those negative thoughts that are swirling around in your head. \nOne simple affirmation has the power to turn your day around. \nWhen I originally created my Joyology it was to inspire artists on the road, because that was the world that I knew.  Soon after through the power of social media I began to inspire people internationally.  I launched my website, created services, programs, and a newsletter all to inspire people to live their lives and love their lives.  \nNow with this Own Your Awesome Affirmation Deck (and more merchandise items to come) I will get to inspire even more people internationally.\nAll I really want is for you to love every tiny bit of yourself.  \nI want YOU to Own Your Awesome!  \nYou are uniquely you.  Be who you are.  Love who you are. \nWhere is the money going?\nThis is actually a pretty complicated product to manufacture.  Having 54 cards each with a unique design and the majority of them using gold foil makes the printing process quite involved. \nThis means that in order to have them made I need to order a high quantity, to make the decks more affordable.  Nearly all of the money will go directly to manufacturing and shipping. \nThere are also a few legal and business fees to cover my ass and truly make my new product line business legit!\nAny remaining money will go into investing in purchasing more decks for me to sell to stores, and also to set more inspiring and awesome products into print!\nWhere am I at now?\nI have been working on this project for over 9 months!  I have waited to launch this Kickstarter until every tiny detail was worked out.  All designs, every word, paper stocks, sizes, researching manufacturers, everything in this deck have been fine tuned!  \nI have designed  the Own Your Awesome Affirmation Deck and set everything up to make them store ready!  To make them ready to go into inventory I have purchased a barcode and ISBN number and incorporated them into the design of the box.  This way as soon as this Kickstarter Project is funded these decks will be ready to be carried everywhere from your local cute gift shop, your fun boutiques, local book stores, yoga studios and also big name chains like Anthroplology and Urban Outfitters.  \nI am working with a manufacturer that is reputable and solid.  I am completely confident in using them to produce the Own Your Awesome Affirmation Deck.  I have been in communication with them for 7 months.  They are a company that specifically prints decks of cards (playing cards, tarot cards, flash cards, etc). I have talked with people who have printed decks with them and recommend them highly. \nThey have sent me samples of everything that I want to do with this deck and my proofs have been approved to go to print in mass!   I am right now awaiting the final, final, final prototype which will be in my hands before this campaign has ended.\nAs soon as this campaign is funded the decks will go to print!\nAll of the affirmations in the Own Your Awesome Deck were written by Tricia Huffman.\n\u00a9 2014 Your Joyologist Own Your Awesome is a trademark owned by Your Joyologist\u2122  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I am confident in my manufacturer, I understand that things may get delayed in the manufacturing and shipping process.

This film has long been gestating in my mind and heart for many years and it wasn't until November 2012 that I finally began preparations to begin work on it. Since then I have finished the script; found my actors and begun rehearsals; scouted locations to film; and am now in the final stretches of pre-production. My main hope is to finish this film with as much love and care as it deserves, and because of this I am asking for help to do exactly that. The Kickstarter community has been amazing at helping creators reach their goals and hopefully you guys can help one more reach theirs.\n- Writer/Director Sergio Lopez \nWhat is the movie about?\nWeigh Down is a drama that centers on an aging musician that tries to reconnect with his son and his music. As he begins this journey, his past is brought back to the forefront of his life and he must now learn to cope with the things he\u2019s done and find redemption. This film encompasses realism found in drama as well as takes inspiration from musical films such as Once. In the end Weigh Down will be a film that uses music as a device to allow the characters the ability to explore their emotions and move forward in this dramatic setting.\nOfficial Synopsis:\nCarlo Mays, an aging blues musician, has been gone from home for 10 years. During those years he has been running away from his past and drowning in the sorrows he can't seem to escape. When he finally arrives back in San Diego, Carlo tries to find what pieces of his old life still remain and most importantly his son. It isn't until he meets Jenna Young that he begins to realize there may be hope left for him and that maybe he can find redemption for the sins of his past.\nWhat are our goals?\nThe goal of this project is to submit the film to high profile film festivals such as Sundance, Tribecca, and SXSW. Though Weigh Down is a micro-budget film that is being supported by the filmmakers themselves, we know that with your help we can make this film so much more than it can be by ourselves.\nWhat you will be helping us with.\nWith all of your help we plan to use the donations towards submitting to film festivals, audio mixing, color correction, wardrobe, and rentals for equipment we will need through out the filming (extra lighting equipment, extra battery packs, special lenses, etc).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike with any production some complications can arise.

Since then, I\u2019ve been embarking on an epic adventure: Project 562.\nFor the past year I have been fulfilling the project\u2019s goal of photographing citizens of each federally recognized tribe in the United States (there are now 566). Most of the time, I\u2019ve been invited to geographically remote reservations to take portraits and hear stories from a myriad of tribes, while at other times I've photographed members of the 70 percent of Native Americans living in urban settings. My hope, is that when the project is complete, it will serve to educate the nation and shift the collective consciousness toward recognizing our own indigenous communities.\nImagine walking through an exhibit and realizing the complex variety of contemporary Native America. Imagine experiencing a website or book, that offered insight into every Tribal Nation in the United States. What if you could download previously untold histories and stories from Apaches, Swinomish, Hualapai, Northern Cheyenne, Tlingit, Pomo, Lumbee, and other first peoples? What if you had heard those stories in grade school? \nProject 562 is making all this happen.\nWith Your Support \nThis is Project 562's second Kickstarter campaign for critical funding for our second year on the road. Your help covering the ongoing expenses for transportation, film, administration, lodging, and meals will keep Project 562 strong and on target.\nRewards\nWe are delighted to offer wonderful \"reward\" items for this year's Kickstarter. We've partnered with noted Native American fashion designer and artist Bethany Yellowtail for limited edition couture pieces along with original sweatshirts, spirit tees, sweater dresses, and Project 562 posters.We hope you\u2019ll be as pleased as we are with these unique, attractive acknowledgements of your support.\nProject 562 Poster\nOfficial 11x14 Project 562 Poster, featuring Darkfeather, Eckos and Bibiana Ancetta from the Tulalip Tribe.\nOfficial Team Spirit Tee of Project 562\nThe Spirit Tee's offer original Project 562 photographs and are available in size s-xl.

Yellowtail for Project 562\nPLAY\n\nBethany Yellowtail, fashion designer, stylist, and motivational speaker from the Crow and Northern Cheyenne Tribe has partnered with us to assist in fundraising efforts for Project 562.  In this very exciting collaboration, Yellowtail has transformed Project 562 photography into one-of-a-kind textile prints. She has created three, limited edition couture pieces that will serve as gifts to the generous contributors of Project562:\nYellowtail Shift Dress\nThis original photographic silky textile by Matika Wilbur has been transformed by B.Yellowtail into a luxurious, dainty shift dress.

This elegant, hand beaded dress, showcases Quinalt women dancing on the shores of the Olympic Coast in Washington State, welcoming Canoe\u2019s from several Tribal Nations. Available in xs-xxl.\n Original image:\nWhy Project 562\nProject 562 creatively addresses and remedies historical inaccuracies, stereotypical representations, and the absence of Native American images and voices in mass media and the national consciousness.  I believe that there is an open space that is yet to be filled- that space is authentic images and stories from within Native America. My work aims to humanize, the otherwise \u201cvanishing race\u201d, and share the stories that our people would like told. In this respectful way, I have been welcomed into hundreds of tribal communities, and I have found that people welcome Project 562, because they are ready to see things change. Conversations about tribal sovereignty, self-determination, wellness, recovery from historical trauma, and revitalization of culture will accompany the photos in captions, video, and audio recordings. \nThe time of sharing, building cultural bridges, abolishing racism and honoring the legacy that this country is built on is among us. Project 562 is that platform.\nMatika Discusses Project 562 at TED\n Watch Our Road Stories\nProject 562 in The Media\nNBC: Native American Travels Across U.S. Photographing Citizens of Tribal Nations\nSeattle's Stranger: Shooting and Capturing: Matika Wilbur's Fierce Fight Against A Hundred Years of Native American Photography\nFusion: You've Never Seen Native America Like This\nIndian Country Today: Photographer Matika Wilbur's Three Year, 562 Tribe Adventure\nBecome A Project 562 Ambassador\nThe Project 562 Team is currently looking for Ambassadors that can assist with important tasks, including 2014 fundraising efforts; social media outreach; general outreach to tribal communities; educational lecture series outreach; and media outreach.

Then, after two months on the road, my bestie/companion/assistant decided that \"road life\" wasn't for her (I completely get it, sleeping on people's couches isn't glamorous, and I love her for coming at all). Nonetheless, I had to find the courage to forge the road alone. \n\nAnd even though I consider myself a Road Warrior, the road has worn on my spirit, and the constancy of travel has required an endurance that I didn't know that I was capable of. I have found a new strength; I didn't realize that all of the work I\u2019ve done in the past (photo school, commercial photographer, international journalist, at-risk tribal youth teacher and visual literacy professor) would lead to Project 562, but without the accumulation of those experiences, I wouldn\u2019t have the strength, knowledge, and courage to plunge onward into a multi-year national photography project.\n\nI have to tell you, I didn't anticipate that I would need to do a second fundraising campaign. I believed that if I applied for enough grants, one of them would say yes. Over the last year, I applied for 26 artists grants, even though I did receive 4 of them (thank-you), I was told by the others that, \"I am a risky investment\". Grantors see Project 562 as an improbable feat, and institutions don't want to give their money to risky artists.\n\nThat being said, I want you to know that I am progressing mightily despite institutional disbelief. I have been inspired by the \u201ckindness of strangers\u201d I have encountered. I have been motivated by the hope and light I see in the eyes of students and other youth I speak with. I have been rejuvenated by the kindness of the stranger's that I have encountered. I have been restored by the hope that I see in the eyes of students that I speak with.\n\nI had this incredible experience at the bottom of The Grand Canyon. The elders appointed a teenage boy to help me carry my equipment to photo shoots (since there aren't cars down there, and I'm clumsy on a horse). He was kind of quiet at first, standoffish even. But after the first interview and photoshoot, he was excited for the next one. He started suggesting ideas. I could see him listening as we spoke to his elders. That evening, he revealed that he had walked a despairing path, having struggled with depression and his own sense of Tribal identity. As I was leaving, he shyly pulled me aside, and told me that this project gave him a new sense of hope. He said that he believed in me. He said that I was the first lady that he'd ever met that had went on to \"do something\". He thanked me for giving him hope. He said that his experience with Project 562 had meant more to him than he could articulate. \n\nI repeatedly have experiences like the one in the Grand Canyon. Those experiences give me the strength to keep going; I genuinely believe that Project 562 will help to shift our collective consciousnesses toward respectfully recognizing the beauty of contemporary Native America.\n\nI know challenges lie ahead (and many, many miles), but I feel blessed with spirit and armed with the skills and tools to tackle them, whatever they may be.

I started writing at ten, teaching myself to touch type as well as how to use computers. Twenty three years later I'm an Apple girl (purely because of the accessibility options, honest) who swears by Scrivener, Aeon Timeline and Dropbox.\nOn a good day I can be found tapping away, on a bad one - caused by chronic anaemia - I can hardly get out of bed, much less leave the house which is where my iMac comes in. I worked as a freelance journalist for nearly a decade before my worsening vision and health problems forced me to realise I'm no longer able to work. \nI've always been visually impaired and this is no more obvious by the number of blind characters who crop up in my stories. In my case I have retinopathy of prematurity due to being born at twenty four weeks which left me with white matter damage to my brain from too much oxygen, a blind right eye and a blurry left one. I also have Asperger's though that can sometimes be more of a boon than a bane, especially when it comes to research. Three years ago I qualified with my lovely guide dog, Unis, and she serves me very well, allowing me to go out safely as well as keeping me company while I write.\nThe dynamic duo; Uni and Lesley\nFor nearly a decade I freelanced for everyone - seriously, the list is as long as my arm - from anime magazines like NEO and Newtype USA to games publications including Kotaku and Official Xbox Magazine to newspapers like the Eastern Daily Press and The Guardian. Now I am recreating myself as an author, specifically focusing on science fiction and urban fantasy.\nI'm in the prime of life, apparently, so being retired as due to my disabilities is incredibly frustrating as I would love to work and put my skill sets to good use. Right now I'm trying to be proactive by doing lots of writing and I do stints writing novels or poetry and short or serial fiction. However there's a particular project I want to get beyond drafting and actually publish. \nAbout The Changing of the Sun\nMy magnum opus is the Ashterai Chronicles, a multi-work tale of the future and the past set on many worlds but principally Earth, Mnemosyne (a twilight world which serves as the seat for a governmental body called the Union) and the sun-kissed world of Coronis (known simply as Ishvei's World to the inhabitants). The Changing of the Sun is the first in a trilogy focusing on Coronis, one of the Union's founding worlds, and sees the planet weathering a massive solar storm which could end civilisation as it is known - but for a simple, forbidden prophecy that refuses to die. \nThe other two books in the trilogy The Water Children and The Calling will follow in 2015.\nThis is my temporary cover for The Changing of the Sun, the first of a trilogy set on an alien world being ravaged by a solar storm. The actual cover will be much more awesome and done by artist extraordinaire JASON GURLEY\nA religious planet, Ishvei's World - or Coronis to the people of Earth - is led by its Oracles. Blind and guided by the whisperings of their Disembodied Goddess, they shepherd the sun-kissed Kashinai tribes and clans towards the future, warning of any catastrophes or trials so that the people might prepare themselves. \nTraditionally the mantle of High Oracle is given to any blind woman who has a vision of the future and can pass a secret test. During The Changing of the Sun, this mantle is held by Jashri but her time is ending and that of Saiara is about to begin.\nSaiara's vision is one unlike any other Oracle has seen since Kaiene, the first to hold the title. She sees the anger of their star, Thaeos, as he focuses his rage on their tiny planet. She passes the Test and should be High Oracle but instead finds herself imprisoned and her lover banished from the city to an obscure, forgotten religious order.\nForced to fight for her life and those of the people who believe her, Saiara must guide them to the sacred Canhei Basin where they can weather the storm in safety. But she's not alone, true heroes never are as we follow not just her journey but those of others around her, including the mysterious Jeiana, a woman indwelt by an entity who is definitely not Kashinai.\nMap of Reskha: Before the Changing of the Sun (Created by Rob Antonishen of http://www.cartocopia.com)\nWant to know more?\nYou can also check out my Pinterest mood board for the trilogy by clicking here and read a sample of the first couple of chapters below.\nThe Changing of the Sun is around 120k in length and here's the official blurb:\nThose chased by destiny do not always run to its embrace - Kaiene the Blessed, first Oracle of Aia\nSaiara never wanted to be the High Oracle, much less a seer. Jeiana never expected to wake up when the wave took her and Casparias never thought he would be banished for doing his duty.\nOn the ancient world of Coronis, the days are getting hotter, the baelish are dying in the fields and no rain is falling. Something is wrong and the entire continent of Reskha can sense it but only the High Oracle of Aia has the power to voice their suspicions.\nThe eye of Thaeos, their solar deity, is falling upon their world and his gaze means fire and death. The Changing of the Sun is upon them.\nSaiara finds herself in a battle for not just hearts and minds but souls when she is given a vision of a cataclysmic solar event about to rock their planet. Sanctuary exists but time is running short and she is trapped against her will in a gilded prison ruled by her predecessor. Can she escape and find safety before Thaeos turns his rage upon their world and what will she have to sacrifice to save the people who love her?\nWhy am I doing a Kickstarter?\nI live on a fixed-income which is rather tiny. I could pay for all these things but it would take fives times as long plus I might have to give up eating. I want to see a book published in the next twelve months and this is the best way to see that happen.\nWhat is the money for?\nEditing the book to make it publishable.\nSeriously, though I'm a qualified journalist, this is actually much harder than it seems. This makes an editor THE most important part of the process, someone who can help me polish the story a thing of beauty and not a pile of rubbish. Fortunately I have a brilliant editor lined up and I am, of course, insisting on giving him money for his time.\nDesigning a professional cover \nYou know that adage 'never judge a book by it's cover'? Well it's a load of BS, I judge books by their covers all the time and I'm sure everyone else does too. \nMy Photoshop skills are woeful so I asked Jason Gurley - whom you may know not only as a writer (he's the author of Greatfall and Eleanor) - but also as the guy who designs covers for Hugh 'bestselling author of Wool' Howey) to do all the covers for all three books as well as as well as laying out the text.\nI chose Jason because he makes truly awesome covers ... (seriously, go look, now!) He could and probably should be employed by some of the best publishers on the market but instead he freelances and I'm blessed to have caught him and had him accept the commission.\nHere are some of my favourite Jason Gurley covers to give you an idea why I want him so badly.\nSo why are you paying for three covers? If things go well, The Water Children and The Calling will be unlocked as stretch goals! Plus, because this series a trilogy, it makes sense to get all three covers done by the same person and at the same time.\ne-book\nYep, it's the obvious format. An e-book will be made available in various formats (.epub/.pdf/.mobi) and sent to backers later in the year.\nThe costs of the various rewards\nMugs, art cards and posters will all cost money and this is something that final amount has to include.\n\nKickstarter and Amazon's fees.\nKinda obvious but if I reach my goal, Kickstarter get a percentage and so do Amazon for processing the payments. Go figure. \nBacker Bonus!\nInspired by the sheer amount of support I've gotten since putting this project live, once we get to 50% a bonus e-book will be unlocked for all backers who pledged \u00a315 (Kadian) or more!\nThis is what unlocks at 50% for delivery when the project funds!\nA prelude to the first novel in the series \"The Whispers in the Desert\" focuses on how a potter's daughter becomes an unlikely tyrant when rulership of an entires species unexpectedly sees her elevated to the highest position in the land.\nThe novella is around 26k and includes cameos by Eirian, Jashri, Kadian, Beren, Meresia and Taras of the Edoi and various other characters. It also includes exclusive extracts from Jashri's biography by the noted Kashinai theologian Mother Elyn London, who first appears in The Water Children.\nThis e-book be exclusive to my backers until Changing is released. You don't need to read the novel and actually this should help introduce the world of Coronis. Be warned, this is not a happy story but it is one which cried out to be told.\nStretch Goals!\nLet's imagine, for a minute, that everything goes swimmingly. I don't want to be greedy but what is the point of a Kickstarter without some incentives to go further?\nBefore I begin, this is important: Even if I only just hit my goal, even if none of the stretch goals are met, the second and third books will still come along, it will just take a bit more time.\nWith that in mind:\n\u00a32000 - The Changing of the Sun print edition\nI want a print run, I really do; Jason Gurley covers demand it and so this is the first stretch goal. Anyone who pledges \u00a315 or more will get one.\n\u00a32500 and \u00a33000 - The Water Children\nIf we hit \u00a32500, The Water Children will be unlocked in e-book. Everyone who gives over \u00a315 will get a copy and massive kudos.\nIf the project hits \u00a33000, the print edition of The Water Children will be unlocked. Everyone who gives over \u00a315 and requested a print copy will get one.\nIn the interests of honesty, The Water Children is at 30k, I expect the first draft to be finished by June. I hope to have it published by Christmas 2014.\nHere's the temporary cover for The Water Children. I promise the final version will be much more shiny!\nHere the blurb for the book:\nThe ocean is eternal; as deep as the heart, as clear as the soul. Within it all secrets hidden will, one day, be found - A Seaborn adage, author unknown\nCenturies after The Changing of Sun and Coronis is a different world. Seas have risen, lands have changed and against all odds the children of Ishvei have survived great adversity.\nJannah the Pious has led the diaspora of clans back from Canhei and, from the new-born capital of Kasan, has instructed archeologists to travel to the ruins of the great cities, to Ossoi and the ruins of Danshu, to retake the unexplored south and resettle the hubs of civilisation left to the ravages of time.\nFree-diver An'she and her twin, atheist Sarai have been assigned to the team investigating Danshu and the drowned ruins of Aiaea. Touched by forces neither can understand, Sarai is terrified of the water and haunted by the songs of the Water Children that torment her every waking moment. An'she, on the other hand, relishes her chance to use her talents and finds a strange familiarity in the water-swamped streets of the sunken city.\nNeither woman knows, however, that they are being watched by more than one pair of eyes. Deep below Danshu, the Forgotten Ones are preparing for the annual rituals of the Falling and the Rising when matured Seranoa begin their pilgrimage in the ocean of space. Above Ishvei's World, alien eyes are watching and no one quite expects the cataclysmic collision which leaves Kella, daughter of the ship's captain, stranded on an alien world with no way home.\nThrough the eyes of the sons and daughters of Ishvei it is time to return to a world much changed, as secrets are revealed and the Water Children Rise.\n\u00a33500 and \u00a34000 - The Calling\nIf we hit \u00a33500, the e-book of the final book, The Calling, will be unlocked! Everyone who gives over \u00a315 will get a copy and massive kudos. \nIf the project hits \u00a34000, the print edition of The Calling will be unlocked. Everyone who gives over \u00a315 and requested a print copy will get one.\nAnd here's The Calling cover ... Again, it's purely to give you something to look at. The final cover will be awesome.\nHere's the blurb:\nWe are all - regardless of world of birth or creed - brothers and sisters in the great kishai - Kashinai proverb, author unknown\nIshvei's World endures, the glittering jewel of the Union crown, yet has been without an Oracle, a Voice of Aia, for a generation. After Contact with a world named Earth, this peaceful planet has become a battlefield for souls and all Esca wants is to go home, to the planet she was born on.\nSpirited away by the previous Oracle's daughter, Esca is the only survivor of an incident so terrible it has rocked both Earth and Coronis to their cores. Sequestered in the temple in the melting-pot of Kasan for her own protection, Esca must tell the greatest of lies to save her own life. As family chase her across the stars, as relations with Earth begin to fray, Esca must choose between the family she has chosen and the one she was born into, life and death and a role that she does not want to play.\nThe first draft of The Calling is done (I know, weird right?) It needs at least two more drafts, one including a perspective change. It currently stands at 100k and I'm aiming to have it done by late summer and published in early 2015.\nThank you!\nCrowd-funding is about making dreams reality. Mine is small but precious to me and I can't wait to bring you along on what promises to be a roller-coaster as we go from final draft to publication.

Let's delight them, plus your other friends, family, co-workers and more, together.\nThere's a reason the saying \"Oldies but goodies\" exists. Elders are society's greatest treasure-- they support us, share their wisdom, and give us unconditional love. They bridge us to the past, and impact generations to come. They teach us to read, bake us cookies, play cards with us, show us how to knit, and make our lives richer. But, as we grow older, too often we get too wrapped up in our busy lives to keep in touch with them consistently, when it really matters. Even a simple hello can make all the difference when an elder is bored, hurting or lonely.\nAfter talking with my Oma and her friends, I've designed a product I think elders will love, based on their feedback that even simple ongoing communication from their families can enrich their lives. I'm making it easy for you to keep in touch with your grandparents and anyone else you'd like, through these awesome Kickstarter rewards. Don't worry about forgetting to send something, keeping track of dates, trying to remember addresses, going to the store to shop for cards, or running to the post office- I've got your back. You can improve the life of someone you care about by backing this project today!\n When you support this project, I'll make sure your favorite person receives:\nPersonalized communication from you. I'll help you write the perfect card. I'll design it beautifully, print it clearly so that elders can easily read it, sign it for you, and prompt you with questions to answer, so I can send a heartfelt message with news from you.\n&\nGoods they'll love. I'll print three 4x6 photos you provide (or 4x4 photos if you'd like to use photos from Instagram), and depending upon the plan you select, occasionally include cool bonus treats like organic tea, photo-magnets and more (if you choose this reward you get to vote, and the most popular good will be included!)\n1. Pick the reward you want to send. Just select how often you'd like to keep in touch with your elder.\n2. Give me the details. I'll compose a personal note from you on the exclusive card I've designed, by prompting you with questions, and remind you to provide me with three photos, every month via email.\n3. Smile. I'll create your gift, ship it and delight your favorite elder.\nI'll create and provide a nice mix of types of cards for your elder, without any branding, so it truly looks like their gift came right from you. This project is the only way anyone can gain access to these exclusive card designs! I hope to team up with independent designers, each for a series of six.\nI've already developed a series of greeting cards, created with photographer Lisy McIntee, that sweeps elders on an adventure around the world, featuring the stunning slopes of the Rockies, the calm of a quiet morning in Germany, a brilliant sunset on the Golden Coast, and beyond. And, the other series I've already created showcases original hand-drawn illustrations by me. Here are just a few examples of the cards your favorite elders might receive (more are in the works, so each month I'll select the perfect card to send):\nPhoto series greeting card\nPhoto series greeting card\nPhoto series greeting card\nPhoto series greeting card\nPhoto series greeting card\nHand illustrated series greeting card\nHand illustrated series greeting card\nHand illustrated series greeting card\nHand illustrated series greeting card\nPlus, just let me know your person's birthday date if it falls within your subscription, and I'll send them a birthday card instead of the normal card that month! And, because I truly want to do everything possible to help you make the lives of everyone you love better...\nYou can even download it for FREE here (once you're on the page just right-click to save the image)! Print it out on a card to send to them (works up to 5x7 size), or send a quick email their way with it embedded.\nHand illustrated birthday card\nI'll print off three 4x6 photos you provide (or 4x4 if you prefer Instagram photos) and include them with the card.\nI'll include a surprise good in one of your sends to delight the person of your choice, if you pick the year-long reward. (If you choose this reward you get to vote between tea, photo-magnets and more, and the most popular good will be included!)\nPhoto-Magnet (High-quality print 2 inches x 2 inches)\nThe images from the cards sent out each month, but as flat .jpgs and via email. That way you still get access to the one-of-a-kind designs as I release them each month, and you can print them out on your own card stock or send them on via email to your favorite elder. Plus, I'll be reminding you to keep in touch on a regular basis!\nDon't worry, if you'd like to support the movement but there's no one you want to keep in touch with, I've still got something for you...\nA short message from this special elder could be all yours!\nI'm raising money to support my dream of improving grandparents' and every elder's quality of life. My goal is to impact 500+ elders directly through this Kickstarter project. Some of the many costs involved include:\nA great quality printer for photos and cards: $999\nPhoto-paper: $20/100\nInk: $60/100\nGreeting cards: $20/100\nLetterpress plates: $100\nEnvelopes and postage: $100/100\nPaying independent designers to team up for one-of-a-kind card lines: $100+/design\nA Web site, hosting, url, developer and designer: $1000+ (I'd like to integrate the site with Instagram and/or Facebook so eventually you can just tag photos and we'll know to print those out for that month. And, potentially even integrate with SMS or create an app so you can do everything on the go.)\nMy great-grandparents helped my parents raise me, and made me who I am today, and I have so many wonderful memories of our times together.\nDuring college I was on a sports team and was featured on a poster advertising our upcoming events that season. To help spread the word, our coach volunteered to send the posters to anyone we'd like, on our behalf. I had one sent to my great-grandparents, and within two weeks I received an amazing handwritten card back from them-- thanking me for sending the poster, telling me how much they loved it, and including $5 so I could treat myself and my roommate to some ice cream! And, the next time I went to visit my great-grandparents, they took me right upstairs to show off the bedroom corner where the poster was proudly displayed. This experience made me realize what a huge impact something so little could have on the life of a grandparent, parent or any elderly person.\nAfter that, I vowed to do a better job keeping in touch, but always found myself \"too busy\" (aka watching Netflix, sleeping, going shopping with friends, etc) to go to a convenience store for a card, write a note, remember the right address and mail it, or too overwhelmed by the thought of picking up the phone-- and days turned into weeks which turned into months. Anyhow, now it's too late for me and my great-grandparents, as they have both gone on to a better place, which is what inspired me to start this project. My great-grandparents deserved something more from me and I let them down. I want do better for my other grandparents before it's too late, and for you and yours.\nJoin me in making and keeping a New Years resolution that really matters.\nWhile my face might be a bit deceiving, I swear I loved these two.\nIn loving memory of my Mom Mom and Pop Pop.\nTHANK YOU so much for your support and interest!

Get involved in the movement by sharing your memories, stories and photos of the elders you care about on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and more using the hashtag #oldiesbutgoodies!

With five years experience running a greeting card business both online and within four local shops, I'm uniquely suited to deliver upon this project. Here are potential challenges I'll face:\n\n1. It's essential I receive answers to questions and photos from backers every month they're subscribed, in order for me to fulfill their rewards. Solution: Communication is key! Yay for Google calendar alerts and the Passion Planner project I recently supported on Kickstarter, which will help keep me focused on my goals.\n\n2. Printing and fulfillment will be a big part of this project. Solution: I've researched numerous printers in Denver that I can use.

Solution: Get packages into the mail within plenty of time to get it to each elder that month.

It allowed them to fully regenerate, reducing sleep time to 6.5 hours or sometimes just 2 hours. And those guys got things done!\nFamous polyphasic sleepers\nScience that helps you sleep. (Details)\nNeuroOn is a wearable sleeping mask that measures your biological signals, including: brain waves (EEG - electroencephalography), muscle tension (EMG - electromyography) and eye movements (EOG - electrooculography).\nAll the data collected from a user's sleep is transformed from analogue readings to digital analysis and sent via wireless interface fully compliant with Bluetooth 4.0 LE to a smartphone application.\nWiring diagram\nWhen you sleep, you go through two phases: REM and NREM and one follows the other. Using intelligent analysis based on data collected by the NeuroOn, the device will wake you up after your last REM phase, allowing you to feel fully rested and energized.\nData collection and communication\nThanks to the use of the newest technologies we were able to create a device that will improve your effectiveness and concentration at work to the best possible levels. Measurements of EEG, EOG and EMG, coupled with the usage of artificial intelligence, allows us to create the world's first digital sleep-control system that provides accuracy close to professional polisomnographic clinics. It's a whole new level above current, simple solutions that only use accelerometer readings to detect sleep phases. The NeuroOn reads biological signals direct from your body, allowing for super precise and in-depth measurements.\nNeuroOn construction\nNeuroOn will be powered with the inner battery. It will be rechargeable using micro-USB charger. The battery works for at least 10 days.\nPLAY\n\nThere\u2019s an app for that!\nNeuroOn is managed by a smartphone Android and iOS application so that you have full control over your sleep cycles.\nWhen you are sleeping, the app is working hard to learn your personal sleeping preference and style. Yeah, you\u2019ve got style!\nOur intelligent algorithms calculate your individual sleep patterns. The NeuroOn app not only records your sleep data, but also helps you to analyze and optimize your sleep to make sure you enjoy your every waking moment.\nUsing the app, you can access your complete and personalised data about your sleep and rest at any time.\nYou can then analyze your data to choose the best sleeping pattern for you, reducing both stress and fatigue.\nOh, and jet lag. Who needs it?\nNo more of that! With the NeuroOn mask you can manage your sleep and rest whenever and wherever you want - not just when your travel plans make you. You can easily eliminate jet lag and travel without having to recharge after every flight!\nConsider turning on Polyphasic sleep mode.\nThis is supposedly the way Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, Nicola Tesla and, we suspect, Bruce Wayne, used to sleep. Sleep less yet have more energy. Enjoy longer, more efficient days. Sleep a total of just 2 hours a day and let your productivity soar.\nWith NeuroOn you could sleep/ nap wherever you want.\nAm I dreaming? \nThe NeuroOn can pinpoint the exact start of your REM phase. NeuroOn has technology that helps you induce lucid dreaming, whenever you want. So you can literally control your dreams.\nDreamy design\nWe went through dozen of designs, working tirelessly on the look and feel of the NeuroOn.\nProduct early sketches\nIt took months to create the final artificial intelligence algorithms, which fit the bill. Today we finally have our working prototype and we\u2019re ready for start manufacturing!\nProduct early sketches vol. 2\nOn the inside, we make the NeuroOn from soft, comfortable materials with the ability to adjust to your face, thanks to the use of viscoelastic foams - the latest version of memory foam.\nProduct early sketches vol. 3\nThe outside of the mask is fully customizable with various designs, including your own designs, so you can sleep in style.\nEvolution of PCB\nTo receive bioelectrical signals we use the electrodes created from electroconductive dry materials. Our electrodes are not going to co-operate with traditional EEG or ECG machines because of their high resistance and high level of contact potential difference. A substantial problem is the sizeable difference of resistances between the couples of electrodes in one canal.\n\nPCB version 1.0\n That's why we decided to build a dedicated and extraordinary biological amplifier which manages measurements perfectly in adverse conditions. With the aid of our original construction there is no need to humidify electrodes before using them. It's enough to put your finger on the surface and you'll see smooth ECG signal. If you want to see EEG waveform simply apply electrodes to your forehead, it's easy as that!\nPCB version 2.0\nPCB version 2.1\nPCB version 2.2 under construction\nAttached below are the waveforms of ECG, EEG and EOG signals registered by our team. When you look at the spectrogram you can easily see the level of particular componential frequencies which distinguish relaxation state from the concentration state that are followed one by one in 15 second intervals. When a person is focused on solving a task and his or her frontal lobe is activated, a major action of faster beta waves occurs in the band above 16 Hz. In the opposite situation - relaxation state - you can observe lack of the aforementioned activity and an increase in alpha waves\u2019 amplitude 15 sec. after finishing the task.\nECG signal (chest)\nECG signal (fingers)\nEOG (eye movements)\nEEG (brainwaves during the concentration)\nOne of the main features of our biological amplifier is an ability to change parameters of its own analogue track. During profiling the signals it can easily switched from tracking high-amplitude signals (like the ECG) to the lower ones (like brain waves) in the suitable moment. There's no black box magic in it, only pure and advance engineering and our original patents. Not to mention that our device is fully safe and energy-saving, it can work steady one week without charging regardless of what power (battery or accumulator) you will use.\nSleep safe\nThe electronics at the heart of the NeuroOn provide the highest precision of sleep measuring. Crucially, for the user's safety, data is only transmitted when the mask is not touching the user's face. Data transmission to the smartphone only occurs when you take the mask off in the morning.\nSleeping with NeuroOn is comfortable in every position.\nWhen you rest, it\u2019s a comfortable sleeping mask. When you wake up, it becomes a superhero mask, setting you up for whatever lies ahead.\nColorful foams\nThe competition? They must be dreaming!\nNeuroOn provides a whole new level of sleep monitoring and optimization. All the other smartphone apps and sleeping solutions currently available, that claim to analyze and help you sleep efficiently, rely purely on accelerometer readings.\nYour every twist and turn affects the \u201csleep analysis\u201d and can completely nullify all the data collected.\nAccelerometer is less precise than biological signal processing\nOnly the NeuroOn analyzes your movement, your eye movement and your brainwaves all together for super accurate and reliable readings. Using an accelerometer alone is like using one note to compose a symphony.\nCurrent prototype (the backside view)\nCurrent prototype (the frontside view)\nThe President of Poland - our Honorable #001 User\nPLAY\n\n  We were given an opportunity to pitch NeuroOn for the most influential people of Poland, including the President. He loved our product and devoted almost half the duration of his speech to it, eager to learn more. We were truly honored to present a NeuroOn mask (formerly \u2018Zizz\u2019) to the President, who became our first user!\n\n\nKamil Adamczyk is handing over the smart sleep mask to the President\nKnow who you\u2019re getting into bed with\nWe\u2019ve always dreamt about great technology and our passion is the human brain \u2013 eminent and inscrutable. We have all chosen our unique areas of study independently in varying fields, but we\u2019ve combined our expertise to create an incredible product.\nKamil Adamczyk pitch at Ennovation conference\nKnowing more about the brain (undoubtedly the most important and fascinating part of the human body) is something we will definitely want to achieve. We want to know it better, reach deeper and create new technologies to change both the world we live in and your lives!\nNeuroOn team\nSpecial Thanks\nPeople who helped us the most!

We've created a line of versatile, rugged bags inspired by our hometown and made in America.\nWho We Are and How We Got Here\nWe know bags. Our team has been making industry-leading backpacks and shoulder bags for the photographic industry for years. Our existing products are designed, tested and sold from our HQ in Ogden, Utah, and sewn in Vietnam.\nNearly six months ago, we started sketching some new bags just for us, based on things we wanted in our everyday lives. We discovered creating these bags in our own sewing room was fun, and we love being able to touch and feel the process from inspiration to execution. Our bags are made one at a time and imbued with our passion for functional, clean designs. This made us think...\nWe looked around our community and saw an opportunity - to create local jobs and products to help shape the future of Ogden. We took an empty room, filled it with a few state-of-the-art sewing machines and found talented Ogden locals with a passion for well-crafted goods. We codenamed the project 'Ogden Made\u2122'. \nAwesome bags Made in Ogden, USA. Each one signed and dated by the person who made it. We've done the hard part by investing in equipment and finding talented craftspeople. Now we need your support to make Ogden Made a reality!  We are turning to Kickstarter to fund the first run of production of our bags.\nThe Products\nOgden's history, culture, people and buildings continually inspire us. Ogden is a town with hidden prohibition-era speakeasies, magnificent art deco buildings contrasted against rugged mountains, and a can-do spirit when faced with long odds. That's our inspiration. So when we began naming our products, we naturally looked to that tradition to lead the way.\nThe Junction City\u2122 Messenger\nOur signature bag carries Ogden's nickname, the Junction City. Ogden is at the crossroads of the US rail system - we even have a golden spike to prove it. There was an old saying that to get anywhere you had to go to Ogden first. Reflecting our city's rugged and plainspoken lifestyle, the Junction City Messenger is made from equally durable and rugged CORDURA\u00ae 1000D fabric to ensure it stands up to your toughest challenges.\nThe Junction City is a messenger with grit and grace. Each bag is carefully handcrafted with tried and trusted CORDURA\u00ae and/or our custom X-Pac\u2122 ripstop fabric and an obsessive amount of pride. To work, to play, or to the other side of the globe, the Junction City will carry your essentials with unpretentious style. \nThe Junction City Messenger is available in two sizes\nSmall fits up to 11\" MacBook in Transient sleeve\nMedium fits up to 15\" MacBook in Transient sleeve\nKey Feature Overview\nConstructed from tough 1000D CORDURA\u00ae \nLarge exterior pocket with key hook and water-resistant YKK\u00ae zipper\nPockets wide enough for a iPad, Kindle, or book\nSmaller pockets with dividers for pens, pencils, phone and other small items\nSecure velcro closure keeps all your stuff inside the bag\nIntegrated buckles and straps helps keep everything secure\nQuick adjusting 2\u201d webbing strap with shoulder pad (Customizable for left or right shoulder)\nIt's available in two sizes, medium and small. The medium is large enough to fit a 15\u201d MacBook in one of our Transient Sleeves, plus everything you need to get through your busy day while the small is large enough to fit an 11\u201d MacBook in a Transient Sleeve, plus your lunch and a jacket. The front pockets are designed for an iPad Mini or if most other small tablets.\nMedium Junction City Messenger:\nExterior Dimensions 20\u201d x 12\u201d x 6\u201d\nInterior Dimensions 10\u201d to 18\u201d x 11\u201d x 5 3/4\u201d\nSmall Junction City Messenger:\nExterior Dimensions 16\u201d x 11\u201d x 4\u201d \nInterior Dimensions 8\u201d to 14\u201d x 9 1/2\u201d x 4\u201d\nThe Transient\u2122 Tablet & Laptop Sleeves\nOgden is as much about the folks who traveled through as those who stayed and called it home. Throughout WWII, soldiers came to Ogden on their way to training, deployment and home. And as a result, a good portion of Ogden's history and vitality came from those just passing through - the transients.\nIf you are anything like us, your technology travels with you for both work and fun. We designed our Transient Tablet and Laptop Sleeves to look equally comfortable at the office on Monday morning as they are all weekend in the mountains. Transients are designed to protect your technology from the everyday bumps and scrapes without being complicated or pretentious. \nExterior Construction: Tough & protective X-Pac\u2122 laminated fabric and 1000D CORDURA\u00ae\nInterior Lining: Soft & cushioned custom-made quilting (50D soft nylon facing with a 6 oz polyester fill backing)\nStrategically placed and hidden velcro closure holds your technology in place\nSized to fit: iPad Mini\u00ae, iPad 2\u00ae, iPad Air\u2122, 11\u201d MacBook Air\u00ae, 13\u201d MacBook Air, 13\u201d MacBook Pro\u00ae or 15\u201d MacBook Pro\nThe Boxcar\u2122 Dopp Kit\nThe Boxcar is inspired by the Dopp kit, a fixture of first class train travel and eventually issued to every GI coming through Ogden in WWII. Almost 100 years ago, Charles Doppelt was somewhere in a bathroom fumbling for a place to store his straight razor and horsehair brush. In 1919 he introduced the Dopp kit into the world and things have never been the same. We\u2019d like to think Mr. Doppelt would be pleased with our rendition of his ingenious product.\nShaped like a Union Pacific boxcar and just as roomy, the Boxcar Dopp Kit holds your shaving kit or other stuff like power blocks and cables just as easily. \nShaving cream and toothpaste-proof X-Pac laminated fabric bottom\n1000D CORDURA\u00ae fabric top\nWater-resistant YKK zippers\nWebbing handle for hanging or carrying\nExternal Dimensions: 8 1/2\u201d l X 4 1/4\u201dw X 2 3/4\u201d h\nThe Divide\u2122 Accessory Cases\nOgden is nestled on the western side of the Wasatch Mountains. The North Ogden Divide is a beautiful mountain pass with amazing views of the Great Salt Lake, Ogden and northern Utah. We named our accessory pouches in honor of this gorgeous pass over the mountains.\nDesigned to carry all the flotsam that comes with your daily life, the Divide Series of cases come in three sizes and two styles. The Twisted Divide is a pencil case with a quirk that allows it to lay flat when full and expand when you open it to see all the goodies it carries. Both of the Flat Divide cases hold every little thing for your day's adventures - pens, ear buds and power cords all tucked away and tidy. They all fit a standard Apple power block and are constructed with our custom X-Pac\u2122, 1000D CORDURA\u00ae accents and a water-resistant YKK zipper. \nTough as nails 1000D CORDURA\u00ae and custom X-Pac\u2122 construction\nWater-resistant YKK zippers\nEach are 8 1/2\u201d wide in varying lengths from 4\u201d to 8\u201d.\nAvailable Colors\nWe've put together a palette of CORDURA\u00ae colors we love:  Beehive Yellow, Mandarin Orange, Firehouse Red, Sky Blue, Beach Sand and Moonlight Silver (yeah, we like fancy names for colors).  Plus our custom X-Pac\u2122 comes in Black.   All the colors are available in all our products.\nFor the Junction City Messengers we pair an exterior color with a contrasting bright interior so you can see what is in bottom of your bag.   You may choose your favorite colors for any of our rewards.   We have several favorite color combinations for the Junction City Messengers:\n - Silver exterior with Red or Sky Blue interior and accents\n- Sand exterior with Orange or Sky Blue interior and accents\n- X-Pac\u2122 Black exterior with Sand, Silver or Blue interior and accents\nSketch, Sew, Refine, Design Complete\nWe started with an idea that we could build a bag for ourselves that was simple and elegant, yet tough. Sketches filled our notebooks. Our office white board was written on, erased and written on again and again. All the while we were creating bags in the sewing room. \nThe first bag from our sewing room was olive drab green and pretty rough.  But it was a starting point.  From there we spent the next six months sewing prototypes and arguing over details like zipper direction and buckle selection. We asked our friends to test our prototypes and adjusted the pocket configuration and strap style in response to their feedback.  We found that paper prototypes helped us check the size, shape and concept of our bags.  And then we got back to sewing.\nAs our messenger bag came together we realized several things: shortcuts are for nincompoops and don't result in inspired design. Quality construction takes patience and skill. So we ditched the idea of binding the interior lining to the exterior of the bag in favor of sewing the two together, laboriously turning them inside out and letting the interior and exterior become their own finished edges with a color matched top stitch. It's definitely not easier, but it's simply better. We then created our own custom CORDURA\u00ae binding for any exposed edges like pockets. Does this take longer and cost more? Sure thing, but it results in a clean functional design that we love.\nOur accessory cases and sleeves took the same path as the development of our messenger bags.   We started with what we wanted to carry in each accessory and translated that into sewn prototypes that were tested and refined, argued over and sized up and sized down until we got it right.\nWe knew the materials had to be right. Again, no shortcuts. This meant working with our suppliers to develop a new material as well as relying on materials that have proven themselves over time. Costs have never been the driving force behind our material choices. That would be like serving ramen on a yacht. We're not about that.\nWe chose a fabric from CORDURA\u00ae that's tough as nails and looks and handles well.  Not only does CORDURA\u00ae 1000D have decades of real world proven durability but is also made and sourced in America. We then worked with one of our favorite American mills to produce a custom version of our favorite fabric, X-Pac\u2122.  Our X-Pac\u2122 RS has a ripstop facing that resists tears and specialized PU coating that is water-resistant with a taffeta lining for beauty and durability.  Bottom line, it's awesome.\nChoose Your Reward\nFulfillment Plan\nOur in-house sewing production facility will handle all bag and accessory production and fulfillment for this Kickstarter project and beyond.  We've found talented craftspeople who have been intimately involved in the prototyping phase of our project so they know how to sew each one of the products we make.  \nWe have accumulated an inventory of fabric and the other necessary materials to produce a limited amount of our product. In addition, we have established relationships with several suppliers so that we can easily replenish fabric and other material inventory as needed.  All patterns are made and final materials have been selected and sourced.\nAs soon as our Kickstarter project funds we will begin production on all Early Bird Specials.  We have specifically limited the number of Early Bird Specials to what our current capacity can produce and ship within a few days.  All other rewards will be placed on our production calendar for completion, quality control and shipment by the end of February. Should this project blow up, we have cultivated contacts with reliable contractors with whom we have worked before who will provide back up sewing production capabilities.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have reached deep in to our pockets and collected enough change to invest in the equipment and talented passionate craftspeople necessary to start this project. Now we are turning to Kickstarter to fund the first run of production of our bags.

So that being said, the more successful this campaign is, the more jobs you help us create. We only ask that if that be the case, you be patient with us as we try to increase our production capabilities to get orders out as fast as we can.\n\nAdditional risks and challenges may include turnaround times by our suppliers.

We pushed through boundaries set by the \u201cstatus quo\u201d and kept challenging ourselves to create the best, most innovative sleeping bag possible.  After years of iterations, the result was something revolutionary - a redefinition of what a sleeping bag should be.\nThe predominate theme for designing the Thylacine\u2122 is extremely simple: Give Power to the People! Our goal is to give you the most functionality & versatility in one sleeping bag system. Period. You get to choose the best customized sleeping bag set up for every adventure. Our mission is to design products for your life-changing adventures, and we know your adventures are always changing!  \nThe Thylacine\u2122 adapts to your specific needs, and delivers endless options to unleash your creativity as you interact with the natural world. The Thylacine can become any bag you need it to be due to its patent-pending Variable Warmth Technology\u2122 (interchangeable baffle system) and Customfit\u2122 size adjustments.\nVariable Warmth Technology\u2122 delivers complete customization through a system of changeable insulated baffles. The baffles can be filled with synthetic, down, or a hybrid of both types of insulation. Although baffles are common in most sleeping bags, the ability to remove and change the baffles is an entirely new concept specifically designed to meet the needs of every adventure. \nThe Thylacine uses a patent-pending locking feature that keeps the baffles properly positioned inside the baffle chamber to prevent cold spots. The baffles are created using an ultralight downproof fabric that is quilted in order to minimize the migration of insulation. By simply removing or adding baffles to the baffle chambers, you can create the customized temperature rating you need for whatever adventure awaits you.  \nExample:\n\"Our first night in Patagonia was spent in the valley of El Chalten where the temperature reached a low of around 40\u00b0F. One layer of synthetic baffles created a 40\u00b0F bag and kept us warm. However, a 25\u00b0F bag would have been uncomfortably hot! The second night we made camp near the glacier where the cold wind came down off glacier. The lowest temperature that night was around 20\u00b0F - and it was sleeting/windy. By simply adding a second layer of baffles in each chamber, we created a 25\u00b0F bag. Another layer of synthetic baffles would bring the rating to 0\u00b0F. In owning the Thylacine bag with three layers of baffles, you actually have 4 complete sleeping bags in one!\" - Greg McEvilly\nPrimaLoft\u00ae Gold Synthetic is the highest performing insulation on the market for warmth, water resistance, softness and compressibility. PrimaLoft\u00ae Gold is an ultra-fine microfiber insulation that is as soft, lightweight, and warmer, wet or dry, than all other insulations. Ultra-fine fibers form tiny air pockets to trap body heat and keep the cold out. The result is immediate warmth without the bulk. PrimaLoft\u00ae Gold microfibers are engineered for permanent water resistance and create tight surface tension that resists moisture penetration, resulting in an insulation that dries faster than goose down. Ultra-fine fibers mimic the compressibility of goose down and are breathable, allowing moisture to be transported through the fibers and away from the skin. \nPrimaLoft\u00ae Down Blend is the ultimate combination of PrimaLoft\u00ae ultra-fine fibers and water repellent goose down, offering high-performance warmth and comfort in variable conditions while adhering to the PrimaLoft\u00ae promise of an environmentally safe technology free of fluorocarbons.\nPrimaLoft\u00ae Down Blend Gold is a unique blend of premium quality environmentally friendly water resistant 750 fill power grey goose down with PrimaLoft\u00ae ultra-fine denier fibers.  Our hybrid insulated baffles feature a homogeneous blend of 30% PrimaLoft\u00ae ultra-fine fibers, and 70% of 750 fill power water resistant goose down. This combines the benefits of both worlds - offering the absolute best of Down & Synthetic in one fill type.\nThese width adjustments allows the you to modify the size of the bag as needed. The footbed adjustment allows the bag length to be resized 3\" - 5\" inches so that your feet are all the way down in the bag. Five body width adjustments allow you to customize the width of the bag at several critical points: chest, hips, thighs, knees and ankles. This allows for less dead space and increases thermal efficiency and comfort for the user.\nAtmos\u2122 is a 10D nylon ripstop made from high tenacity yarns offering unprecedented durability with thermal reflective properties.\nOne of the biggest challenges in creating an adaptable sleeping bag is managing the overall weight of the bag due to the necessary use of additional fabrics for encasing interchangeable baffles. To achieve a lightweight design, we had to look at making a new ultralight fabric with integrated thermal retention technology.\nThis problem forced us to think differently about fabric \u2013 the Thylacine \u201cshell\u201d and \u201cliner\u201d fabric needed to be multifunctional and offer greater thermal retention value than traditional ultralight fabrics. Increasing the thermal retention value of the fabric allows the use of less insulating \u201cfill\u201d in the interchangeable baffles \u2013 driving down total weight in a radical way.\nAtmos\u2122 is incredibly soft against the skin, and is used as the \u201cliner\u201d fabric for the Thylacine Ultralight\u2122 and Thylacine Expedition\u2122 bags. Atmos+\u2122 DWR is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish, and is used as the Ultralight bag shell fabric.\nThe newest textile development in Kammok\u2019s amphibious class is DART\u2122 \u2013 which stands for Dry Advanced Respiration Technology.  DART\u2122 fabric is used for the Expedition bag shell & offers some of the most waterproof & breathable advancements on the market.  DART\u2122 is powered by eVent\u00ae - a patented waterproof membrane that allows vapor to vent from inside the bag while keeping wind and water out.  \neVent\u00ae fabrics get their unique properties from a proprietary and patented waterproof membrane. Its unique composition allows millions of tiny pores to breathe at their full potential. Most common waterproof/breathable membranes do not literally \u201cbreathe.\u201d Instead, they move sweat in two slow steps by a process of diffusion through a Polyurethane (PU) layer. Because a PU absorbs and retains sweat, the inside of the fabric becomes wet. Body heat begins to push the dampness through to the outside of the fabric where it can finally evaporate\u2013a very inefficient process. eVent is the most advanced breathable & waterproof membrane available today!\nThe Thylacine Ultralight\u2122 and Expedition\u2122 shells are uninsulated (when baffles are removed) sleeping bags, similar to a liner, but with all the features of a sleeping bag.  With the baffles removed, the Ultralight can be a summer degree bag, and the Expedition \u201cX\u201d shell can be an uninsulated waterproof bivy - both can be reconfigured as needed.  \nSuper Ultralight sleeping bag shell that compresses into a softball sized stuff sack (uninsulated). The Thylacine UL\u2122 sleeping bag shell features Kammok\u2019s proprietary Atmos+\u2122 fabric with heat reflective technology and a DWR finish. The UL liner is made of Atmos\u2122 - giving a silky soft feel. The Thylacine UL also features a waterproof footbox.\nThe Thylacine X\u2122 is a waterproof bivy/sleeping bag featuring Kammok\u2019s DART\u2122 Technology. DART\u2122 (Dry Advanced Respiration Technology) is an eVent based fabric is that is Waterproof, Windproof, and highly Breathable. The Thylacine X will be fully seam sealed for ultimate waterproofness and also features Atmos\u2122 fabric for the liner.\nUnlike traditional sleeping bags, the Thylacine Sleeping Bag System also allows you to easily wash and maintain your bag. Typically, when a sleeping bag needs to be washed, it is because the shell and liner are dirty, not the inner insulation. Thanks to Thylacine\u2019s removable baffles, the sleeping bag shell and the baffles can be washed and treated separately. This allows you to properly clean dirt and body oils from the shell and liner without compromising the insulating properties of the baffles.\nThe Thylacine line will undergo multiple certified lab tests which will evaluate the thermal performance of the sleeping bag according to EN 13537 requirements for Sleeping Bags (CEN, 2012).  Specifically, the Thylacine will be tested to determine the measured insulation values and the temperature limits that will determine the temperature comfort range.  \nWe will work diligently to achieve these temperature ratings, and share the testing results in Project Status Updates.\nThe Thylacine Sleeping Bag System allows for future customizations including internal head pillows, internal sleeping pads, and many other advancements in future insulation - further example of how and why this is the only sleeping bag system you will ever need to own! \nThe best trail rated quilt ever produced, the Firebelly\u2122 fuses luxurious comfort & technical back country functionality. Designed specifically for hammock users and the ultra-minimalist backpacker, the Firebelly\u2122 places all insulation on the sides & top of you and omits the bottom insulation (bottom insulation is often unusable when compressed in a hammock or when a sleeping pad is used). The Firebelly\u2122 will be rated at \u00b1 30\u00b0F, keeping you incredibly warm at a 'feather-light' weight.\nThe Firebelly\u2122 can be used as a traditional bed quilt when unbuttoned, or you can choose to secure the 5 button snaps and draw cord at the foot area to create a cosy warm foot box. When not in use on the trail, the Firebelly may be replacing Granny\u2019s old quilt on your couch!\nThe Firebelly\u2122 is now available on the right for $125 (WILL RETAIL FOR $250.00 = $125 IN PRE-MARKET SAVINGS!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the video/pictures you see of the Thylacine\u2122 are of a working prototype.

The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.\u201d \n\u2015 Christopher McCandless\nTHE MISSION \nTo create a photo story book that portrays inspiring stories of wanderers, travelers and nomads from all over the world. \nTo inspire people to travel, explore, get out of their comfort zones, and create their own paths.\nTHE STORYTELLER\nHello, I'm Stephanie. A photographer, writer, travel blogger, also known as Satori.\n\nTwo years ago, I opted out of college. I quit my job. And decided to create my own path. All I had ever wanted was to travel the world, take pictures, tell stories and inspire others. So I chose to do just that. I traveled to places in Central America and Asia. I was living nomadically with nothing but a backpack. I felt liberated. There were life-changing lessons I learned on the road I would have never learned through a book, a classroom, or a degree. The world has so much to teach us if we're brave enough to explore the unknown and leap into it with open arms. And it's all waiting for us at the other end of the flight.\n\nI created a blog called InfiniteSatori.org to document my journey and inspire other people along the ride. As my blog grew, my audience grew with it. I've received so many messages from people who have been inspired by my blog to the point where they started following their bliss and traveling the world.\n\nI was so happy that I made an impact in their lives. If one story like mine can inspire many, imagine what a whole book can do? Traveling opens us up to the world, our true selves and our life's purpose. Imagine if people gained the courage to leave their unfulfilling lives to travel the world, the journeys they will embark upon, and the many dreams that will come alive. This notion lights up my soul. And all I can think of is creating this special book.\nTHE BOOK \nSample of the hardcover photo book from Artifact Uprising\nSample of softcover photo book from Artifact Uprising\nI'm partnering with friends at Artifact Uprising to create the limited-edition Kickstarter version of this beautifully bound book. All other rewards will be created through Artifact Uprising as well.\nArtifact Uprising is a print company inspired by the disappearing beauty of the tangible and is a community of inspired storytellers. They are driven by the belief everyone has a story to tell. I couldn't find a more perfect company to collaborate with on this project. The book, including all other rewards are made from Mohawk Options 100% post consumer recycled paper. FSC Certified. Acid free. Manufactured with wind power.\n\nTHE JOURNEY\n I'm setting out on a quest. I will backpack by myself all throughout Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines, India & Nepal. I will find The Wanderers. This could be anyone from backpackers, to gypsies, to homeless nomads, to vagabonding families, to the holy men of India, to Bajau the sea gypsies of the Philippines, the the Moken nomads of Thailand who were displaced by the 2004 tsunami, to the wandering Hindu monks of Nepal. I will immerse myself into their lives, connect with them, photograph them, capture the essence of their beings, the essence of their lives. I will capture the human experience. \n\nEvery wanderer has an incredible story to tell, it just needs a little light. I truly feel that with all their stories, this book has the power to inspire the wanderer that resides in all of us. It will help give people the courage to get out of their comfort zones and live their dreams of traveling the world.\nOnce this project is successfully funded, I will be on the road for at least six months. No specific plans, just the skeleton of a journey and let serendipity work its magic. I'll live as cheap as possible and stay at hostels, couch surf, and live on the bare minimum I need to travel throughout the journey. \n\nIf anything resonates within you, if anything about this illuminates your soul and gives you goosebumps. Follow it and support this project. We are much more interconnected than we will ever know. This project isn't solely mine. It's for you. It's for the wanderer that resides in all of us.\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHY\n Click to see portfolio\n\n\nTHE REWARDS\nPostcards from Artifact Uprising\n5x5 square print set from Artifact Uprising\nHardcover books from Artifact Uprising\n                                                      THE MOVEMENT\nThis is more than just a book. Together, we are creating a movement. A movement that will inspire many. Traveling has a way of opening ourselves up to the world, discovering who we're meant to be, what we're meant to do, travel has created revelations and epiphanies that altered the course of history such as Che Guevara traveling in a motorbike all over South America and Charles Darwin in the Galapagos Islands. I believe that the book, this movement will inspire people to get out of their comfort zones, create their own paths and live their lives with passion, meaning, and adventure.\nFUNDING \n$20,000 is based on the absolute bare minimum I would need for this project. It includes travel expenses such as plane tickets, accommodation, food and transportation. Half of the funding will go towards the production and shipment of the rewards, the book reward is the Kickstarter limited-edition of the book. If there is extra left it will go towards any costs of publishing the final book. The other half will be used for my travels. Kickstarter and Amazon charges a total of 10% from the funds, so I will be left with 8,000 for travel. That would leave me at more or less 2,000-3,000 for plane tickets to and around Asia. And so I will be left with 5,000 to stretch as living expenses for as long as I can until I feel that my documentation and stories of The Wanderers are complete. This could take anywhere in between six months to a year. And I am willing to live as cheaply as I possibly can. I will not be staying in fancy hotels, or living lavishly. I never do. I will be staying at the cheapest hostels, couch surfing, camping, sleeping in god knows where, eating the cheapest street food, etc. This budget is just the bare minimum that I would need.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI will be traveling solo on this quest to bring the wanderers together so bear with me if any setbacks arises. As my supporters, I know you will understand gracefully. \n\nI will work hard as I go, updating the blog, posting up pictures of each wanderer I connect with, sending rewards throughout the journey and sending the book to all you amazing people once it is finalized. \n\nNote that this is not just a vacation for me. I will go through lengths to find stories, to find The Wanderers and to bring this book to life. And that requires a huge amount of my effort into this project on a daily basis, most especially while I am on the journey.\n\nAfter my journey I'll settle somewhere in Asia for a couple months to work on the book and get everything sent out to my backers as promised. With the support of some of my peers who I trust and love, we will produce the rewards in a timely manner.\n\nI'm very passionate about this project. And when I'm extremely passionate about something, I work hard and focus on producing the best final product. My vision has never been more clear. I will do everything I can to make this project come to life. \n\nSo I will do my best to give you the most compelling stories. The most beautiful images. And one incredibly inspiring book.

That's why we set out to create a secure, wallet solution with a slim and streamline design to fit all walks of life. By focusing on every detail, such as fit, finish, functionality, and aesthetics, we\u2019ve created a protective wallet solution in a class of its own. From the audible click-closure access drawer to our patent pending push and slide release system, we have gone above and beyond to transform the iPhone wallet into a secure, discreet, and stylish everyday solution.\nPush doesn't use elastic bands, pull-tabs, or bulky hinges. Other smartphone-wallets loudly display your cash & cards on the back of your phone-where over time they can even fall out. Shake it as hard as you can or drop it, Push can handle it. Push's front-facing wallet offers unrivaled security because your cards cannot fall out given any situation. This gives you the confidence that your essentials are completely concealed, safe, and secure no matter where you go and for your eyes only.\nPush is treated with a high-quality easy grip surface, giving it an elegant and fashionable finish with a smooth touch feel. The White Glacier, Pink Passion and all Artist series models come glossy with artwork professionally printed by an industrial sublimation service (the identical method & quality used by the highest end cases sold in Best Buy and Apple stores)\nGet in the fast lane and gain the rewards of saving time and space.\nYou see it more and more everyday. Smartphone wallets are on the rise, and for obvious reasons. Just like the way of the camera, calculator, notepad, calendar, and even our mailbox. Smartphones continue to absorb the most useful parts of our day and pack them all into your phone, keeping all those things right at your fingertips. Shift your paradigm to a simplified lifestyle and upgrade to Push for your iPhone 5S, 5C and iPhone 5. Never leave home without it, and never lose track of your wallet again because the next time you leave it in the car, or at home on the nightstand, there's no need for panic, now-a-days you just call it & GPS track it.\nOn the back, there is a button. Press and slide the button up (toward the top of your iPhone) to instantly access your cash, credit cards, business cards, ID.\nPlace whichever contents you wish into Push\u2019s front-facing wallet compartment and simply slide it back in. When the storage tray reaches its final position, an Automatic Locking mechanism is activated, letting you flow through your day knowing that all of your essentials are locked inside, safe and secure.\nPush tags along wherever you go. For work, a workout, at school, on vacation, or another night out. Leave your wallet or clutch behind.\nPush is versatile and fits any occasion\nPush fits 3 cards or 2 cards + cash\nPush makes an impression on everyone as it's the ONLY protective case that offers a premium look with a unique user experience\nEasy Access to all ports\nBoth the headset port lightning connector are easily accessible\nWe are technology entrepreneurs and prototyping enthusiast who care about what we design and build, especially the relationships that come along with building something as user-friendly as Push. We started building Push for fun about year ago. It began as a quest to make the ultimate wallet which quickly led to a the ultimate smartphone wallet because using one allows you the freedom of carrying one less thing--and that fits into everyone's schedule. We set out to design a wallet that would carry us through the entire day without ever reaching into an extra pocket or purse. We knew it had to look slim and feel great. We were tired of awful wallet solution (i.e. bulky or a pain to use). Many prototypes and iterations later, we've arrived at the ultimate grab-n-go wallet solution that we know you're going to love. As backers ourselves, we look forward to sharing Push with you and hope you join us in spreading the word to make Push, a reality.\nDurable & Dependable\nPush is made tough. An injected molded polycarbonate housing gives you the drop-worthy protection you need to go about your daily activities with ease. Push uses an auto-locking mechanism with stainless steel springs to project the hidden wallet drawer open. Push is engineered with the highest level of precision and successfully tested @ over 30,000 uses per month with a 100% success rate. How many times will you open your wallet per month?\n3D Printers can make great test-prototypes\nWe contracted Absurd Realities in Orange, Ca. for final mechanical design of our prototype\nAfter many months of hard work Push is ready to for prime time! We have finalized our design and have multiple manufacturers lined up. The prototypes that we have been using for the past several months work exactly how the final product is going to work and we just need the green light to start production.\nThe Kickstarter community has the amazing ability to turn ideas into reality. Push is the result of a year of research + feedback and we\u2019re excited to see it through. We need your support to create the most convenient and simple wallet solution. With your pledge, you\u2019ll help get production started as well as help fund the manufacturing process and quality control required to create a premium protective wallet innovation like Push.\nWe're honored to offer you Push limited edition Artists Series cases designed by DabsMyla, Tyke Witnes and eBoy with more artists soon to be announced.

We call this product the wipebook and we think it may just be the last whiteboard you ever buy!\nRewards!!\nPeople seem to be getting mixed up in the rewards and I don't blame them! This is our first kickstarter so I drew this little drawing to explain:\nStretch Goals:\nUnlike typical stretch goals, we have decided to created special rewards for early backers. As the number of backers increase, we will try to have a special gift at every 1000 backers. The earlier you pledge, the more bonus gifts you get! \nPlease note, the mystery gifts are not physical object, they will be similar to the 2000 backer gift. Think of it as something that is easy enough for us to fulfill, but shows our thanks to all those initial backers!\nKickstarting Wipebook 2.0  \nOur original Wipebook was a great validation test, and we managed to collect a ton of feedback from initial users. With this feedback, we've developed our new Wipebook 2.0! However, to keep costs low, Wipebooks need to be manufactured in huge quantities of 300 or more, which is why we are trying to raise 4000$ in pre-orders to develop this new batch. But you may ask, what's new with Wipebook 2.0?  \nNo more ghosting! With this new version, you can use a dry erase solution like a correctable marker without ghosting! The rough texture of the original Wipebook left subtle ghosting on the pages which wasn't ideal for re-usability. This new version is specifically made for dry erase and correctable markers, instead of water soluble markers!  \nSmoother Surface! The original Wipebook had a slightly rough texture to the pages. Users told us they wanted something that was as smooth as a typical whiteboard so that's exactly what we've done. Our new UV gloss solution makes each page especially smooth.  \nEasier to erase! The added smoothness of Wipebook 2.0 makes it especially easy to erase. No more scrubbing on the pages to wipe the correctable markers off the page.  \nMore sustainable! With the original plastic laminate, people didn't necessarily agree that our product was eco-friendly, so we switched the laminate for a new UV gloss that cuts down on the amount of plastic used for the book!\n  Check out this video to see the differences between the original Wipebook and Wipebook 2.0\nHow is the Wipebook made?\nNow the first prototypes of the Wipebook were made by taping up some good old transparent clear acetate sheets together,sandwiching them with a sheet of lined paper and binding them in a portfolio. This wasn't exactly the best prototypes but it worked. But when we wanted to produce them on a mass scale, we needed to go out and find someone who owned a print shop (had the basic glossing, laminating and binding machines) and would allow us to test various glosses that worked with water soluble and dry erase markers. We searched far and wide, but all the print shops we found would charge us an arm and a leg. That's when Toby (one of our co-founders) brought in one of his close friends Jimmy, who owns a print shop in downtown Ottawa (http://www.allegracarling.com/). As Frank designed the individual pages of the the book, Jimmy was then able to work very closely with us to fine tune the gloss, and produce the first large batches of the original Wipebooks. This is pretty much how the process went :\nWith Wipebook 2.0, the process will be very similar but we will be using a UV gloss instead of a laminate. This means a light spray will be applied to the pages and cured instead of melting sheets of laminate onto the pages. We have found this new technique to work extremely well with the books, and the best part is that it uses conventional printing technologies that are available at standard print shops. This makes the books extremely easy to mass produce!\nWhat will we be doing with our funding?\nFirst, we'll be mass producing a new batch of Wipebook 2.0 That's our number one priority. Secondly, we've been told time and time again that entrepreneurs need to validate their ideas with real customers before investing time and money and this kickstarter is that validation test for us. We really want to see if there is a widespread demand for our product before continuing the development of new versions. Some customers have asked for smaller versions of the book, others have asked for versions that include a grid patterns. As much as we'd like to offer these new versions, we can only keep the price down with economies of scale, and we need to validate that demand justifies this scale. So with extra funds, we will work towards developing new versions of our product.\nAlso, we'd like to become a distributor for staedtler correctable markers, because there is no Wipebook without a great writing tool. We consider the staedtler correctable markers to be the best writing tool for the Wipebook because its like a blend between a dry erase and permanent marker, which provides the best writing experience. However, we need to invest a considerable amount of money to become a distributor, so this kickstarter will enable us to distribute their great products.\nWho are we?\nTeam Wipebook was created on a late Tuesday evening in February, 2013, in an entrepreneurship course at the University of Ottawa. The MBA professor asked his class to form groups, with the primary objective of coming up with a business model that could be validated over the ensuing 6 weeks of the course.  Little did we know that 6 months later over 150 wipebooks units would be sold; exclusively by word of mouth.\nThe Inventor: Frank Bouchard\nFrank, the creative torque of the group, initially came up with the wipebook prototype. He completed his Masters in Engineering Management  at the University of Ottawa while working full-time for the school\u2019s Adventures In Engineering program. The final wipebook product \u201cfeel\u201d was heavily influenced by his laid-back, easy-going attitude. Team Wipebook really hopes that you can enjoy the smooth flow of the marker on the wipebook's pages as much as he does.\nThe Strategist: Thomas Sychterz\nA hard to win-over skeptic, Thomas initially brushed off the wipebook's utility and product appeal. This perception changed quickly when he couldn\u2019t stop using the prototype Frank lent him, to the point where Thomas became slightly annoyed when Frank wanted it back to lend to others. He\u2019s back in Montreal after having graduated from the Engineering Management program at U of O this spring, and hopes to make a wipebook splash in the \u201cR\u00e9gion M\u00e9tropolitaine\u201d using his pedal to the metal approach.\nThe Wise Man: Toby Maurice\nEvery successful life venture needs a sagacious, experienced old man at some point or another, to come into the picture and provide intangibly powerful advice. Unfortunately, Toby\u2019s cousin wasn\u2019t available to help us out with that role, so we had to settle for the \"patent pending,\" Professional Engineer/Project Manager. He\u2019ll do just fine though, bringing his wealth of knowledge and experience to the wipebook table. It\u2019s worth mentioning that his daughter, Elsie, has dibs on Thomas\u2019 wipebook shares, bearing he dies driving through a snowstorm. \nTesting the Wipebook:\nWill the ink smudge between the pages, and whats the difference between a correctable and dry erase markers?\n Here is a scrub test to see what happens when the book is scrubbed between the pages:\n In summary, the book works pretty well to keep all your ideas in one place. The only time where things have erased for me was when I accidentally put a written surface against my pant leg while I was writing on it, and my pants acted like an eraser. Also, using dry erase markers makes it more likely that you will accidentally erase your pages, so we suggest a correctable!\nAlso for those who want to know if the book can be scanned:\n For those who want to know what markers can be used on he wipebook 2.0:\n For those who wanted to know how fast it takes to unbind and rebind the spiral binding, here is a little video:\n I also got a very cool request: Can you print on a Wipebook sheet?\n Yes but there are some limitations as indicated in this video: \n Also if you want to know how long the ink can stay on the pages before getting hard to erase, check this video out:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk with the Wipebook is with the consistency of the gloss. When making past batches, we've noticed slight differences in the material from order to order. Luckily, we've been able to resolve this issue, but it is uncertain if similar issues will arise with the new supply chain of Wipebook 2.0. However, we are committed to offering the product as advertised, so our worse case scenario is that it takes us longer to deliver on Wipebook 2.0 until we mass produce a version that is identical to our prototype.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Free Correctable Pen Holders!", "update_content": "Hi everyone! \nIn order to promote our newest Kickstarter campaign for our brand new WipeCharts (click here for more info), we are sharing with all of you our 3D printed pen holders for your wipebooks.\nYou can download it here"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "A small gift if you help us!", "update_content": "Many of you mentioned that I forgot to include the survey link in the last update.

We experience poor posture and back pains, lost items, heat on our laps, and an overall slow work speed. We searched through one retail store after another, but much to our dismay, we only found basic accessories and plain-old surfaces for our laptops. So, the invention of the Slate was born. It's the only product of it's kind and with your help - we can make it affordable for everyone to enjoy.\nObsessive Attention to Detail\nThe Slate is cut from a block of pure, premium bamboo. It's ultra lightweight, super strong, and it will absorb the heat from your laptop. The curves, air ventilation, and docking station are chiseled, hand-sanded, and polished to mirror the feeling of glass. A super thick and heavy duty mouse pad is installed and sits flush against the surface of the slate.\nIt's Quicker and Smarter\nThe Slate is a household accessory, bringing form and function to our daily lives. It's practical, aesthetically pleasing, and most importantly - it increases the efficiency of our laptops. Save time with the Slate and work smarter, not harder. \nHeat Protection\nComfort should include temperature control but laptops release continual heat. The Slate's ventilation cools down our laptops. Any of the remaining heat is absorbed within the natural bamboo.\nThe Perfect Posture\nThe Slate is a promoter of healthy posture. The mousepad balances to the right and the laptop is centered, facing our bodies. It's just like using a desk but the Slate can be used in comfortable environments.\nPhone and Tablet Display\nThe Slate couldn't be considered the Mobile LapDesk without an extended display dock for our phones and mini tablets. The dock includes a cable slot and it can fit just about any phone or mini tablet on the market. \nMade for Lefty's and Righty's\nThanks to all the backers so far, we have well cleared our $10,000 stretch goal. So, the final production run will now include left handed and right handed Slates. After funding has completed - every backer will receive a survey. The survey will ask what type of Slate you would like, and you will be able to note your preference (left or right). Again, thanks everyone for making this possible!\nWe Need Your Help: The Slate will begin its first of many production runs. The PO's have been prepared for bulk orders of premium bamboo and commercial mouse pads. With your help, we will be able to purchase the materials and implement a streamlined production process - so the Slate can become affordable for the every day person. \nThe entire production process is completed at our workshop in Tempe, Arizona (USA). First, with a fine bit, the bamboo block will be cut by a CNC machine. Then, we will machine sand and smooth the Slate's surface and sides. We follow this step with a fine polish and the installation of the heavy-duty mousepad. We truly thank everyone participating in the early stages of this retail product.\nShipping and Delivery Time: The Slate will be shipped for free within the Domestic USA and World-Wide for an additional fee. To ensure an even quicker delivery time - once our goal has been met, we will begin ordering material and start the production run. We promise to all of our Kickstarter friends that the Slate will deliver in-time for Christmas. The Slate will be delivered 1-week before Christmas. Please Note: There will be a 1 to 2 week extended delivery times for international shipments.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point, we've overcome many challenges to create the Slate prototypes. With great pleasure, I can now confidently offer the finished and polished product to you on Kickstarter.\n\nKickstarter pledges will be fulfilled in the order they were placed so depending on the success of Slate, time will be our biggest challenge. Understanding this, we\u2019ve allocated extra time in our schedule to ensure that we can ship two weeks before Christmas so the Slate arrives a week early.\n\nWhile I know it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll encounter other challenges, we\u2019re fully committed to the Slate and I truly appreciate each backer making this retail product a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "A lapdesk just for gamers!", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nJust wanted to share iSkelter's latest project in case you missed it!\nCheck it out here: http://kck.st/1En55IP"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Check out Game Ply!", "update_content": "A good friend of ours just launched GamePly.

Where did the idea come from? Well, My wife, Gal and I, like most people today, are dependent on our smart phones but both are very aware of the dangers of driving while being on our phones. Gal surprised me one day and got me a phone mount for our car so that my phone would stay in place and be visible to me while I drive. However, as an industrial designer it is important to me that the gadgets I own are not only easy to use and versatile, but look good too. The phone mount she got me was bulky and difficult to set up, plus, once I got out of my car and went to where I had to go I was left with no mount for my phone.\nAfter doing some research on phone mounts that exist in today's market, I found that they were not easy to use, and lacked in design. Also, none of them gave you the option of easily taking them out of your car and traveling with you from place to place so that you will always have somewhere to mount your phone.\nSo we try to think of a solution for a phone mount that is simple and can travel with you everywhere you go.\nWe have spent the past 7 month developing, designing, and testing many different prototypes of Sticko. Testing out different materials, different sizes and different designs until we found the perfect combination so that Sticko will be simple, strong and look cool in all its uses, especially when connected to your smart phone.   \nBrain storming\nFinally, Sticko was born! A gadget that is small in size but big in its benefits:\nPLAY\n\nSticko colors\nSticko can attach to any smooth surface and is flexible due to the suction cup material its made out of. Its flexibility allows for Sticko to attach to smooth surfaces that are not necessarily flat. Sticko is made out of a special u.v protected and heatproof material so it will stay strong even in the harshest conditions like a hot car in the middle of summer. It weighs less than 5 grams and is less than 14 millimeters high.\nIt comes with a lobster clamp and earphone jack attached to it. You can attach it to your phone using the earphone jack or your key chain with the lobster clamp. Its size and flexibility allows you to slip it in your back pocket attached to your phone/or key chain.\nAttach Sticko to your keys\nUse Sticko as a phone stand\nSince we made Sticko we both are addicted to it, we have ours attached to our phones and key chains so our Sticko's are constantly in use. The more we use Sticko the more uses we find for it that go way beyond just mounting your smartphone. Every person who saw Sticko added their own twist on uses they thought fit for the little gadget. That's when we realized that people were as amazed and excited about Sticko as we were.\nUse Sticko as a Glasses Holder\nSoon enough our friends and family were asking us for a Sticko of their own. We ordered a small injection mold allowing us to test the final product, and, to give Sticko\u2019s to our friends and family and get their feedback.\nSo Where Do We Stand Now?\nThe Sticko's that came back from the injection mold came out perfect, and the feedback we received from those who got to use Sticko was overwhelmingly positive. So we wanted to make them on a larger scale so more people can enjoy Sticko. And that's what brought us to you, to Kickstarter.\nWhats Next?\nWith the funds we raise we will be able to invest in a larger production line so that we can share Sticko with you and anyone else who believes in this gadget. We have the final CAD technical drawings of Sticko that we can take to any manufacturer, but since we have already verified the quality and accuracy of the particular manufacturer who built the prototypes , we plan on having Sticko produced by them. They can accommodate small production quantity as well as very large mass production requirements. Once we finish our Kickstarter campaign, we will know exactly how many Sticko's we will need to produce. We will personally inspect each Sticko to make sure it is up to our highest standards. After they pass our quality control we will pack them securely and prepare for shipment. We already have business account with one of the most trusted shipping companies in the U.S. so we will ship Sticko to you A.S.A.P. Sticko will be FREE OF SHIPPING CHARGES anywhere within the U.S.\nWe are asking for your support so we can share the Sticko lifestyle with you and all your friends and all their friends, you get the point. Your help will allow us to build up a production line. That way we will be able to produce more Sticko's for every gadget that needs mounting.\nThanks for your support!\nOh one more thing, after you get a Sticko, send us pictures of cool and unique uses you think that we would love, so we can share them on Sticko's website and create a real Sticko community.\n Love, \n          Gal&Boaz\nCan I help in other ways? \nYes!

Its been over half a year of designing and testing Sticko but we wanted to make sure that Sticko is complete with rigorous performance and durability tests before we launch our Sticko in Kickstarter. Once we got the parts we assembled them by hand and gave it to more than 50 different users to test Sticko in different environments. The feedback we received gave us a lot of confidence that Sticko was ready. \nWe're very confident that we will deliver our products in superior quality by the projected dates.\n\nMANUFACTURING \nWe already have established a working relationship with a reliable plastic injection manufacturer and a mold maker, and an experienced contractor to mitigate the risk of delays by material suppliers and to ensure that quality control is implemented to the highest level. We have built test prototypes with our manufacturer and they fully understand our product, specifications and production timeline. While we know there can be unexpected challenges along the way. We will always be transparent and inform our backers of potential hurdles along the way.\n\nSHIP DATE \nWe have built in extra time for the manufacturing process and are confident we will ship by the projected dates. We will always keep you informed if things take longer than planned.\n\nPRODUCT \nWe have taken the following steps to ensure that we deliver the best quality product: \n- Built over many working prototypes with the established contract manufacturer. \n- Extensively tested Sticko for performance and durability. (by more than 100 different users that are using Sticko right now.)\n-We preformed an assembly and packaging test run so we know exactly how long it takes.\n-We will also refine our packaging.

They all said the same thing: \"Our customers don\u2019t care about domestically produced products.\" We call bullsh*t, but we need your help to prove them wrong.\n Let's give American Manufacturing its own yellow ribbon... a wearable way to show your support for the war they're fighting daily.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Bluelace itself: We asked one of America's very last shoelace manufacturers to produce the very best shoelace they'd ever made. \nAdding extra pressure to the pot, we promised them that if they could develop something truly impressive, it had the potential to become more than just a simple shoelace; it could become a symbol! \nAnd this symbol could do more than just help their business, it could help break the ongoing cycle of outsourcing, offshoring, and making things cheaper, faster and worse. It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story? Send us an email with your story idea(s) and if it's a story that fits the bill (and we have the # of backers to do it! ) we'll send our high-end video production team around the country to capture the best of best. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur 10-Year Hoodie project taught us that making a great product in a bunch of colors and sizes can get pretty complicated.

They travel from Australia to Hawaii, California, Mexico and the Galapagos Islands to speak with people from all corners of the surfing community, from former world champions through to everyday surfers. Stories of fear, isolation and self-doubt emerge alongside ones of hope, self-empowerment and transformation. As their journey unfolds, Thomas and David  are inspired to promote change within the existing culture by looking to surfing\u2019s grassroots values of freedom of spirit, open-mindedness and love for the ocean.\nWant to read more?

Because of her evangelical background, she was given unprecedented access to film inside this school over the course of a summer. But, as she began to film, she discovered the shocking truth of what was really going on at this remote reform school.\nThroughout her time there, she follows the stories of several American teenagers who were taken from their homes and sent away to the Dominican Republic be \"fixed\" for problems ranging from sexual orientation, to having panic attacks, to drug abuse.\nStudents emptying water from a trash pit as a punishment\nDavid, a 17-year old from Colorado, was taken in the middle of the night after coming out to his parents, and shipped off to be reprogrammed into a straight, born-again Christian. Tai, a 16-year-old Haitian-American girl from Boston, was sent away after acting out and experimenting with drugs as a result of childhood traumas. Beth, a 15-year old from Michigan, suffered from a debilitating anxiety disorder, and her parents were desperate to help her finish high school. \nWhile in \u201cthe program\u201d students were totally isolated, with little to no contact with the outside world, until Kate arrived with her camera. One brave student asked for her help to get free, and the ensuing struggles to secure his freedom revealed just how far this school would go to prevent their students from leaving. \nKidnapped for Christ is directed by Kate S. Logan and produced by Yada Zamora, Kate S. Logan and Paul A. Levin for RedThorn Productions. Executive Producers include Lance Bass (\u2018NSYNC), Mike C. Manning (Disney\u2019s \u201cCloud 9\u201d) and Tom DeSanto (\u201cTransformers,\u201d \u201cX-Men\u201d). \nHelp us finish the film in time for our premiere in January at the Slamdance Film Festival!\nKidnapped For Christ is set to premiere this January at the Slamdance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.\nOf 5,000 total films submitted, only 8 documentaries were chosen and Kidnapped For Christ was one of them. Help us make sure it\u2019s the best film it can be by the time we premiere in just a month!\nWhy is this film important?\nThis film addresses an issue that very few Americans are aware of, but that has impacted the lives of millions of adolescents and families for nearly half a century \u2013 the rise of inappropriate and abusive treatment in the troubled teen industry. All over the US and abroad, so-called therapeutic boarding schools, boot camps, and wilderness rehabilitation programs take in teenagers with a wide range of issues and use unsafe and often harmful tactics to reform them. Using political connections, religious affiliations, and substantial amounts of money, many such camps and schools have committed inappropriate and abusive acts behind their guarded walls for decades with impunity.\nFew journalists or law enforcement agencies have investigated the considerable number of abuse allegations and even deaths arising from these types of programs. No one has been able to comprehensively document on film what goes on behind closed gates at any of these institutions \u2013 until now. \nKidnapped for Christ tells the stories of students who were sent to an institution that resembles countless others around the world, so that these teens may make people aware of the danger these programs pose to our youth. \nThere are thousands of unregulated \"troubled teen\" programs where parents can send their children for any reason they wish.\nA few facts:\nForbes magazine estimates that the \"troubled teen\" industry is worth over 2 billion dollars. \nSince the 1970s at least 157 American teens have died in behavior modification programs. \nNo troubled teen programs are subject to federal regulation, most are not monitored by any government agency. \nIt\u2019s completely legal for a parent in the US to hire people to kidnapped their child and take them away to an unregulated institution where many have reported instances of physical, sexual, and physiological abuse.  \nWhat we need\nThis film has been a passion project for everyone on our team, and now we need your passion and support to take us through the home stretch so we'll be ready for Slamdance in a month.\nHere's the breakdown of where the money will be spent:\n$5,000 - Sound Mix\n$5,000 - Errors and Omissions insurance (critical for distribution)\n$10,000 - Music composition and recording\n$5,000 - Transfers to HDCam and BluRay (for the festival), up-res to HD, end credits, and other essential post services to get the film ready to screen at Slamdance. \nThese are really the bare-bones costs we NEED to have before we premiere in January. \nSince our last fund-raising campaigns we have been able to complete the remaining interviews and shoots, finish editing the film, and get most of our graphics done. We\u2019re 90% of the way there! Now we need to finish the last 10% of the work on the film so we can bring it to the largest audience possible. \nDonate now and you can receive some of our rewards before Christmas! \nLooking for a unique holiday present?

We have spent the last 18 months listening to our backers and the community, to what they wanted most out of a portable speaker. You asked for this and here we have it, welcome HiddenRadio2!\n\nTIMELESS DESIGN, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY\nThe new design is a natural evolution and, again, amazingly simple. All visual distractions have been removed to make everything about your music.\n\nIt may look similar on the outside, but under the hood it has been completely re-engineered. To deliver \u2018best in class\u2019 sound, we completely reinvented the speakers inside, fine tuning and optimizing them for our design and unique form factor.\nUNBELIEVABLY POWERFUL, IN A COMPACT FORM\nWhile big speakers typically deliver great bass but poor high frequencies, and smaller speakers tend to give great highs but no bass, our proprietary neodymium dual speaker system combined with our custom software allows for amazing highs and deep, powerful lows. With new engineering solutions, we\u2019ve also managed to more than double the speaker chamber, delivering even deeper bass. Once you hear it, you will need to remind yourself how small and portable the HiddenRadio2 actually is.\nWE ADDED MULTI SPEAKER BLUETOOTH\nWe finally made it! After almost two years of listening to the many requests and undertaking a lot of research, we are thrilled to introduce our MultiPoint feature. This means that you can link two HiddenRadio2\u2019s to one phone and create a wireless audio set-up for your home, easier than ever before. Place the speakers in different areas for a seamless sound experience, or set up two speakers alongside your iPad or computer to create an incredible portable stereo.\nMAGIC LIFT TECHNOLOGY\nSimply touch the cap or hit play on your phone, and the cap magically lifts, revealing the speaker hidden beneath, as your HiddenRadio2 begins to stream crystal clear music in 360-degree sound. Not only does the elevating cap provide protection from the elements, it also creates a larger bass chamber that delivers deeper bass than ever before.\nINTELLIGENT TOUCH CONTROLS\nUsing an intelligent capacitive touch sensor in the cap, you can operate your music directly from the HiddenRadio2. By simply tapping the cap, you can play, pause, adjust the volume, skip forward or back, fast forward or rewind, answer a phone call, or even activate Siri!\nIT\u2019S ALSO A SPEAKERPHONE\nReceiving a phone call? Touch the cap and the HiddenRadio2 turns into an incredible speakerphone. We\u2019ve added top-of-the-line noise cancelling microphones to make your call sound even better.\nWE ADDED NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATION (NFC)\nThe intelligent cap sensor also uses NFC, meaning you can instantly sync your HiddenRadio2 with an NFC-enabled phone. With more and more devices featuring NFC, you will be more future-proof than ever.\nWE\u2019VE REINVENTED THE SPEAKER\nMost speaker companies use off-the-shelf speakers and repackage them in a different box. This type of cookie cutter design and functionality means that you will never have a speaker that is perfectly tuned or optimized for your needs. For this reason, we have redesigned the speaker itself. Using extensive research, we have built custom speaker drivers from the highest-quality materials, previously only used in large expensive sound systems.\n\nSUPERIOR SOUND\nHiddenRadio2\u2019s unique speaker drivers and cone design spread the sound evenly throughout the room for a full, 360-degree audio experience over 90dB.\nHere is a direct comparison with one of the market leaders, the Mini Jambox, while playing a range of music styles.\nAnd here are the frequency response curves of the HiddenRadio2 compared to some of the market leaders today.\nFUTURE-PROOF\nWe have made the HiddenRadio2 the most advanced speaker on the market. To do this we have created the most advanced feature set of any compact speaker on the market.\nTHE HIDDENRADIO2 STORY\nSince our original HiddenRadio Kickstarter, we\u2019ve continuously asked our backers and the community one question: what do you most desire from a portable speaker?\nWe listened to all of our community\u2019s feedback and worked tirelessly to make the HiddenRadio2 simply the best wireless speaker ever.\n\nWorking with the feedback from the community, we then started brainstorming and sketching on what the new speaker could look like, and how it would function. Moving components around is a little like a compact game of Tetris, where moving one part affects all the others.\nSome of our initial sketches\nTo learn how it would function in the real world we then set about creating prototypes. This process begins with creating 3D models and 3D printing them. We then glued in speakers in different combinations to find out what is the best configuration to deliver the best sound.\nEarly sound prototypes\nOnce we had a basic idea of the prototype design we then started integrating the concept with our research and development team to get the design ready for something that can be produced with our partners.\nCAD model\nThe last step was refining all the parts and creating full working prototypes with all the necessary finishes to provide complete proof of concept.\nFinal working prototypes\nIn our current state we have complete proof of concept and are now integrating the design with our factory in order to create the injection tools needed to manufacture the speaker.\n\nNEXT STEPS\nWe\u2019ve just completed product development and testing, and we are now ready for production. We need your help to build the molds, get certifications and make this truly unique, yet timeless, product a reality!\n\u2022    $61k: Injection molding tools\n\u2022    $40k: Bluetooth and international safety certifications\n\nONLY THE BEST QUALITY\nThe HiddenRadio team has been working in the consumer electronics industry with global corporations for more than 15 years, and we have deep experience bringing amazing, successful products to market; we have also learned a great deal from the original HiddenRadio experience. We will be implementing a new, world-class manufacturing process with our partners - who for over 30 years have delivered high quality audio products for Fortune 100 companies like Apple, Philips, Hitachi and many more - to help drive consistent quality and customer satisfaction. We have already invested 18 months of research to ensure the very best components and the most innovative, efficient design.\n\nOn top of this, we are also working with a global engineering consultancy in Hong Kong to help manage manufacturing and deliver the highest quality products, which we then test, one by one, with a 3rd party testing house to ensure each product passes a high set of stringent standards.\n\nBE A PART OF THIS GREAT PROJECT\nThe HiddenRadio2 is the clear and simple answer to both unobtrusive home decor and absolute sound quality. We can\u2019t wait to share this great project with you. When you see the HiddenRadio2 on your own shelf, and the shelves of retails stores - you will know that YOU helped make it happen!\n\nThank you for stopping by - we hope you enjoy our new project as much as we do!\nJohn + Vitor\n\nPRODUCTION PLAN", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHiddenRadio2 is an exciting yet complex product. It involves a deep understanding of mechanical, electrical and RF design. Before coming to Kickstarter we have completed the product development, and submitted our design to all significant quality and performance tests through numerous prototypes.\n\nThe point we find ourselves now is a fully tested and prototyped design, ready for manufacturing. If the project becomes successful we will then proceed with the tooling in order to go from prototype to mass production.\n\nNaturally there will always be risks in any venture; but by implementing production safeguards and conducing a high level of research, we\u2019ve dramatically reduced these risks.

Our patterns enhance any figures torso which gives you a bold look. We need your help to bring our concept to reality. The final colors will be black and white.\n2.) Hydrophobic Fabric: The fabric has a nanotechnology bonded to the fibers on the microscopic level.

On the go.\n1 Voice Beanie Features:\n1) Convenience and comfort: No more ear buds constantly falling out of your ears, or worse, giving you an earache. No more dangling wires.\n2) Superior audio quality: Sound disks and our Bluetooth receivers are built right into the beanie for unbelievable sound quality.\n3) Warmth: The beanie is made of a tight knit to keep you toasty on a chilly day.\n4) Style: Look good as you enjoy your favorite tunes while going for a run, commuting to work, or hitting the slopes. \nThe 1 Voice Story:\n1 Voice was started by fashion industry veteran and avid runner and skier, Girish Karnani. Girish was frustrated dealing with his ear buds constantly falling out of his ears while being active, along with the earache he would get when he wore them under his beanie for an extended period of time. His frustration led to the birth of the 1 Voice Beanie.\nGirish decided that with Bluetooth technology so easily accessible in everyday life, there was no reason why there should not be a winter beanie with built-in wireless headphones. He used his fashion expertise and contacts to develop a warm, comfortable, stylish beanie. He then partnered up with Bluetooth audio experts to identify sound disks that can be sewn into the beanie directly over your ears. Then, they sourced a Bluetooth controller that is sewn onto the back of the beanie so that anyone can listen to their favorite music while running, skiing, or just walking to work.\nHow The 1 Voice Beanie Works:\nThe 1 Voice Beanie is simple to use. It connects with any Bluetooth enabled phone or audio device. Once paired, you can play, pause, and control your track and volume directly from your phone.The beanie has a built-in battery that allows for 6-8 hours of continuous playback, and is easily recharged with the USB charging cable that is included with the beanie.\n1 Voice Beanie Demo:\nPLAY\n\nSizing And Style:\nThe 1 Voice Beanie is unisex and one size fits all.\nThe Technology Behind The 1 Voice Beanie:\nWhile working on a consulting project, Girish was fortunate enough to meet Grace Tan, a Managing Partner at Langder Technology Co.,an Asia-based company. Langder has over 10 years of experience manufacturing audio equipment with an expertise in creating Bluetooth devices. Girish and Tan brainstormed ideas on how to optimize on both product design and sound quality.  They developed the basic product concept for a winter beanie with built-in wireless Bluetooth headphones.  They also determined a production method that would allow for quick and efficient production cycles.\nOnce the technology side was taken care of, Girish turned to one of his long time business partners, Kenny He, the owner of Shaoxing Soya Manufacturing, to work on the actual beanie production.  The goal was to manufacture a beanie warm and comfortable enough to house the Bluetooth receiver and sound disks.\n  Girish sent this basic sketch to both Kenny and Grace and with some careful collaboration, the 1 Voice Beanie came to life.\nMy Masterpiece\n\nThe initial challenge was to create sounds disks, a battery, and a Bluetooth receiver that were small enough to be housed in the beanie so our customers would not notice them. What we needed was smaller than industry standards. Our first prototype came out near perfect, except for 3 problems:\nInitial Prototype\n1) The actual beanie was too big -  This was an easy fix, and we changed our specs to match some of the more popular beanies in the market. \n2) The sound disks moved around too much - We initially stitched down the area around the sound disk, but not completely. As a result, the disk would fall out of place and slide around between the two layers of the beanie. We thought to completely stitch down the area around the sound disk, but we knew that people would like the flexibility of having the sounds disks movable so they can position them over their ears. What we decided on was to stitch down and close off a small area around the disks so our beanie customer can move them to the left and right about 1.5 inches and up and down 0.5 inches.\nActual 1 Voice Beanie - Sound Disk Location\nActual 1 Voice Beanie Sounds Disks And Receiver\n3) The Bluetooth receiver was too big and too visually unappealing - The key to fixing the size problem was attaching a small lithium ion battery to the back of the receiver chip. Even though the battery is tiny, it allows for 6-8 hours of continuous music playback. We changed the receiver color to a solid black to blend into the beanie better.\nActual 1 Voice Beanie Receiver\nManufacturing And Distribution Plan:\nOver the last few months we have been able to perfect every step in the manufacturing process and we are ready for production. Our manufacturing partners have sourced all the raw materials, and have promised a turn-around time of less than a week.\nUsing relationships built through Girish\u2019s fashion brand, Girish has been able to negotiate steeply discounted air freight rates so transit time from Asia to New Jersey will only be 2-3 days.\n1 Voice has partnered with Alpi Logistics, a 3rd Party Logistics warehouse located in central NJ, to manage the warehousing and shipping of the beanies. Alpi guarantees a 24 hour turn-around time once orders are submitted to them.\nAlpi Logistics\nWe are extremely confident that the 1 Voice supply chain is set up efficiently, and we are even more confident that if funded, we will be able to ship out the 1 Voice Beanies to our backers in time for the holidays.\nHelp Get 1 Voice Started:\nOver the last few months, the 1 Voice team has worked hard to get the beanie designed, manufacturing up and running, our distribution warehouses in place, and our marketing team built. We have even been able to create sales partnerships so that the beanie can be distributed as soon as it is in stock. Now it is time to place our bulk production order, and get 1 Voice launched. The $5000 we hope to raise will do just that. Please support us at whatever level you're comfortable with.

It's brilliant! It's beautiful! Seriously it's perfect! Wow. So impressed right now. \u201d  \n\u201cI've been trying to haphazardly create something like this for myself and I could never quite put my finger on what I needed.\u201d  \n\u201cIt's really genius!\u201d \nHi I'm Dani! As a busy mom and a blogger I have a lot on my plate everyday. So having a day planner and checklists are super important for me to stay organized in all areas of my life...and especially for my blog. \nI felt like Goldilocks\u2026\u2026this ones spaces were too small, this one didn\u2019t have a weekly planner, this one didn\u2019t have room for notes. You get the idea. So my life was a mess of spiral notebooks, sticky notes, slips of paper and great ideas scribbled onto backs of envelopes.\nMy blog started to grow but I was so disorganized that half the time I couldn\u2019t even remember where I had stopped on a post when I went to pick it back up.\nOnce we had our second baby I knew something had to change or I was going to have to stop blogging\u2026.and thus the Blog Buddy was born.\nAfter months of research and development, well over 300 hours of work and too many trees to count I am proud to present to you what I firmly believe to be the best business planner for bloggers on the market today! \n ***All Sheets other than Monthly Calendars are UNDATED for a full year of use***\nYearly, monthly and weekly goal setting. \nWeekly Planner with ample room for appointments, Post Info/Social Media, and Tasks \nA FULL 24 Month Calendar! (January 2014-December 2015)\n2 Page Spread Monthly Calendars (finally no tiny useless squares!) \nGuided To-Do Lists and Blank Notes pages \nPost Completion Checklists (track multiple posts completion at a glance) \nReviews & Giveaway Tracker \nGuest Blogging Opportunity Tracker (track posts pitched, written, published, etc) \nPotential Advertiser Tracker (track contact and follow up dates easily) \nCurrent Advertiser Tracker (track rates and renewal dates) \nBlog Statistics (compare a year at a glance for all statistics you want to track) \nMonthly Expenses (keep track each and every receipt!)\nRevenue & Expense overviews (compare a year at a glance for revenue & expenses) \nQuarterly Balance Sheet with Estimated Tax Payments (see your finances at a glance) \n Click below to view a flip through the interior of the planner!\nPlease note: back cover is now blank and does not contain our logo as shown in preview. This is your planner not ours!\nThese are the spreadsheets I use to keep organized:\nRevenue & Expense Receipt Tracker (individual entry for receipts/payments for tax purposes in case you prefer digital) \nImportant Contact Tracker (track influential contacts and consistently interact with them) \nSocial Media Tracker (organize your social media schedule)\nThe contents are super important but the actual design of the binder has been incredibly important to us as well.  \nBINDING: The binding is a heavy duty Double O Wire Binding.\nWhich allows it to be used completely opened:\nor folded in half for a single page.  \nSOFT TOUCH LAMINATED COVER: The cover is a heavy duty chipboard that is hand wrapped with a beautiful natural feel paper which is coated in a soft touch laminate. We wanted something that would protect the cover from inevitable spills but we hate that fake plastic feeling of traditional laminate. \nWe are so pleased with the durability and feel of the cover!\nI've dropped salsa on it, smeared dirt all over it and even drawn art on it in hot sauce and it has performed beautifully! \nThe covers rigidity provides a perfectly hard writing surface for one handed writing, or using the binder on your lap. It feels amazing in your hands!\nOVERSIZED COVER: We wanted to be able to tuck pieces of loose paper into the binder and elastic band it closed securely. After testing our original prototype we realized that full sized sheets of paper stuck out about 1/4 of an inch which resulted in mashed edges of the paper. The tabs would have also stuck out resulting in having them pressed into your hand should you carry it on end.\nSo we opted for an oversized cover. It allows full size sheets of paper to be carried without being damaged and allows you to carry it on end without having tabs gouging your hand.\nELASTIC STRAP: We have included a built in riveted elastic strap (no misplacing this one!) that securely holds the binder and any extra papers you tuck inside together. This is heavy duty elastic that should withstand lots of repeated use without undue stretching.\nINTERIOR PAGES: The interior pages are printed on professional quality 60lb matte paper which provides a nice weight for two sided writing and limits show through. Normal copy paper is 24lb paper for reference. \nTABS: There are 6 heavy duty poly plastic tab dividers. They are a solid sheet of poly from binding to tab so they will not rip with wear. Our manufacturer hasn't produced them for us yet(machine costs) but we have samples of the poly in hand and a photo of what they will look like:\nZIPPERED POCKET: A full size heavy duty zippered pocket with lay flat zipper enclosure! \n*****Zipper strip will be white not red in final binders*****\nUse it to easily and securely keep receipts, business cards (yours and others) or even tuck in your ID/Debit card when you don't want to carry a full purse. \nMOVABLE ERASABLE BOOKMARK: Each planner come with one white plastic bookmark with space for writing your yearly and monthly goals and things you are grateful for. It is movable so you can easily find your place for the week. \nERASABLE/PERMANENT PEN: Each binder also comes with a Staedtler Permanent Lumocolor Pen that is used for writing on the bookmark and can be used on the tab pages as well. \nThese pens dry almost instantaneously and are waterproof & smudge proof. They are used extensively by the military and Forest Service for writing on laminated maps. \nBut they are easily removed with basic rubbing alcohol or my favorite a bit of fingernail polish remover!\nINTERIOR COVER POCKET: We have an awesome pocket on the interior front cover to keep bills and papers securely handy. \nPRODUCED 100% IN THE USA: It's been said before but it's worth noting again that this product is produced entirely in the USA . We could have outsourced this project easily to China (and made a ton more money), but it is very important to us to try to keep our business local. \nThese products cost almost 4x as much as a standard $30 Walmart/Target planner costs to make. We are charging as little as we possibly can to cover our costs and bring you this life changing high quality business tool.\nPlease keep this in mind as you choose which planner to purchase this year!\nShipping update: February is our end goal...but as soon as we are fully funded we can have our manufacturer start printing which will expedite their arrival to you! So please back and share as soon as you can :) \nWe unfortunately will not be able to get these to you by Christmas. But we have made you an awesome card you can print for your loved ones for a Christmas gift letting them know they will be receiving their very own Blog Buddy!\nInternational shipping is a huge issue with a product that is this heavy. We are actively working on solutions for this with a drop shipper and will be opening it for international orders if at all possible. Please pledge $1 if you would like to stay updated through the project on when international shipping opens. \nIf you are in Canada and want it regardless of cost our current rate is cost of Blog Buddy + $30 for shipping. We will extend the $50 early bird rate to anyone who is buying in Canada for the Kickstarter duration to help ease the cost!\nComing very very soon!

Its because of the unpack.  \nWe brainstormed a new way to pack - a way where you will never have to unpack again.\nMeet Rolo\nRolo seperates your clothing into clear transparent mesh sections. Your clothing will stay where you left it, wherever you go.\nThe attached hanging hook allows you to hang it up at your destination.  Rolo becomes a portable wardrobe, giving immediate access to exactly what you want. \nNo more digging in bags, no more pulling everything out to find something.  Its all right here in front of you.  When you want to leave you can simply roll it up and go.\nRolo was engineered to keep your clothing flat maximizing storage space, and minimizing wrinkled garments.\nWhen it is rolled up Rolo is the exact same size as a bedroll, allowing you to store your clothing on the outside of your backpack.  This frees up the inside of the backpack for other things.  \nWe wanted to make it versatile.  Hang it, attach it to backpack, or put it inside a rolling suitcase; Rolo will keep everything organized wherever you go.\nThe Story of Rolo\nWe were backpacking in Europe and we stumbled upon this really neat toiletry organizer for keeping your soaps and toothpaste together. \nThis little organizer soon helped us organize our phone cords, medicines, and all of the little junk that used to be all over our backpack.  There had to be something like this for clothing - right? \nAfter searching everywhere, and even running a patent search we turned up nothing.  Nope, not one. \nCheryl made our first prototype with materials from the local fabric store. With some hard work and a little time we had a real working design.   \nWe found a local manufacturer right here in San Francisco, they want to help us, but to meet the minimum order requirements we need your help.\nYour pledge will help us create the first official production run of Rolo travel bags.  You can help make this dream a reality. Be the first to have this new travel accessory and have more time to experience the pleasures of travel.\nMade in America\nWe found an awesome manufacturer based right here in San Francisco. \nThis picture was taken 10 minutes from the manufacturers office.  We know we can produce the best quality when we make it locally and we won't settle for anything but the best.\nRolo is going to be made out of high quality ballistic nylon or Cordura brand fabric.  It is lightweight and strong.  The mesh is high quality nylon hex mesh and we are working closely with the manufacturer to ensure durability.  The zippers are YKK brand and everything is manufactured in America.\nOur Production Plan\nRolo is following the common business plan as laid out in South Park:\nStep 1. Collect Underpants!\nStep 2. ?\nStep 3. Profit!\nWell, its actually a little bit more complicated than that -\nYour donations will help us purchase our first production batch of travel bags from a manufacturer here in San Francisco.  They have informed us that they can begin manufacturer as early as January or February 2014.  The manufacture process will take 4 to 6 weeks, and then we will rent a warehouse and have the product shipped there. We will then visit the warehouse for a quality inspection.  If everything is good, we will give them to a shipping company who will send them all over the world. \nInternational shipping is a challenge.  Even though Rolo weighs 1 pound, and has dimensions of 17 inches by 3 inches by 3 inches it will still cost around $30 to send it to Europe.  We are searching for creative solutions to curb this cost - there might even be a way to send a large shipment there first and then distribute locally.  If anyone has any neat ideas please send them along! \nYour donation is the spark that will ignite this dream.  We really hope you join us.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have developed a thorough plan for fulfillment. Our manufacturer is local and will source the materials. We have a price quote, materials selected and their continual support. We have a shipping company standing by ready to ship the finished product out to everyone. We are still working out a RMA strategy, and will be available via email to answer any questions or concerns.\n\nRisks that we can foresee are possible material shortages, incorrect sample specifications, or other manufacturing setbacks. Shipping is also a complicated hurtle. There is Value Added Tax (VAT), customs duty fees, shipping costs, warehousing costs, and shipping costs - but a combination of quality research and an experienced shipping company will help us navigate this treacherous landscape. If there are shortages or shipping issues the worst thing that will happen is it will add additional time to the fulfillment period. We are committed to this, even if we have to eat additional cost to get it out the door.\n\nWe have a real working prototype, a company, a provisional patent, a trademark, and have taken all the necessary steps to ensure smooth execution of our plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Rolo II is a reality, and wouldn't be possible without your help!", "update_content": "Rolo II\nIt has been more than four years since we embarked on this glorious journey to create the first Rolo Travel Bag.

Each cookie is crafted with a caring hand, from its humble buttered beginning to the finishing stroke of a brush. Turning dreams into frosted paintings, Sogi\u2019s Honey Bakeshop says it sweeter.\n...And funnier. You saw the *real* Kickstarter video above. Here are the bloopers.\nPLAY\n\nNo, but seriously. What is this Sogi thing all about?\nSogi's Honey Bakeshop is a woman, some paintbrushes, and a whole lot of sugar and butter.\nOwner and creator, Sogoal Zolghadri--more lovingly known as \"Sogi,\" by family, friends, and local Starbucks baristas--is classically trained and practiced in both fine art and pastry decor. In 2010, she brought the two worlds together to create what is now a custom cookie confectionary: baked from scratch, hand painted, and delivered to doorsteps across the country. \nSogi has completed countless orders of cookies, from friends' weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, corporate events -- she even made an order of 300 custom cookies for Martha Stewart! (That was a doozy.)\nWhat is this Kickstarter campaign for?\nThis year, Sogi's dream of growing the bakeshop and making cookies for everyone has begun taking baby steps towards a promising future, receiving applause from the likes of Martha Stewart Weddings, Free People, and Nastygal. Neat!\nHowever, Sogi's Honey Bakeshop is still a one-woman show--in a 5'x5' kitchen with a struggling little mixer and counter space all too limited. Showtime begins after her 9-6 day gig and usually involves really bad, loud music. As fun as it sounds, the bakeshop would be even better with a little bit more dancing room.\nBut in order to keep growing, Sogi needs a bigger kitchen and the funding to sustain it. As of late, she's had to turn down orders due to limited space and materials. \nHeartbreaking? Duh. \nSolvable? Absolutely.\nSo now she's turning to Kickstarter -- turning to you -- for a chance to grow Sogi's Honey Bakeshop.\nIf Sogi can raise the money in this Kickstarter project, she'll be able to rent out commercial kitchen space and then do what she's always wanted to do: make custom cookies for everyone!\nThis sounds crazy cool. But tell me more about the cookies.\nThey're not just beautiful, they're delicious. Every batch is made entirely from scratch using simple, natural ingredients. Topped with classic royal icing, each cookie is then painted with food coloring and water (with the tiniest paintbrushes you've ever seen!)\nSound good?

I am over the moon about the response this book has generated and I promise the final project will be worthy of your generosity (of $$ + spirit)!  A Deep Bow to You All!  \nWe do have several Stretch Goals designed to reach more families and put a yoga practice into the hands of more children all over the country.  If we reach the Stretch Goal of $10,500 we will be able to:\nCreate the Good Night Yoga video and use it to help teach the sequence to kids in schools, afterschool programs and community centers around the country. (Also, ALL of you who have contributed to the creation of Good Night Yoga will have access to this beautiful instructional video.\nDonate copies of Good Night Yoga (and the instructional video) for use in schools and programs that support kids getting the academic and life skills they need (such as Head Start). \nVisit: Schools, Libraries and Community Programs to teach and share Good Night Yoga with young people and families. (We have a lot of requests coming in and this will make it possible!)\nGood Night Yoga teaches kids a flow of yoga poses and gives them their own yoga practice right in their hands!  This project comes directly out of the work I've done teaching yoga to kids for the past 15 years and to see it finally in book form is an absolute dream come true.\nOpening to the universe in star pose.\nGood Night Yoga is born out of my classes and is designed to teach:\nConfidence\nSelf Regulation \nSuccessful Transitions \nSelf Soothing \nFocus \nFlexibility\nCalm \nBalance \nCreativity \nGood Night Yoga offers a flow a child can practice alone or with an adult following the clear and vivid images and instructions.  The book also includes a Guided Relaxation section that can be used separately or as the relaxing end (savasana) to the yoga sequence.\nKids can go back to the parts they love, try them out, experiment and explore. \nChildren (ages 4-8) can experience the playful and expansive feeling of moving through a sequence of yoga poses.\nRelaxation\nIncluded in the book are guided relaxations to help children feel more relaxed, as they let go of their day and drift off to sleep, or at any point in the day. I have found with my own kids, and with kids I teach, that simply asking them to 'be calm' or to 'stop moving' does not really help them to experience relaxation. But, if those same kids are given a way to use their imaginations as a tool; they can literally transform their experience to one of deep rest.\nCalming Rituals\nAnd while this book is not exclusively for bedtime, I do love the way that that nature has its own rituals at the end of the day as animals settle in for the night, the air changes and the the stars come out. My hope is that this book and the ritual of the poses mirror the feeling of what is happening in the natural world.\nKids can experience their own yoga practice--anytime!\nImagination Coming to Life\nI searched high and low for Sarah Jane Hinder, the incredible illustrator on this project. Her illustrations bring the feeling of a yoga practice right off the page in a way that is nothing short of magical. All of her images are so inviting and colorful, they bring the practice to life and are the perfect expression of the Good Night Yoga flow. You can see more of her work on www.smogawoo.com \nSarah Jane Hinder's illustrations bring the experience of yoga right off the page!\nWhere will the money go?\nYour backing of this project will fund the process of taking this book from an idea to an actual product. There is so much more independence and creative license in producing the book this way (with your help!).\nHowever, in the age of self-publishing, the costs to create a high quality product include: illustrations, quality printing for the vivid images, professional formatting, layout and editing for the project through an online publishing company as well as purchasing the ISBN number so the book can find its way into even more kids hands. Your money will go to funding each of these critical steps to ensure the creation of the best possible yoga book for kids out there!\n8% will also go to Kickstarter and the processing fees.\nRewards\nThis could be your child-in the book!\nOK, now for the good stuff.

Good Night Yoga is one of our regular yoga flows taught in my classes and trainings.  It is such satisfying work, and the idea that more children everywhere could actually have their own yoga practice to explore through this book is a thrill I can't even put into words. I know that I will be able to get the book to countless kids and families through the many yoga studios and students out there who want it.

And yes, we're totally going out of the box with our first Kickstarter project. Not only are we doing a sequel to a homemade movie, but we're still out to prove that... everyone loves that LUMPIA!\nHere's our Kababayan Today segment that aired recently with host Jannelle So http://youtu.be/hVYJnuLiKgI?t=49s\nTHE ORIGINAL MOVIE\nNamed after the deep-fried Filipino dish, LUMPIA is a home made feature we shot in Daly City, CA with our neighborhood friends over a seven year span beginning in the summer of 1996. When it finally debuted in 2003, the film won over film festivals and community screenings, gaining itself a cult following. The home made movie even got noticed by Hollywood with a positive film review from VARIETY:\n\"Taking low-budget to new heights, LUMPIA is a youth project that got delightfully out of hand. \"\n                                                                -- Variety, January 14, 2004\nLUMPIA became the first of many collaborations between my Kid Heroes Productions company and Xylophone Films during the last decade, including high profile music videos with the Black Eyed Peas, and commercials for L&L Hawaiian BBQ, DIRECTV, and Lincoln.\n10 years later, we've come up with a fresh new story that has us and the original cast ECSTATIC! Reuniting the characters of Fogtown, LUMPIA 2 (Working title for now) is an action comedy sequel we're sure will excite the fans of the original movie, yet stand on its own and appeal to a whole new audience.\nTHE SEQUEL\n15 years after the events of the original, the LUMPIA-wielding avenger reappears in Fogtown to prevent an escalating drug war between Filipino factions. This causes more drama and comedic mayhem for MON MON, KELLY, JART, TYRONE and their old Fogtown High School counterparts who find themselves all reunited under unique circumstances for a wedding. \nKUYA in the opening scene of LUMPIA 2\nLUMPIA 2 is an action comedy, a mystery thriller, and a wedding movie mashed up all into one. A Filipino syndicate has united all the different street gangs, controlling all the underground activity of Fogtown. KUYA the Silent Avenger is on a mission to stop the flow of drugs infiltrating his old high school, and soon finds out the key to stopping them requires him to team up with the 2 most unlikeliest partners, former rivals TYRONE and MON MON. The problem is that MON MON has a wedding to go to and TYRONE isn't exactly acting like the TYRONE we know.\nA fed up Tyrone rallies his crew in the parking lot.\nConflict, romance, and FOB bashing dominated the first film. In this sequel, we get to see how these characters have grown after high school. The fun part for fans of the original is discovering what happened between MON MON and KELLY.  Does JART and COSTANCIO still have Karaoke Night?  The sequel will answer all the hard-hitting questions like... how does the SILENT AVENGER keep his LUMPIA fresh and restocked in the heat of battle?  And finally, we get to meet MON MON'S & COSTANCIO's parents... and sister!\nTHE CAST\nWhat's LUMPIA 2 without its original players? Most of the original cast will be returning including:\n\nFRANCIS CUSTODIO as JAMES/MON MON\nEDWARD BAON as TYRONE\nCARLOS BAON as KUYA\nELIZABETH TEODORO MENDOZA as KELLY\nplus MORE to be confirmed later!\n\nAnd this time, they'll be supported by a new set of characters created for the sequel. \n We'll be announcing more of the cast additions through campaign updates.\nTHE FILMMAKERS\nEditor/Producer A.J CALOMAY & Director PATRICIO GINELSA showcase the sequel's logo at Comic Con.\nDIRECTOR: PATRICIO GINELSA (\"Yup yup, that's me!\")\nhttp://www.patricioginelsa.com\n\nHere are 2 videos I directed that will inspire the tone and look of the LUMPIA sequel:\nSince we plan on shooting this in my hometown of DALY CITY, CA, I've recruited a BAY AREA team of LUMPIA-lovin' producers to collaborate with.\nPRODUCERS:\nDARRIEL GINELSA\nA.J. CALOMAY\nLEROID DAVID\nLILLIAN PRIJOLES\nLAWRENCE IRIARTE\nLISA CHONG\nLIke all of our projects, we'll strive to create a professional team that includes the community in front of and behind the camera.\nFilled with the same crazy humor and comic book style of the original, LUMPIA 2 will distinguish itself with beefed up action choreography, special effects, and KICK-ASS high definition cinematography!  This is the LUMPIA movie we always dreamt of making. That can only become reality if you BACK THAT LUMPIA!\nTHIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN...\nYou won't see these kinds of movies funded by the major studios and even the independents.  This is a movie featuring a primary cast of Filipino Americans starring in an odd story revolving around a HERO who fights with a FILIPINO EGG ROLL?!!!  They'll get more grease then green from this movie. So the only ones who can really greenlight LUMPIA 2 is our core audience! We know the potential size of our open-minded LUMPIA LOVERS out there.  We just need to make sure this KICKSTARTER campaign finds them!  That's why we need our LUMPIA Lovers' help in sharing this campaign.\nYou were there in the theatres when we unleashed THE DEBUT self-distribution tour forcing Hollywood to recognize our growing market leading to a home video deal with Columbia TriStar.\nYou were there in full force when we launched our BLACK EYED PEAS Apl Song campaign to play our music video on MTV in honor of the Filipino World War 2 veterans.\n\nAnd now, we're asking you to join us in raising the funds for our next feature. Our goal is $50,000.  Now that's about 50 times the budget of the original home made movie, but for what we're aiming for in this sequel, it doesn't sound like much.  While our preferred goal is twice that amount, $50,000 is the minimum threshold that proves to us that there is indeed an audience HUNGRY for this movie.  And THAT will be more than enough to motivate and push us to complete this movie all the way through.\n\nOnce our campaign makes its minimum goal, then the FUN PART begins!  We immediately begin pre-production while we continue to push and stretch our funding goal\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nThe final budget we raise will determine what we exactly use them for.  All of our Kid Heroes/Xylophone Films projects inherit less than average budgets and we creatively decide how to utilize those funds in the most resourceful way,  It ULTIMATELY determines which cast/crew we can hire, what equipment/gear we can afford, and which locations we can shoot.  Obviously, the more we raise, the more we can afford and the better our overall production value is.  A $50,000 budget means we beg, borrow, and pull favors just to get through production and have the movie \"in the can\", leaving little funds left for post and beyond.  What we can't afford, we pay with TIME. So the movie will take much longer to complete through post production.  A $100,000 budget allows us more breathing room and a complete post production team that includes visual effects, sound mix, score, color correction, etc. \nREWARDS\nIn return for your support, we're providing these fun LUMPIA-themed packages with different levels of rewards  Are you Fogtown's Finest or the ultimate Thrilla from Serra Manila?  \n\nUPDATED!  \nWe just added a NEW $5 package called \"THE WRAPPER\"\nand now... everyone who donates at least $5+ gets one of these cool BUTTONS made by LUMPIA 2 producer Lillian Prijoles!\nHere are some of the notable rewards we've created just for this Kickstarter campaign...\nFor $30+ everyone gets this shirt!\nAvailable sizes ADULT S, M, L, XL, 2XL\nFor $50+ everyone gets the remastered 10th Anniversary DVD of LUMPIA 1!\n*DVD Box Art NOT FINAL*\nFor $100+ everyone gets the LUMPIA Sequel DVD or Digital Copy!\n*DVD Box Art NOT FINAL*\n*JUST ADDED* $150 RAKENROL *LIMITED SIGNED DVD ONLY 10 AVAILABLE*  \nSigned RAKENROL DVD\nEVERYTHING from LUMPIA-SILOG plus a Special Edition DVD of \"RAKENROL\" AUTOGRAPHED by director QUARK HENARES and co-writer DIEGO CASTILLO as seen in our \"GEEKING OUT WHILE EATING LUMPIA\" episode. \nFor $250+ everyone gets this screen printed LUMPIA poster by Gerald Pilare!\n18 by 24, hand numbered & screen printed; DIFFERENT from giveaway poster\n*EXCLUSIVE* to the $250 FOGTOWN'S FINEST Package, you get this!\nAdult Sizes S, M, L, XL\n\n*JUST ADDED* $400 DA-BUTT! *LIMITED ONLY 2 AVAILABLE* EVERYTHING from FOGTOWN'S FINEST plus a Special Edition DVD of \"THE DEBUT\" AUTOGRAPHED by lead actor DANTE BASCO on the set of our \"GEEKING OUT WHILE EATING LUMPIA\" episode. \nAutographed by lead actor DANTE BASCO\n\n*EXCLUSIVE* to the $500 LUCKY CHANCES BALLA Package, you get this!\nAdult Sizes S.

Will this be an EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or will this end up like GHOSTBUSTERS 2? In the end, all we can do is make the best possible movie with the resources and funding we have. The added bonus is that we are all passionate about this crazy story. The first scene alone hooked us! So our confidence level is at an all-time high and it can only get better when our funding goal is reached.\n\nMany of the challenges will stem from budgetary issues. In those cases, we'll need to scale down and decide what's best for the overall project without sacrificing any creative integrity.\n\nThe biggest issue will be scheduling as many of our crew and cast, including yours truly, have full time jobs. Also, it will be a huge change for our original actors to adapt to the professional movie set environment. But it wouldn't be filmmaking if it was easy and my team and I are up to the challenge. We've weathered every storm and solved every problem that's come up with all the various projects we've shot in the past decade. So we're prepared to tackle all the unique intricacies that LUMPIA 2 will throw at us.\n\nAnd besides, you're talking to a 72-Hour film champion here. I don't just create challenges, I win them!

Click that big button to the right, up there!\nThis will be, as far as I know, the first major comics anthology focusing on sexuality outside of \"gay\" and \"straight\". (Bisexual! Pansexual! Omnisexual! Why-are-you-so-obsessed-with-labeling-me-sexual!)\nFrom contributor MariNaomi, author of the memoir \"Kiss and Tell\"\nI'm passionate about doing this not only because these are great stories from great creators, but because I think bi-phobia is a major cause of homophobia itself, and it's rampant in both straight and gay communities. (See fascinating explanation in \u201cWhat's this got to do with you?\u201d way down below!)\nFrom contributor Bill Roundy, of \"The Amazing Adventures of Bill\"\nBook Details Added 4/13!\nAs more final artwork rolls in, the book details get more and more set, and it's a much more deluxe package than we originally planned!\nThe book clocks in at 210 pages of comics from 30 creators. With the introduction, info about the authors, and title pages, we're looking at a 224-page book! It will be paperback, and have a nice soft-touch finish.\nI've been working on the cover and have a near-final version of it, which incorporates artwork from just a handful of the creators involved. (The final version will have slightly different art inside the title's letters.)\nThe interior covers are going to be a mosaic of artwork from John Lustig of Last Kiss, who provided the unforgettable panel that's served as the \"face\" of this project since the Kickstarter launched.\nNew Reward Added 4/1!\nThis is no April Fool! We've added new $50 and $75 rewards inspired by the brand-new sexual orientation we learned about at our Non-Binary Sexuality panel at Emerald City Comic-Con last month.

Who's going to be in it?\u201d\nWe've assembled a great lineup of talents for Anything That Loves  So far, the contributor list includes:\nAgnes Czaja\nBill Roundy\nEllen Forney\nErika Moen\nJason A.

The work is pouring in now and it's very exciting!\n\u201cSo\u2026 how will you spend the money, if I may ask?\u201d\nOur biggest expense is going to be printing. All Northwest Press books are printed in runs of 2000 copies on an offset press; print-on-demand doesn't look good enough and is also way too expensive per book. A 7x10, full-color, full-length book will cost about $8000 before proofing and incidental costs, plus another $1000 for shipping. If we hit our goal on the nose, just about every penny will go directly to the production of the book.\nAfter Anything That Loves, we have three more books in the works for this year (see the \"Stretch Goals\" below!) and a successful fundraising drive for this book will give us the momentum we need to tackle all four projects comfortably. We'll be able to put Anything That Loves sales revenue immediately into future projects, rather than using it to pay down debt.\n\u201cWhat if you bring in a million-jillion dollars?\u201d\nFirst of all, that's not a number, but I understand your point. If we just meet our goal, we'll be really happy. It will make all the difference to not have to put up the money up front for Anything That Loves, and to skip right to selling copies and saving money for the next project.\nBut, ohhhhh\u2026 if we stretch just a little bit\u2026!\nSTRETCH GOAL:\nPAGE RATES! \u2014 The contributors to Anything That Loves have graciously lent Northwest Press the use of their pages for this book, and Northwest Press is donating royalties from book sales to the nonprofit Prism Comics, in much the same way that our digital edition of the anthology Young Bottoms in Love was done.\nBut if this project is a hit, the creators are the main reason why, and they ought to be compensated.\nUpdated 3/27/13. As the number of contributors to the project grew, the original flat amount per creator started to become unworkable. So I worked out a new plan with the contributors where the numbers will add up right. Now, every $5,000 we make over our Kickstarter goal adds to the amount every artist/team will get paid, based on how many pages they contributed.\nUpdated 4/25/13. Adjusted the formula to account for expanded page count. (Now over 200 pages!)\n$15,000 - $30-85 per contributor (ACHIEVED!)\n$20,000 - $60-171 per contributor (ACHIEVED!) \n$25,000 - $90-257 per contributor (ACHIEVED!)\n$30,000 - $120-343 per contributor\n$50,000 - $240-685 per contributor!\n$75,000 - $390-$1,114 per contributor\nThere's no upper limit on this! If this appeal goes crazy and shoots to the stars, the creators who generously shared their work will be getting an even bigger reward, as it should be.\nSTRETCH GOAL: $25000 (ACHIEVED!)\nTHE LAVENDER MENACE! \u2014 We will now directly fund the production of our upcoming collection of queer super-villain short stories called The Lavender Menace: Tales of Queer Villainy! If you're getting a copy of Anything That Loves as a reward (either digital or print), you can opt to get a copy of this additional book!\nSTRETCH GOAL: $50000\nAL QAEDA'S SUPER SECRET WEAPON! \u2014 If we make this goal, we can directly fund the production of our upcoming erotic political satire Al Qaeda's Super Secret Weapon! If you're getting a copy of Anything That Loves as a reward (either digital or print), we'll also send you this additional book!\nA scene from Dave Zelman's \"Al Qaeda's Super Secret Weapon\". Your mind will be blown!\nSTRETCH GOAL: $75000\nQU33R! \u2014 If we make this goal, we can also send out a digital/print copy of Robert Kirby's all-new deluxe comics collection QU33R, featuring 33 amazing queer indie comics talents. If you're getting a copy of Anything That Loves as a reward (either digital or print), we'll also send you this additional book! (This book will be released in the Fall, and shipped separately.)\n(For all you folks out there who are eyeing that \"I'LL TAKE IT ALL\u2026 AND MORE! EDITION\" that already includes these books, don't worry. If you pick this reward and we meet these stretch goals, we'll add a super-special something to your shipment. :-)\n\u201cWhat's a gay guy doing editing a bisexual anthology, anyway? What's this got to do with you?\u201d\nOkay, let me start at the beginning. This is going to take a while.\nIT STARTED WITH A PHONE CALL\nOver a year ago, I got a call from Matt, a guy that I knew in art school but hadn't heard from in ages. He was in the process of writing an article about his experience as a bisexual man and wanted to get my perspective on his time in college.\nA lot of my gay classmates had been decidedly hostile to Matt. He described to me the scorn he received\u2014people declining to let him sit at \"the gay table\" with them, constantly yelling taunts at him in the hallways, accusing him of being closeted, accusing him of trying on homosexuality as an art-school affectation. Just out of my teens and still rather self-absorbed, I barely registered his struggle at the time.\nFrom contributor Kate Leth, of \"Kate or Die\"\nMatt says things improved for him somewhat after art school, and he didn't experience as much hostility, even though he continued to be open about his sexuality. Recently, though, he'd endured a new round of taunting from gay co-workers who were dubious about his existence as a bisexual man, despite the fact that he'd been living with this identity for over twenty years. All his old trauma from school came rushing back.\n\u201cHOMOPHOBIC? MAYBE YOU'RE GAY\u201d\nAround the same time I had this conversation with Matt, I'd read an article published in the New York Times about a series of studies undertaken to examine the relationship between feelings of gay identity and homophobic attitudes. The researchers identified a group of self-identified \"highly straight\" people, about 20% of them, who appeared to be concealing some same-sex attraction (or affinity, at least) from the study, and possibly from themselves.\nFrom contributor Randall Kirby, creator of BOP! Comics\nThe fact that people harbor secret same-sex attractions was not the newsworthy part of the study. The big deal was that these individuals were also significantly more likely to favor anti-gay policies and display greater hostility to gay people. This correlation is something that people have noticed over the years, but it had seldom been borne out by scientific method.\nMY GAY IDENTITY IS OPPOSITIONAL\nGay identities are forged in fire: bold and brash personalities that protect us from those who would question and challenge us as we figure out who we are. At the start, and often continuing for the rest of our lives, we are defined in opposition to the straight culture at large. We are at war. This war may be a friendly rivalry most of the time\u2014like \"the war between the sexes\"\u2014but, like that other conflict, it sometimes gets ugly.\nIs it any wonder that another queer college friend\u2014on telling me that she married a man after I asked how she'd been doing\u2014laughed and told me that she felt like a \"traitor\"? Is it any wonder that Erika Moen's readers of her incredibly personal webcomics about both her queer identity and relationship with a man think of her as a threat?\nFrom contributor Erika Moen, creator of DAR!\nIn the course of the conversation I had with Matt, he confided a long list of people that I knew\u2013fellow students, instructors, high-profile artists\u2014who were bisexual but who lived their lives as straight or gay instead.\nIs it any wonder that so many bisexual people choose not to label themselves as such, when faced with the prospect of alienation from not just the straight world, but the gay one as well?\nIf we're at war, how can you be trusted if you don't pick sides?\nTYING IT ALL TOGETHER\nWhile I was on the phone with Matt, talking about the gay and straight people that had such a problem believing he was a bisexual man, I had something of an epiphany.\nSome of the people in this study I read about in the Times, it occurred to me, could well be gay, but wasn't it more likely that most were bisexual? Think about it; why would someone cling to the myth of \"it's a choice\" unless they really felt, deep down, that they had to make one?\nCould the refusal to accept the existence of bisexuality be the major obstacle to ending homophobia altogether?\nFrom contributor Sam Orchard, creator of \"Rooster Tails\"\nI'd always felt really removed from the concept of bisexuality; I'd been supportive of them and their challenges, but they felt like another letter in the list, another smaller category, banding together with us in the battle, out of necessity.\nNow I was faced with the prospect that our failures as a gay community and as a broader culture to more fully embrace bisexual people could be actively hurting all of us.\nWith that realization, I knew I had to change my thinking about the binary nature of sexuality, and rethink the oppositional nature of my gay identity. I had to find a way to welcome everyone who would embrace queer people as sisters and brothers, and tear down the divisions that hurt us and the people we care about.\nANYTHING THAT LOVES: THE ANTHOLOGY\nThis happened at the start of a year full of comics conventions, and I have not stopped talking about this subject since. Everywhere I went, all over the country, I got involved in deep discussions about sex and sexuality, about communities and divisions. My desire to take action was undeniable.\nWhat I ended up doing was reaching out to a broad spectrum of talented people\u2014 high profile names in comics and rising stars alike\u2014to tell tales about the complicated nature of sexuality, and to set aside the \"queer enough\" questions and the \"too complicated\" worries that often haunt LGBT comics projects. I wanted to make a truly groundbreaking collection of stories that were all about the complexity, unpredictability, diversity, and beauty of human sexuality.\nFrom contributor Ellen Forney, author of \"I Was Seven in \u201975\" and \"Marbles\"\nI want this project to shake things up. I want it to spark discussions. I hope that seeing other peoples' individual journeys, no matter where those journeys take them, will inspire readers to look beyond limiting labels and categories, to lay down arms in the battle, and work toward a day when we're not \"gay\" and \"straight\", but \"human\".\nIT JUST GOT REAL!\nThe main reason I'm reaching out for community support for this project\u2014aside from the fact that I love this topic and this book and want to share it with everyone\u2014 is because, as of this year, running Northwest Press has become my day job.\nThanks for the sudden, surprise shove out of the nest, previous day job of eight years! Oh, wait\u2026 actually \"$@#! you, previous day job\". (It's a messed-up story. Ask me at a convention and I'll tell you.)\nNorthwest Press has been publishing quality graphic novels and comics for the past three years. We've gotten rave reviews for our books, which we strive to make \"bookshelf worthy\" and higher-quality than you might expect from a niche press.\nOur hard work has been getting us noticed. The work that artist Mark Brill and I did on The Power Within anti-bullying comic got us featured in Out Magazine's \"Out 100\" for 2011. Northwest Press was voted Publisher of the Year by Cartoonists Northwest. We've had three books nominated for Lambda Literary Awards, and our very first book\u2014Teleny and Camille, Jon Macy's epic adaptation of the \"first gay novel\"\u2014took home the Lammy for Best Gay Erotica.\nOur most recent Lammy nomination is Dylan Edwards' \"Transposes\"\nThe first step in launching a publishing business is building up a catalog and promoting the heck out of it, which always puts you in the red. Having my day job kept NWP on a pretty steady release schedule without amassing too much debt, so I didn't have to delay books or scale back advertising or appearances. We're at the end of that phase anyway but, to be safe, I wasn't planning on leaving the job until the end of this year or later.\nNow, with no steady source of income to keep the panic attacks away, I've decided to go all in. (Okay, Amanda Palmer? Here I am, asking. Just like you told me to. Fingers crossed.)\n\u201cYou're right. That was a lot to read.\u201d\nI know, right? Thanks for making it this far.\n\u201cHow about another video as my reward?\u201d\nSure!\nI moderated a panel at Emerald City Comicon on March 3 called \"Beyond Categories: Non-Binary Sexuality in Comics\", and had a fun, irreverent and incredibly interesting conversation with Randall Kirby, Erika Moen, Leia Weathington, Ellen Forney and Jason Thompson. Erika was kind enough to record the proceedings and post them to Vimeo.\n\u201cHeh. \u2018Wibbly-wobbly\u2019.\"\nIsn't that fun? We've got to make t-shirts.\nSeriously though, Northwest Press is one of the few comics publishers that actively seek out and support a wide variety of LGBT comics work. I founded the company because I saw beautiful stories being marginalized and passed over because publishers didn't know what to do with them.\nWe know what to do with them: nurture them, put them among good company, and invite everyone to come take a look.\nHelp us make the launch of Anything That Loves a big success and we promise to continue doing just that.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Anything That Loves\" is already well underway and will be solicited to comics shops to ship in late Summer.

She was so excited, but little did she know, I was about to become a sewing machine hog.\nI wanted a smaller more versatile wallet that could make my life easier, so I took over the kitchen table for a month and sewed for hours every night. After realizing it no longer was just a one wallet project, I shifted everything into my office.\nThis was the first wallet I made for myself. This was before it became known as the Crabby Wallet. I am glad it has evolved into something much better.\nThe first wallet didn't look too good, but I liked the functionality of it. With a lot of trial and error and some coaching from my mom, I was able to make the wallet look, feel, and function better.\nI sketched out a better version of the wallet and started on round two.\nAfter I hand sketched the wallet, I opened Illustrator to create a version that would allow me to move the pieces around.\nI made some changes and then created a pattern to start making wallets for my friends and family.\nThis is the first batch of wallets that I made for other people to test and give feedback. (The long keyring loops are attached to these wallets, but the picture is too dark to see them and they are tucked in the front pocket).\nMy wife posted this Instagram of my wallets requesting people to test them. I mailed them out and received some feedback on the wallets.\nAdding color seemed to be the next appropriate thing to do. I also attached the keyring loop on the inside of the front pocket this round as a different option. I found that the loop was more useful on the outside and smaller.\nAt this stage, the crab comes in. Most people know me as \"Crabby\" (derived from my last name). Everyone naturally started calling it the Crabby Wallet. The name stuck, and I knew I had to mark the wallet with a crab.\nI didn't have the equipment to put the crab on the wallet, so I started making connections with some manufacturers to see how it could be done. This is the prototype they sent back with a crab embroidered on it.\nWith a prototype on hand, I needed some pictures and video for Kickstarter. I bought some PVC, white bed sheets, umbrellas, and some tripods to put together a shooting studio in my office.\nHere are the final wallet options for Kickstarter backers. All of the wallets I made were of colors I found at local craft stores. With your backing I will be able to have the wallets manufactured in regular solid colors.\nWallet Specs: \nDimensions- 3 7/16\" x 2\" x 1/8\" \nMaterial- Elastic\nPockets - 2 \nAttachment loop\nCard securing band (can fit over an iphone)\nCapacity- 10+ Cards \nColors- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Grey, Black\nTrue Story: \nMy friend lost his credit card in his wallet.\nMy wife and I recently returned home from a vacation to California with some friends. As we were getting ready to board our flight, my friend couldn't find his credit card. He contacted the rental car company thinking he had left it in the car after filling up with gas. The rental company double checked the car, but found nothing. My friend searched his wallet over and over again, but still couldn't find it. Fearful he would have to cancel his card, he resorted to emptying all of the contents of his wallet while seated on the plane. I was amazed at the heaping pile of stuff that came out. Luckily for my friend, he found his credit card hidden deep in his wallet.\nFor me, the vacation went smoothly using my Crabby Wallet. In fact, it was more convenient than I had ever expected. Clearing security at the airport was easier than ever with my car key and phone securely bundled with my wallet. My ID was easily accessible when required.\nWhile at the theme parks in California, I had everything I needed and nothing more all in my front pocket with my Crabby Wallet. The wallet made the trip so simple. All of the park's reentry tickets and fast pass tickets slid easily into the front access pocket. Needless to say, I didn't lose my credit card in my wallet unlike my friend. I did however, lose my wedding ring. I guess I should have attached it to my Crabby Wallet somehow.\nGoal:\nHave enough backers to put a crab in your pocket!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI know that timely fulfillment of rewards is extremely important to backers.

Open source Android apps are next.\n\nThe RFduino has a Nordic 32 bit ARM Cortex-M0 processor, so it has more power then the UNO, however it still runs the same, simple Arduino code the UNO runs, so there is no need to learn any new programming language or environment.  Your standard Arduino sketches run on the RFduino.\n\nThe RFduino GPIO lines all support, Digital IO, Analog ADC, SPI, I2C, UART and PWM.  There are 7 GPIO and fully software selectable and can be remapped as you wish.\n\nThe RFduino is similar to the Arduino UNO or DUE, except the RFduino is a fraction of the cost and size, in addition has wireless smartphone connectivity built-in!\nUp to now, adding wireless to an Arduino required an additional wireless shield which adds cost and size.  The RFduino has wireless built-in, so there is no need for an additional wireless shield.\nThe ultra small, finger-tip size board shown in video cover picture above has been put into an easy to use DIP form factor with 0.100\" (2.54mm) pins, so it easily plugs directly into your solderless breadboards.\n\n$5K goal met within the 1st day!\n\n$10k stretch goal met within 2 days!

In addition, the RFduino has a powerful ARM Cortex processor and Bluetooth Low-Energy 4.0 built-in, which take your projects to the next level!\nPowerful enough to run your projects.\nSmall enough to fit inside your projects.\nLow cost enough to be used for all your projects.\nIt's perfect for the hobbyist creating do-it-yourself projects, to professional engineers producing proof-of-concept prototypes.\nIt can be used with or without Bluetooth 4.0.\nBeginners can use the pre-written Arduino sketches and advanced users can write their own from scratch.\nWe have several open-source RFduino and iPhone apps which are free to use, extend and share.\n\nStackable Shield Accessory Boards\nThe RFduino has been constructed with high quality, leading edge, state-of-the-art professional grade components.\nWe have also developed a few miniature accessory boards to help you with your projects.  They plug directly into 0.100\" (2.54mm) standard spacing, solderless breadboards or run fully stand-alone.

It'll grow into you the way your favorite sweatshirt should \u2014 getting softer with wear, keeping you warm and snuggly, and stacking up stories along the way.\n2 - Built for life, guaranteed to last at least a decade and backed with FREE mending! Every stitch tells a story \u2014 put it through its paces and it'll actually get better, more interesting, and more unique over a lifetime of wear. \n3 - A battle cry: Not everything should be disposable. Companies have systematically lowered your expectations to the point where it's hard to know what to expect anymore. But it ends here.\n4 - 100% Made in America. The tags, the labels, even the fabric (all the way down the yarn and the cotton it's made from) are domestically produced.\n5 - Sold direct. Premium sweatshirts cost anywhere from $130 - $190+ in department stores. Cheap ones are only a few bucks less. And that's without the guarantee, domestic production or free mending, of course. Flint and Tinder is cutting out the middleman to keep the price to just half of what it should be. \nTHE STORY:\nIt starts when the Flint and Tinder team overheard a conversation in a factory we were visiting. Someone was talking about using coarse thread with delicate fabric. Doing this accelerates the process of wearing holes into a garment as it goes through the dryer time and time again. \nIn the manufacturing industry, knowing that something will need to be replaced instead of fixed is known as \"planned obsolescence.\" Increasingly it's become the norm.\nIt doesn't have to be this way though \u2014 far from it. Eager to prove a point, send a message, and make a sweatshirt that could last a lifetime (the way your favorite sweatshirt should), we set out to make a premium piece that's so well constructed customers would rather have it mended (free of charge, of course) than replaced. \nWe'd like to think we've done just that. It's more than a sweatshirt though; it's a battle cry. Not everything should be disposable. It's time to buy less, but get more!\nCOLORS:\nThe 10-Year Hoodie is available in the following colors:\nUNISEX FIT:\nFlint and Tinder's 10-Year Hoodie was designed in a slim, modern fit (nearly identical to that offered by JCrew).\nIt is unisex, but the female model shown at the top is wearing a medium, not the small she normally wears. (Currently, we've only made samples in medium, as soon as enough people order we'll begin producing them in all sizes, so you can see before selecting size.)\nWe'll get your size and color selections after the funding period has closed. Rest assured though, we'll have a detailed sizing guide for you to reference at that time to ensure the perfect fit.\nSUPERIOR COMFORT & DETAILS:\nNOTE: By popular request, the leather pull on the zipper is now optional. We'll get your preference at the end of the funding period. We've scoured the globe for a rare 100% cotton18 oz. all-weather knit, one with a tight enough weave to last a lifetime, but where the yarns were spun in such a way that it will actually get softer over time. The fleece we chose is made of 3-end yarns, which means 3 separate yarns are spun together to create a stronger quality. Best of all: We found the last standing manufacturer of this fabric right here in America!\nWe chose a custom raglan style sleeve for comfort and full range of motion, without bagginess. (Go ahead, put your arms above your head - see how the waist-line barely comes up? That's raglan for you.)\nThe 3-piece lined hood and kangaroo pockets are oversized, and the fabric around the zipper \"kisses\" (covers the teeth without getting in the way) so you'll stay cozy for years to come!\nBy popular request, we've now added an inner pocket!\nIt measures 5 in. x 7 in. That's deep enough to tuck an iPhone 5 in an extra large case with room to spare. The pocket will include bar tacks on all stress points for maximum durability. Throw your wallet in there, or your keys on a run, and you'd literally have to hang upside down on the monkey bars to have them jostle free!\nDURABILITY:\nTHEIRS:\nSeams, even at stress points, are made by bringing the pieces of fabric together, pushing both exposed edges inwards, then sewing them together with a single needle. THE PROBLEM: Once a single thread or stitch is broken, the whole thing unravels. Outward pressure on the seam accelerates the process. \nOURS:\nAll stress seams are reinforced with a mock safety stitch for extreme durability. We begin by overlapping the pieces, then sewing it down on both exposed edges (first with a cover stitch, essentially a series of tiny knots that if broken along their chain maintain integrity elsewhere, then a double-needle) to make sure they're never coming undone. It's flat on the inside, and looks almost like piping on the outside. You will not find this on lesser-made garments.\nThe cuff and sweep are made of a heavy-weight ribbing with Lycra to retain shape and create better recovery.\nWe've added a custom F+T zipper pull to an industrial zipper that is reinforced with heavy-duty twill tape for long lasting wear.\nFREE MENDING:\nOver time, every stitch tells a story. As the years go on, this sweatshirt will become more and more unique, comfortable, recognizable and your own!\nSure, we've made it to last a lifetime and are guaranteeing it for the next decade, but we'll also mend it free of charge should life ever get in the way. What exactly does that mean? If your hoodie rips, tears, or otherwise comes apart at the seams, send it back to us. It's not that it's so cheap we can replace it, it's that it's so well made, we'll make it whole before returning it to you!\nYou'll have two choices: Contrast thread or thread of the same color.\nTHE PATCHES:\nTHE TEAM:\nFlint and Tinder began life with just one guy, Jake, noticing that all of the underwear in the underwear aisle of major department stores seems to have been made in other countries. He put the video above on Kickstarter, and 30 days later had sold several times his original goal.\nToday, Flint and Tinder is a team of 5. We are America's first and only premium, high-volume manufacturer of men's underwear. We'd love to add a premium sweatshirt to the line.\nTo make the minimums required to get production going, we need 1,000 people need to raise their hands and tell the world it's time to buy less but get more!\nTHE FINE PRINT:\nThere's really not much fine print - if you send the thing back to us, we'll fix it and send it back to you. Return postage is on us (that is to say, shipping back to you once you've shipped it to us for mending), but give us a heads up before dropping it in the box. Also, international customers will have to pay shipping both ways (last time we did this, just shipping a single package to Dubai cost $60. In cases such as those, we reserve the right to ask for a bit more to ship the sweatshirt out in the first place, once actual and final shipping costs have been calculated. Unfortunately, this can't be done in advance as shipping costs vary by country and Kickstarter doesn't tell us where you are until after the funding period has closed. We will not be making money on shipping though and will be transparent about these costs). We cannot fix stains or lost strings.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you SO much for the support! We will not let you down.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first Rodeo. \n\nIn May of 2011, Flint and Tinder went on Kickstarter asking for support in setting-up America's first high-volume, premium men's underwear production. We wound up selling nearly 10 times the amount we'd planned on selling (close to 30,000 pairs when it was all said and done) making us, at that time, the top Fashion Kickstarter of all time. \n\nProducing anything, let alone your first product, at high-volume poses a number of problems.

He's the handsome grab-and-go solution.\nNow instead of a bulky case or a wallet with an iPhone pocket, Wally clings directly to the back of your iPhone with micro-suction. This high-tech material gives Wally a grip like a gentleman: strong and secure, without leaving behind any tackiness. Micro-suction is awesome for naked iPhones, but adheres to glossy or slick cases only -- which is why we'll also include Alternahesive not just for the backers who request it, but for EVERY BACKER! Thank you, backers, for getting us to our Stretch Goal and beyond!\nHave you hacked together a way to carry cards with your iPhone? Or maybe you bought a wallet/case thingy but it limits your iPhone access? We hear you... So we literally went back to the drawing board and crafted a totally new way to carry the essentials: \nSlim Accommodates the 3 cards you carry most\nSmart Micro-suction securely attaches without being sticky \nDiscreet Pull-tab action conceals your contents \nHandcrafted Made in the USA with premium Italian leather\niPhone, camera, cards and ID or cash \u2013 all combined and ready to go. Our leather craftsman in Florida, Tim Kennedy, has been a great collaborator in getting the construction as thin as possible, while comfortably accommodating up to 3 cards (PRO TIP: use apps like Lemon to handle the rest). Of course, you can still carry a Costanza wallet and let Wally hold what you use the most \u2013 business cards, cash, metro card \u2013 right where you want it, and out of sight until you need it. \n_____________________________________________________\nInstead of holding a wallet up to your ear, just hold your iPhone. Crafted using premium, vegetable-tanned leather from Tuscany, Wally makes your iPhone more comfortable to hold. The vegetable-tanned leather wears beautifully over time, just like your favorite leather wallet. Luckily, Wally just looks like a handsome leather iPhone skin.\nInstead of advertising the contents of your wallet, Wally keeps your cards and cash hidden. Access your stash simply by pulling on Wally\u2019s integrated pull-tab; pushing your cards back in retracts the tab.\nUPDATE: Improved Wally Design Based on User Testing\nWally is available in Ninja Black or Cowboy Brown, custom made either for iPhone 5 or iPhone 4/4S (photos of each Wally on our website). Simply select the Wally reward you want, and that's what you'll receive. We have everything we need to make Wally, but need your help to go into production.

We've done a pilot run with the actual materials so we can run tests to minimize surprises and work out the kinks. We are seeking the funding needed to cover the cost of the dies, leather, micro-suction material, and Made-in-the-USA manufacturing. Our goal amount is the break-even cost to manufacture our first production run (plus the Kickstarter and Amazon fees, as much as 10%). We've set a realistic goal to cover the costs to launch a product that we truly feel is great!

From a completely new, beautiful and sleek design, to new technology from the inside out, we\u2019ve completely rethought what a stylus can be. We have developed two versions, one that supports iPad and one for Apple Displays (glass) and iMacs (Mid 2007 and newer) running either Mac OS or Windows.\nFeatures\nPressure Sensitive: iPen 2 recognizes up to 1024 levels of pressure. Our new mechanical design makes capturing your nuanced ideas effortless. iPen will work as a standard mouse with all the apps you already have and love. Pressure recognition is currently supported in Corel Painter and Autodesk Sketchbook in Mac OS and Windows and support for more application is on the way.\nAngle Agnostic: Because iPen 2 emits its signal from the very tiny pen tip, it gives you same accuracy no matter how you hold the stylus. No problem for lefties!\nLightweight Inking: iPen 2 captures the comfort and feel of writing with a ballpoint pen. Compared with iPen 1, iPen 2 takes 75% less weight to generate inking. This new feature means a lot especially to speedy writers and will help when writing in quiet locations.\nPrecise Pen Tip: iPen 2 uses a precise tip enabling you to better see exactly where you are inking. This puts us ahead of competing products which use plastic discs which obstruct your view of the screen.\nUse in Airplane Mode: Because our technology doesn\u2019t rely on Bluetooth, iPen can be used on flights when your iPad is in Airplane mode.\nPalm Rejection: Focus on your work, not on deleting mistakes due to resting your hand on the screen. Put your palm down and sketch or draw naturally!\nUniversal stylus for iMac and Apple Displays\niMac model retails for $169\niPen 2 is a next generation stylus that enables you to write directly on your screen. It is designed for iMac and Apple Displays with glass panels. With our new technology, iPen 2 turns your non-touch Apple Display into a stylus friendly screen which is compatible with every application in Mac OS and Windows. Use your iPen 2 as your stylus or mouse as needed. The included stand will hold and charge your iPen 2 and receivers when not in use.\niPad model with smart iPad case\niPad model retails for $119\niPen 2 for iPad brings the dream of accurate and expressive writing and drawing to your iPad. Our Apple Smart Cover compatible case protects your iPad while doubling as the iPad receiver. It also holds and charges your iPen 2 when not in use. Compatible with iPad 2 and newer with support for both Lightning and 30-pin connections.iPad mini support planned once we meet our funding goal.\nLimited iPad apps but with a better user experience\nDue to iOS restriction, iPen 2 is not a universal stylus for iPad. We learned from iPen 1 that quality is more important than quantity; it\u2019s the user experience that really matters. To create a better user experience, we are making a standalone calibration app so developers can focus on a few simple things like external accessory protocol. As iPen 2 users, you only have one calibration tool which sits on your screen. Because iPen 2 is angle agnostic, it produces the same accuracy performance in each supported app once it calibrated.\niPen 2 uses different chipsets from iPen 1. We have completed the new firmware and feature testing on the iPad. Our next move is to work with app developers on integration. We can\u2019t provide a list of supported apps at this time, but here are our existing app developers for your reference. Our goal is to bring the best writing and drawing experience to the iPad with the best quality apps.If you are an interested developer, please email us at dev@cregle.com.\niPad 5 compatibility\niPad 5 is expected to hit the market this spring and we plan to have the iPen receiver case compatible with iPad 5. As we won\u2019t know the details until then, we can only say that we will make a new case for it if the current Lighting compatible case will not fit. iPen 2 backers will receive further updates when we get our hands on a iPad 5.\nThe iPad mini model?\nWe believe people are going to love the iPad mini model of iPen 2, but we need additional funding to get this done. If we can reach the funding goal in a month, we will be able to kick off this mini project in time. So please help us to spread the word. With your support, we can really make this happen!\nTechnology\nDifferent from iPen 1, iPen 2 uses invisible light and receivers to achieve a stylus experience that is angle agnostic. The receivers are tiny cameras that capture the invisible light from the pen tip and triangulate its exact location. With this new approach, you will be able to draw a straight line even at the bottom of the screen, as the signal does not decay.\nManufacturing Plan\n12/2012 Complete engineering verification testing (EVT)\n01/2013 Finalize mass production details with Apple licensed OEM\n02/2013 Initiate tooling & design verification testing (DVT)\n04/2013 Initiate production verification testing (PVT)\n05/2013 Submit final production units to Apple for MFi final approval\n06/2013 Deliver iMac model - MFi is Not required!\n07/2013 Deliver iPad model\niPen 2 needs you\niPen 2 is designed to write on every screen. With your help, we will be able to build this amazing stylus and continue our innovation. Your pledge will be used for:\nMass production including tooling, testing, assembling and purchase of customized components.\nOptimize iPen driver with advanced features.\nWith extra funding, we will be able to design different receivers for other screens.\nAbout the video\nThe demo video is taken with iPen 2 engineering sample. Demo apps include Angry Bird, Art Rage, Deskscribble, FluidMath, Keynote, SpellTower, SketchUP and Sketchbook Pro.\niMac, iPad and 'Made for iPad' are registered trademarks of Apple, Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing a Kickstarter project into mass production has never been easier. Back when we were producing iPen 1, the delivery was postponed for 2 months due to the delay of getting Apple MFi approved. We learned our lesson and we planned very cautiously this time to get everything in order in preparation for submission for Apple MFi approval. As an iPen 2 backer, please understand the following risks and challenges:\n\nStylus Size and Battery\n\nThe current EVT unit is 12mm wide, and has a rechargeable battery with 6 hours continuous writing. Our goal is to cut the width to 10 mm and increase the battery life to 8 hours or more. This requires optimization of the design to meet our efficiency and usability requirements and offer you the best stylus experience available.\n\niMac Receiver for New iMac\n\nThe iMac Receiver is compatible with all iMac models since 2007. We want this receiver to fit all Apple Displays elegantly, which takes a lot of effort to design both externally and internally. The challenge is how to attach receiver to the new iMac (Late 2012) securely and blend in as it has a much thinner edge. We\u2019re working on it now!\n\nDelivery Schedule for \u201cMade for iPad\u201d Model\n\nThe iPad model has to go through Apple MFi program. With new stricter rules, we need to work with an Apple licensed OEM for mass production. The whole process will take four to six months.\n\nThe Pen Tip\n\nWe plan to use a black coating on the outside of pen tip in order to boost the performance of light signal inside the stylus. This might raise quality control issue during the mass production phase. Therefore, it\u2019s possible we will have different pen tip color or shape for the retail unit. Quality control is our top priority during mass production.\n\nAdobe Photoshop in Mac OS & Windows\n\nAs of Today, iPen 2 is not pressure sensitive in Photoshop. We need to request specific driver information from Adobe to make this work.

Back then my only wish for Roomie was to see it update more or less regularly, and perhaps even make it a \"real\" webcomic. That was how far I imagined things to go, if I was lucky! -End of flashback- Cue present moment. \nGo Get a Roomie has its own proper website, is now read by tens of thousands of people from all across the world, has received overwhelming love, touching feedbacks, brilliant fanarts, (great help too), and today, has a chance to be published into a real, printed book.

Naturally, it was rated NSFW. But never fear, the boobs are here to ease your discomfort. Quite a plentiful too, as the main character, Roomie, never fails to cast away her clothes whenever the occasion rises (well, she makes her own occasions, really). Now that we have two ingredients in the Go Get a Roomie recipe (universal love, and an outgoing hippie), let's add in bits of friendship and a big dose of Lillian, the Lazy Tyke. Lillian is Roomie's opposite in many ways: where Roomie parties, she sleeps (aka: a whole friggin' lot), where Roomie drinks, she reads fairy-tale books, and where Roomie has sexy fun with varieties of lovely ladies, Lillian remains one of the very few who doesn't fall for the hippie's charms. \n Go Get a Roomie includes many other friends, one more bizarre and lovable than the other, and offers a different way of seeing life and all living beings. Since its first page, the comic has been there to corrupt the world with fond smiles and happy sighs. If it can continue to do so through a new printed form, it would make a dream come true. Not only will the first book of Go Get a Roomie include all of chapters 1-12, but countless other extras as well!

Send this link to friend who has an idea of something they want to build/create.\n\"David Lang is an inspiration to anyone who has dreamed of making, but has been hesitant to start because they feel they don't have the necessary skills. As David will show you, all it takes is curiosity, passion, and a willingness to learn from your mistakes.\"\n- Mark Frauenfelder, editor-in-chief of MAKE Magazine, founder of Boing Boing, and author of Made by Hand\n\"Many entrepreneurs have heard the prediction that 'hardware is the new software.' Well, David is laying out a lean approach to building the right skills to help you get into the action.\" - Patrick Vlaskovits, entrepreneur and author of The Lean Entrepreneur\nBy this point, you've probably heard of the maker movement. A growing contingent of garage tinkerers who have been steadily building an impressive (and mostly grass-roots) infrastructure of maker/hackerspaces, new digital fabrication tools, and online collaboration platforms. By now, the makers have been fairly well covered by mainstream media like CNN, The New York Times, and The Economist. (If you want the full past, present and future of the maker movement, Chris Anderson's new book Makers is a wonderful read.)\nIt's one thing to read about this curious maker world, but quite another to immerse yourself into it, which is what I've done for the past year and a half. And what I've found has been both riveting and encouraging.\nMy Story\nAfter losing my office job in the summer of 2011, I was forced to rethink my career trajectory. All of a sudden, it seemed that my education and work experience had prepared me for a future that wasn\u2019t coming. The \"knowledge\" that I thought was my ticket in life was now the source of my insecurity, the reason I felt distanced from work that is meaningful, tangible, and measurable. Instead of scrambling back into the rat race and praying for a new job that wouldn\u2019t vanish, I decided to focus on building the fundamental skills I had somehow managed to skip over; the skills that would enable me to create, develop or repair something useful or essential. I was looking to create a bridge between foundational knowledge of how things work and what their potential can be with the help of the latest technology. The first step was to recreate the shop classes my high school never offered. I immersed myself in this new maker movement by spending two months taking every class I could at TechShop in San Francisco: wood working, laser cutting, CNC machining, CAD, welding, and everything in between. \nI had a lot to learn, and the welcoming community in which I found myself was happy to guide me. In fact, it wasn't long before I learned enough to be able to help others who were also in the process of re-skilling. \n\nIn a span of several months I flipped the switch from being an interested onlooker to an active participant. In less than a year, I went from a maker novice to card-carrying evangelist; from a tool-illiterate enthusiast to a partner in a fledgling underwater robot business. What I thought was an insurmountable disadvantage of never having used a soldering iron, turned out to be a phantom obstacle. Now, my biggest concern is how we're going to fill all the orders for the robot kit I helped develop. It's a much better problem to have. \nAnd believe me, I'm the last person who ever thought I'd be singing this tune. Having labeled myself as mechanically incompetent and manually illiterate, I presumed that my relationship with devices would always be strictly utilitarian. Alexis Madrigal sums up my sentiments exactly:\n\"You know how some kids take apart clocks and toasters just to see how they work? Well, I used them as god intended, to tell time and make toast.\" \nLooking back, I see that the presumption was based on an irrational fear of the unknown, which I wish I could've faced sooner. All the new tools and terminology that seemed so intimidating were more accessible and usable than I ever imagined.\n\nBut the biggest surprise was the discovery that my experience is entirely replicable. Thanks to new rapid prototyping technologies, the tools of making are easier than ever to access and learn. All across the country and beyond, the maker community is self-organizing to create fab labs and makerspaces, which serve as cheap and accessible DIY classrooms. It doesn't require a major life change (like losing a job or facing a similar crisis) to get involved. These are skills you can develop on part time basis - a few nights a week or a weekend here and there. In fact, no matter what your day job may be, you\u2019ll find these new skills can be complimentary and helpful in your everyday life.\nThe opportunity to join this new industrial revolution is growing everyday. The biggest hurdle is deciding to get started.\nThe ZERO TO MAKER book\nMy break came when MAKE Magazine gave me the opportunity to chronicle my Zero To Maker story on the MAKE blog. This gave me a chance to meet incredible makers and hear their stories about how they got started. Their insights and advice were too good to not be broadcast.\nEven with all the attention that the maker movement has garnered, some people still feel it is too intimidating and prohibitive to take the plunge. An autonomous robot may be awe-inspiring in theory, but if you are hanging on to your cubicle job, it's hard to imagine it as a possible career move. It's easy to see the potential of a desktop 3D printer when you've got a masters degree in industrial design, but nearly impossible to understand how it fits (and why it should be included) into your busy schedule and everyday life. A mental bridge must be crossed to see making as an opportunity worth pursuing, whether as a new career or a serious hobby. I know because I had to cross that bridge.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t want to do it by myself. As I quickly discovered, making is very little about DIY - it's all about DIT (Do-It-Together). In the maker movement, the art of collaboration is the key to innovation and productivity. The Zero To Maker book will be no different. It's going to be a team effort, and you are a big part of it!\nBy supporting this Kickstarter project, you'll be part of the team. The goal is to get as many new makers involved as possible. The money will go to 1) keeping me alive during the next several months 2) making the book an excellent physical product (in addition to a great resource) - something you'll like holding in your hands.\nIt's not just a book, it's an invitation...\nThis isn't just an ordinary book that you could find on Amazon or at a Barnes and Noble. I want you to come with me. It's going to be a year-long digital and physical tour of this curious Maker world. I want to show you all the delightful little corners, the inspiring characters, and immense opportunity. \nMaker Interviews on G+\nWe're going to have a series of eight live interviews on Google+ On Air Hangouts with some of the amazing makers I've met over the past year. The interviews will run   on select Wednesday nights (6pm Pacific Time) in February, March, and April (schedule to follow in an update). Our interviews will be:\nDale Dougherty, founder & publisher of MAKE: Magazine and co-creator of Maker Faire \nChris Anderson, CEO of 3D Robotics, author of Makers, formerly editor-in cheif of WIRED\nMitch Altman, founder of Noisebridge and creator of TV-B-Gone, Neurodreamer Sleep Mask, etc.\nAbe and Lisa Fetterman, Creators of the DIY Sous Vide Machine and founders of Nomiku\nBilal Ghalib, Maker Evangalist for Autodesk/Instructables, Founder of GEMSI\nand more inspiring makers!\nBackers at the \"Join the Show!\" Level will get to join the Hangout and ask specific questions. (Each show will have 5 Backer Slots, with backers getting a first-backed, first-choice decision on which show to join.)\nMaker Fellowships\nOf course, the DIT experience wouldn't be complete unless we actually get our hands dirty and MAKE STUFF. I'm teaming up with TechShop, The Mill, and other makerspaces around the country to create Maker Fellowships, a two-month program and introduction to making. Each location will accommodate up to four Maker Fellows for the two-month program. It starts with an immersive maker weekend:\nThen a combination of classes over the course of two month program (choose 3) depending on where your project takes you:\nMetalshop \nWoodshop \nShopbot CNC \nAutodesk Inventor 1, 2, 3 (TechShop Locations only) \nCAD to CAM \nVinyl Cutter CNC\nI'll be at each of the locations for the Zero to Maker weekend, then following up remotely for the duration of the program. Based on my experiences, the opportunity to have a cohort of other Maker Fellows (up to four at each location) will make a huge difference. The compact schedule will get right to the point, making sure participants can breeze past the unnecessary hurdles.\n*Important Note: Want to set up a Maker Fellowship program at your makerspace? Send me a message!\nWe're all learning and navigating this new world together. I hope you'll join us!\n\"Yes, the Maker movement is stronger than ever and everything that you need is out there, but that's as much of a crippling statement as it is an inspiring one. How do you know where to start if \"everything\" is there for you? Let David be your technology sherpa, you will travel higher and deeper into making what you want than ever before and after you plant your flag on the top you'll already be chomping at the bit for your next climb.\" - Lisa Fetterman, Co-Founder and CEO of Nomiku", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"If you want to go quickly, go alone.

So far, this process has been fun (and fulfilling), but it certainly lacks any semblance of balance. I feel confident that I can continue to work at this pace for the foreseeable future. For me, the best insurance against burnout is to surround myself with a supportive community who are working on the same goal. In fact, that's where you all come in!\n\nAnother risk is that I, for any reason, am not able to attend the scheduled weekends at TechShop.

I quickly moved through the parts of my story that were hard - the depression, the doubting, the insecurity - because I didn't wish that for anyone else. Probably more honestly, though, I just didn't know how to talk about those moments. I still don't. They're intensely personal. And embarrassing. I know that people are facing far bigger issues and challenges: illness, grief, loss. Those are real problems. Worrying about my lack of creative ability hardly seemed like reason to complain.
