Since then, we have been hand-crafting unique designs for all your tabletop games using the highest quality hardwoods from our local suppliers. During this time, we have grown substantially from a one-man crew to a three-person team. With this Kickstarter we are hoping to expand our team further by hiring more craftsmen, as well as expand our community by attending future conventions! (Once it it safe to do so, of course!)\nWe are excited to launch our new Council of 11 Dice Vaults with 14 different carefully curated sets of precious gemstone and glass dice. Each set comes with a standard 7 piece set of polyhedral dice, an additional D20, and three additional D6s to support any of your gaming needs. In addition, we have partnered with 3 of our favorite artists, 88riddles, Cait Greer, and Xerjester to provide you with many customization options to help beautify your new vault AND support excellent artists.\nWhen first discussing this Kickstarter, we were overwhelmed by the number of gemstone dice options available to choose from. Thankfully, we have a very nerdy, very eager friend group who were more than happy to lend us their expertise to pare down the options. Together we decided on the 14 gorgeous sets of gemstone and glass dice that we are now offering! If you act fast, the first day of launch we are offering an 'early bird' special, where our dice sets will only be $90 each! After which they will be at their regular pricing of $100 per set. \n For this Kickstarter, we are introducing the Council of 11 Dice Vault! Iterating on the design of our widely popular Council of 7 Dice Vaults, each vault features 11 individual felt-lined hexagonal slots, ensuring the safety of your 11 piece dice sets whether on display or at the gaming table! We've selected 18 beautiful hardwoods, both domestic and exotic, to ensure a wood for every aesthetic and budget. \nRaised Prismatic Glass\nPrismatic Glass\nAfrican Bloodstone\nRaised Obsidian with Colored Numbers\nRaised Obsidian\nOpalite\nRaised Green Glass\nRose Quartz\nRaised Garnet\nLapis\nDeep Purple Cats Eye\nRed Tigers Eye\nBlue Cats Eye\nGreen Flourite\nTier \"A\" Dice Vaults ($35)\n Tier \"A\" Dice Vaults are our most affordable tier featuring the classic domestic hardwoods Cherry, Red Oak, Maple, and White Oak.

All the D6's feature the T&C logo in place of the 6.\nWhy does my order look different than the photos?\nWorking with natural materials, there will be variation in all vaults and dice.

Dice by Wyrmwood brought the leader in bespoke tabletop gaming to the world of high-end dice: more than 11,000 backers pledged over $1,500,000 for beautiful dice crafted from gemstone, glass, and more. A few months earlier, Dispel Dice arrived onto the scene with their own campaign, and more than 20,000 backers pledged well over $2,000,000 to make it an incredible success for this first-time creator, launching their brand of sharp-edged, luxury resin dice with inclusions. Now, both brands are ready to take the dice community by storm once again... together.\n\nBrand new, exclusive designs from Dispel Dice, available as sets of seven or, for the first time, as single D20s and sets of 3D6, join new gemstone and glass offerings (along with some returning favorites) from Wyrmwood. But don't worry, we've BOTH got some surprises in store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese three very special pieces combine classic Wyrmwood designs with artwork from Dispel Dice, inlaid in holographic flake, a Dispel favorite, to truly capture the spirit of our collaboration on this project.\nDispel Dice draws inspiration from space and celestial bodies, and this design, inlaid into a Macassar Ebony Dice Vault, is a tribute to that fascination with the heavens.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyrmwood has always drawn inspiration from the foliage of earth, particularly evident in our \u201cGaia Collection\u201d entries. This piece draws from that tradition to stunning effect, with holographic flake and brass inlay on a Macassar Ebony Dice Vault.\nThe first floral design Karen created was the \u201cShe Loves Me (Not?)\u201d set, and this design was crafted specifically to pair with it. The Macassar Ebony Tabletop Vault, paired with brass and holographic flake, will complement any fine set of dice beautifully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Dispel hit the scene in 2019, they hit the ground running with some truly unique designs - but Karen (Founder of Dispel) had some special designs she wasn't sure could be produced... but now that her first campaign has allowed her to establish her own production, they have finally mastered the process of suspending some very special inclusions - real flowers!\n\nThe designs Nightbloom, Dewdrop, and She Loves Me (Not?) feature real flowers preserved in resin. From roses to forget me nots, these designs are for someone who's looking for something a bit more in their set of dice.\n\nTo commemorate these new floral colorways, Dispel's team has designed the Lunar, Rose, and Forget Me Not Vaults. These vaults represent a true marriage between the brands; Wyrmwood vaults inlaid with brass and the very same holographic flake that is used in the Dispel Dice!\n\n\"I've been a fan of Wyrmwood since I've entered the hobby, so it is an absolute privilege to be able to put together a design that represents both of our work.\"  - Karen\n\n\n\nTwo of the biggest names in tabletop gaming, both standing for the highest quality, game-changing innovations, and outstanding service, coming together with new designs and materials you can't get anywhere else... this was already one for the books, but with your help, we're going to make it official: we're attempting a Guinness World Record.\n\nOriginally, the idea to break a world record came from Wyrmwood's first Dice Kickstarter - but never came together. With this campaign, Wyrmwood and Dispel will be organizing the most dice that ever been in a single sequence. How many dice will we be lining up? Well, that's up to all of you...\n\nWith the current record being north of 6,000 dice, we will be attempting to include one die for every backer we have. If we reach at least 7,000 backers we are officially on our way to breaking a world record. If that isn't enough, we will be sending each and every backer one of the dice used in breaking the record! Giving everyone a piece of the record that they made possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks for this project are relatively small, but some do exist. As we've seen in the past year, global supply chains can be disrupted in the event of certain extreme events, such as the global pandemic. Wyrmwood and Dispel Dice are not immune to these issues, though we are better positioned than most.\n\nDispel Dice controls all manufacturing of their dice end to end, as does Wyrmwood with our Dice Vaults and Tabletop Vaults. However, we both require some raw materials and equipment from outside suppliers. In addition, Wyrmwood is turning to a partner to manufacture stone and glass dice, and where there is a supplier, there is always a risk of complications or delays. However, our partner is highly proven and we have confidence in their capacity to meet the demand.\n\nWe have set our delivery dates with our current production and other plans for the year in mind, and are both highly confident in these dates being achievable. We've planned for success with this project, and much of the planning phase has concerned making sure we were ready to meet it, should the project prove very successful.\n\nWyrmwood has successfully completed fulfillment of tens of thousands of pledges across 12 campaigns over the past 8 years. While we have actively fulfilled campaigns, Dispel Dice has fulfilled tens of thousands of orders in their first campaign, and is aggressively shipping more daily, as is Wyrmwood with their active fulfillment. We are both fully committed to fulfilling each and every backer's pledge. Backers should have every confidence in receiving rewards of the highest quality, delivered in a timely fashion according to our estimates, and we will update backers regularly with how the project is going, both before fulfillment and during it, until it's complete.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Wave 5: Dice by Wyrmwood & Dispel", "descp": "Backers at this level should have their pledge items shipped out by the last day of April, 2022.\nPledge for as many sets and add-on items as you like.

The foes detailed in this supplement, ranging from capricious fey to corrupt fiends, can fit nicely into any 5e campaign where the players are looking for a devious and deadly challenge.\nSavage beasts, twisted aberrations, and unrelenting undead: the Monster Grimoire has covered all of your needs. The book also contains a variety of player-facing content to immerse them into a dark setting: terrible familiars, twisted sidekicks, and more!\nIn addition to monster lore and stats, each monster comes with something new and amazing: suggested salvage! Not only will monster entries suggest treasure for the creatures, they detail methods that characters might use to harvest monster parts to turn into equipment or magic items. Want to know what can be made with the fangs of a vanquished vampire? We\u2019ll tell you!\nPlayers expect the unexpected, so as a GM you should always have a surprise ready. The Monster Grimoire provides methods to add surprising changes to your current foes. Utilize monster templates like the fiend and the specter.\nNew monsters are great but using them appropriately can be tricky. This supplement provides in-depth advice and analysis on creating dark fantasy encounters within campaigns that terrify and delight your players, without overwhelming them.\nGrim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire will have 400 terrifying Monsters spread across 5 box sets, giving you 80 quality cards in each set. These will show a visual of the gruesome foe on one side, and all the stats, actions and information specific to each individual creature on the other. These Cards will provide you an excellent reference for each and every Monster in your encounters, right in the palm of your hands!\nAdd-ons are a great way to get an extra item or two from a higher pledge, or previous campaign at a discounted rate! All backers will have access to add-ons, all you have to do is back a tier of this campaign to be invited. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we'll reach out to you and ask you to confirm through the survey which add-ons you would like to purchase. Shipping costs for add-ons will be determined after the Kickstarter along with the survey; however shipping will be approximately $3-$5 per add-on (depending on the physical size of each item).\nStretch goals are our way of giving back to the community as we succeed, however due to the scope of some stretch goals, not all can be free. Any stretch goals with the text 'ADD ON' next to it, require an additional price to purchase.\nAs a result from the incredible successes we have had running playtests in our previous campaigns, we are again inviting backers to join and contribute to this play testing period of Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire. Production of the book and all related content is well underway and play testing is the ultimate way to get a sneak peek into these mechanics, as well as help shape the final product into something great. We can't wait to show you all what we have in store!\nGhostfire Gaming does not use Kickstarter to charge shipping. Once the product dimensions and weights are confirmed, we send a survey email to all backers via a program called BackerKit, which collects shipping on all pledge tiers.\nThe following table has shipping estimates in USD for the Soldier of Fortune pledge tier only. It is based on the average cost for us to ship internationally a single hardcover book of similar dimensions and weight to The Monster Grimoire and is subject to change.\nThe remaining pledge tiers are not subject to the below costs. \nWe design and manufacture our products internationally, and will endeavour to and are always looking for ways to keep shipping costs as low as possible. \nSome of our products are not yet finished which means that as soon as the dimensions and weights are available the shipping costs for the higher pledge tiers will be entered into your BackerKit survey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk is always a concern, so we have taken tangible mitigation steps to manage risk, particularly around fulfillment and manufacturing.\n\nOur top priority is to make an excellent gaming product that will make our brand, backers and community proud.

You can find shipping estimates below for your respective country. We have plans to distribute from the following locations: China (Asia Pacific backers), EU (European backers), UK (UK Backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and California (US and Rest of the World backers). This should allow us to be UK, EU, CA, AUS and NZ customs friendly.\nEU and UK backers, please note that in order for us to comply with the current tax laws that have changed or will change this year, we will be charging VAT in the pledge manger system. EU countries that are not part of the European Union will not be charge VAT. These are the best estimates that we currently have. The information will be final and clearly displayed in BackerKit before confirmation. In Canada, in place of VAT, we will be charging GST in BackerKit.\n\nShipping Restrictions\nAt this time, we are not able to ship to the following locations: Latin America*, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, and Cuba. We hope to have a global trade release after the Kickstarter is fulfilled and we apologize for not being able to offer this Kickstarter to those countries. Due to the size of the packages, we cannot ship to P.O. boxes. *Mexico is excluded - we will be able to ship to Mexico.\n\nFor VAT details, click here.\nFor GST details, click here.\n\nWork in Progress\nThe images shown are work in progress (many are marked Final Design Pending) and the look of the items in this Kickstarter may differ from what was presented while the Kickstarter was active. We have marked the items that might change, however anything in the Kickstarter could differ from what was shown. We are however working hard to make sure that what you see is what you get.\n\nLocalization & Languages\nThe plan for Worldbook: Lawbrand post-Kickstarter is to ensure that you\u2019ll be able to find the sourcebook through wherever you currently purchase your tabletop RPG books. We\u2019re working to find the right publishing partner to make that happen in as many regions and languages as possible. For the Kickstarter, we will only be offering the Sourcebook and the materials in English.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, and while we are excited to have Auroboros on Kickstarter so that you can be part of the development, delivering goods this way is still new to us. We want this to be a fantastic experience for you and we are hoping to fulfill this Kickstarter as quickly as possible. That being said, there are some risks that are out of our control and could impact our desired delivery timing. These include: Shipping, Customs and Production delays\n\nBy far, the biggest concern for us are shipping delays, as called out above. The global supply chain is catching up from its shutdown last year. If things continue to go the way they have been, we estimate that shipping will be back to pre-2020 efficiencies by the time we are shipping.\n\nOur second biggest concern is customs delays. We have been working with experts on Kickstarter shipping and fulfilment and received up to the minute advice on this complex and ever-changing environment. Our goal is to make this as friendly and easy for you as possible. However, this is our first Kickstarter and dealing with recent and upcoming VAT changes is frankly, new to everyone. There is a world that we missed something and because of that, we experience a customs delay. If that becomes reality, please know that we will do everything in our power to resolve the issue to expedite clearing customs.\n\nThe estimated delivery date for Auroboros is Q1 2022.

The adventurers are trapped in a strange land - can they find their way home? And can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dendelion? Illustrated by Egil Thompson.\n From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread. These creatures are inspired by Eastern European folklore. By Artem Serebrennikov; illustarted by Sade.\n Fearsome Critters. Writer John Bupp takes a look at a handful of fearsome fey critters! The small, apelike agropelter hurls branches from nearby trees; the infamous jackalope can mimic any sound it hears; the short, pudgy puckwudgie can be helpful, but a terrible foe if slighted; and the six-legged campus cat can terrify its prey with its mere gaze. Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\n Beasts of the Feywild. More summer means more fey! This time we have a bunch of new fey beasts for your 5E game - from the Dreaming Tree to the Sylvan Spaniel, from the Moon Horse to the Flower Mouse, these creatures from writer Jason Reilly are sure to enhance your game sessions! Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\nWe knew you'd want a list of the monsters in this book. They range from CR 0 to CR 11.\n Agropelter (CR 1). 3-ft. villainous ape-ducks able to hurl tree branches.\n Dreaming Tree (CR 5). A fey tree which feasts on the dreams of those sleeping nearby.\n Flower Mouse (CR 0). A tiny fey creature sometimes used as a mount by flower fey and faeries.\n Golden Goat (CR 1/4).

A rabbit... with antlers, and a talent for mimicry.\n Mirage Butterfly (CR 1/8). Mounts of the flower fey with minor illusion powers.\n Moon Horse (CR 2). The preferred mount of the Summer Court, this horse appears to be made of ivory.\n Ochoduchi (CR 6). An 8-ft tall horned goat humanoid with razorsharp claws, based on a monster from Georgian folklore.\n Poludnitsa (CR 4). A capricious trickster which adopts different guises, based on a creature from Polish, Russian, and Slovak folklore.\n Puckwudgie (CR 1/2). A short, grey-skinned shapeshifter, capable of good or evil.\n Samovila (CR 9). A tall winged fey of drought and harvest with otherworldy features which holds great power in the faerie courts; based on a creature from Serbian and Bulgarian folklore.\n Swarm of Flower Mice (CR 1/4). Flower mice are not dangerous alone, but can swarm their enemies.\n Swarm of Mirage Butterflies (CR 1/2). A swarm of mirage butterflies can combine their illusion powers to greater effect.\n Sylvan Manx (CR 0). These cats come and go as they please.\n Sylven Spaniel (CR 1/4).

A fetid-smelling six-legged black cat with a frightening gaze.\nBut if you buy this book for anything, buy it for the sylvan spaniel. How cute is this?\nIn addtion to the 18 fey monsters, Adventure Into The Feywild is a 15-page adventure by Kiel Chenier included in Into the Feywild. In this adventure for 1st-5th level characters the adventurers are trapped in a strange land\u2014can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dandelion, and find their way home?\nWhen it was originally released for EN5ider's 100th issue back in 2016, the included adventure got some glowing reviews.\n\"If you are comfortable improvising and roleplaying, this is one of the best and easiest modules to run. The charts are amazing, hilarious and lead to some truly great moments. I needed very little prep time which was much appreciated. I think my players will remember this session fondly for a long time.\"\n\"The random tables alone are incredible.  The adventure is great, too, but I'll be re-using these tables!\"\n\"My party loved this adventure so, so much. It's fun and flexible and gives you lots of chances to let your players determine the direction of the story. In particular, if you're comfortable tweaking the storyline based on the random roll events, it can take you to some really strange and exciting places that can absolutely resonate with your players.\"\nLet's take a quick peek inside!\nThis is the 11th in this series of mini-quickstarters.

Take grenadier feats to make black powder explosives with alchemical powers like the web grenade, hallucinogen grenade, or the ooze grenade! It takes a lot of effort stuffing an ooze into a hand-size iron shell, but hurl that thing into the midst of a pack of enemies and out pops a gelatinous cube, hungry to dissolve the nearest living thing in acid.\nAnd of course it wouldn\u2019t be a guide to golems without a Golemist specialization for the Artificer, able to build and command constructs of all shape and sizes from a variety of different materials, new stats for golem mooks and bosses for the GM, and new rules for a highly customizable golem race that\u2019s fully compatible with the other golem race whose name I probably shouldn\u2019t say because it\u2019s product identity. Play as a golem with the improved carrying capacity of a heavy frame, the improved movement speed of a light frame, the swim speed of an aquatic design, or some extra cantrips from your built-in mana engine.\nAnd that\u2019s not all! Mutagenic infusions! Annihilation grenades! Walking castles! Details to come in updates along the way.\nReward Levels\nThe importance of $1 backers can never be overstated. Kickstarter promotes projects based on number of backers, not the amount of money pledged, so if you want to help the project succeed but can't spare much money, $1 pledged on the first day can mean as much as $50 pledged on the final day. The success of this project is something I ultimately measure in backer count rather than money raised, so pledging $1 is a good way to support the series as a whole even if you're not so interested in this specific book.\nAt the $5 Blueprint Ink level, you get a digital copy of Bianca's Guide to Golems. A family commitment by my formatter means that you should expect this reward three weeks after the campaign's end rather than the usual two.\nAt the $12 Golem Ink level, you will get a physical softback copy of Bianca's Guide to Golems in addition to a digital copy.\nAt the $25 Ink of the Maker level, you will get a signed softback copy of Bianca's Guide to Golems in addition to a digital copy. This comes with a signature, a hand drawn aspect symbol of the aspect represented by the book (hand drawn by a guy who commissions all of his illustrations, so think of this more like a second signature than art), and a Roman numeral indicating exactly which signing of the book you received. Once we reach 100, there will never be another signed and symbol'd copy of the book (if you track me down at like a convention or something - whenever we start having those again - I'll still sign it for you, but only the first 100 get the symbol). Don't worry if you've missed one, as signed copies of previous books in the series are available as add-ons - up to the first hundred.\nAt the $50 Basic Golem level, your character's name will be attached to a golem, infusion, or spell in the book. Should you choose a golem at this level, it will be a mid-tier generic construct, like the bishop or knight constructs of the Order of the Third Eye or the Plumbum constructs made by Bianca, not a unique character (for that, you want the Advanced Golem).\nAt the $100 Advanced Golem level, a boss based on your character will be added to the book, along with a digital and signed physical copy. The action-oriented bosses of Bianca's Guide to Golems each come with five cinematic actions, including one ultimate attack that can only be used after the other four, resulting in bosses that are simultaneously intimidating to players, who never know what they'll do next, and also less likely to actually TPK anyone, because they can't spam their best attack over and over. Each boss comes with a brief background and personality. Standard caveats apply: Characters submitted must be appropriate to a general audience, not include hate speech, and must fit in with the book's theme (it could be an Artificer, a construct, an abjuration or transmutation focused caster, an ooze, or anything else related to these concepts).\nAt the $250 Ultimate Golem level, the most powerful boss in the book will be based on your character. Designed in the same style and theme as the $100 reward, this boss will be the ultimate challenge in Bianca's Guide.\nAt the $500 Golem Series level, an entire series of 3-7 golems designed by your character will be added to the book. The majority of the golems are standard mooks, but one or two are powerful boss fights.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000 - Bianca's Golems. By default, the 'zine will ship with the five golems of the Order of the Third Eye from Petals and Thorns. At this level, Bianca's seven golem models will be added, from the tiny crab-like Cuprum model to the large, construction-specialized Plumbum model, to the gregarious and battle-ready Stannum model used for her companion Tin'kan. These golems will be available both as statblocks for use as NPCs (some as mooks, some as bosses) and as craftable options for the new Golemist Artificer specialization.\n$2,000 - The Walking City of the Mana Kings. This is a description of a ruined empire of artificers and wizards whose entire society relied on golems and constructs, dripping with plot hooks and locations full of magical materials to plunder, including, somewhere out there, the deactivated remains of their city-golem, a massive miles-wide foundation supported on four titanic legs that once walked across the plains with the capital city built atop.\n$3,500 - Magic Item Shops. Magic-Mart, that is, a magic item shop that stocks an unlimited inventory of all magic items with sticker prices, is terrible. A few quick and sloppy limitations on Magic-Mart can help, but not much. Sometimes Magic-Mart only stocks magic items of a certain rarity, or they have a Schroedinger's inventory containing every magic item up until you hit their gp limit when suddenly they have no magic items. None of these are as satisfying as a magic shop with a curated inventory of specific magic items, and at the $3,500 stretch goal, Bianca's Guide to Golems will come with a dozen-ish such magic shops, with descriptions of the shop, shopkeeper, and a pre-selected inventory for a specific theme and tier of the game.\nContact\nYou can get in touch with me by messages on Kickstarter, by sending an email to chamomilehasa@gmail.com, or at my Discord.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm usually able to deliver these 'zines within two weeks of the Kickstarter campaign's conclusion.

He shares his projects on Instagram and YouTube. And now the time has come to do the next step. Together with his wife Marina, they decided to create Miniature Terrain Making Vol. 1.\nThe book contains a wide range of easy & effective techniques to get your terrain ideas on the gaming table. As well as chapters about advanced modeling techniques to make highly realistic terrain and scenery. Of course the book also includes inspirational pictures and exclusive terrain projects.\nBy joining this Kickstarter you receive more than 20 pages with printable templates that boost your crafting to the next level.\nTechniques & Materials\nModel making materials like foam, different types of foliage, or balsa wood. This section explains how you can use specific tools and materials effectively to create stunning looking terrain for your collection.\nThe following example shows different ways how you can make walls of XPS-Foam.\nTerrain Tutorials\nA SiFi battlefield, dramatic rock formations, a grimdark forest, ancient pyramids, or deadly swamps: Of course the book offers a great variety of projects, including detailed process descriptions.\nThis terrain for example is mostly made of cardboard. The tutorial illustrates techniques to make scenery using materials you already have at home. You can even use the packaging of the book and get started.\nTemplates\nTo simplify the building process you get 20 pages with templates of items like walls, windows, paving, or doors. You can print them and craft complex shapes that make your models look cutting-edge. The templates can be used in various ways and can be combined with different building techniques like layering cardboard or engraving foam. (More templates will get unlocked by reaching more stretch goals)\nGuest Articles\nOur first guest in the book is Michael from the well-known YouTube channel Tabletop Workshop (TWS). He is also the author of the famous book `Tabletop Terrain From XPS Foam \u2013 Buildings\u00b4. Michael will share some of his most improved techniques and tips exclusively for you.\nInspiring Terrain Pictures\nAnd of course, the book provides inspiring projects that have been crafted with patience and passion.\nThe goal is to keep this Kickstarter simple. The more backers participate, the more content you will receive. That means: More pages, more templates, and more extras!\nAll books will be delivered with tracking and priority.\nPlease note as well: Your pledge on Kickstarter covers your reward and shipping fee. The country-specific VAT and other taxes or import fees collected by the local authorities are not included!\nWe are planning to ship your copy of the book by December  2021. We will keep you updated!  Stay safe and healthy!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith her professional traits as an experienced graphic designer and artist Marina will create a unique book. \n\nPhilipp is fascinated about making terrain models for more than 25 years now.

Steamforged Games retains the right to sell these in the pledge manager and on the Steamforged website, as well as during conventions and as part of special promotions.\nIt\u2019s time to journey to an uncharted land, because the Astera basecamp needs YOU.\nBecome a hunter of the Fifth Fleet to track down and slay the fearsome monsters roaming the New World. Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts!\nBattle massive monsters in a wild open world.\nWith two complete core sets, playable standalone or together, you can embark on quests in two distinct habitats teeming with native beasts. \nAs you gain more experience, the monsters get tougher. Every beast has three difficulty levels to challenge your skills. Successfully slay a 4-star monster, and you\u2019ll win your campaign!\nWant a one-shot monster fight without the tracking? \nArena quests let you hunt any monster, at any difficulty level, using any hunters, right away. Simply equip your hunters with the recommended loadout and dive headfirst into the fight!\nExplore the lush Ancient Forest...\n\n...the arid Wildspire Waste...\n...or combine sets to expand your world!\nPlay with any combination of hunters and hunt any combination of monsters during your campaign. Because hunters can make equipment from other sets, combining sets opens up a whole new world of weapons and armour for your hunters to craft.\nFind out how the core sets combine\n\n\nBecause hunters are defined by their weapons, every hunter is a different way to play. Where the great sword hunter trades movement for raw strength, commanding respect with its incredible stopping power, the dual blades hunter favours swift strikes and mobility \u2014 dashing in with a flurry of blows before dodging to safety.\nSome video game weapons come with extra special features, like the charge blade and insect glaive. To really squeeze the juice from that Divineapple in the board game, those hunters come with special rules.\nThe monsters you hunt will determine which loot you earn and what weapons you can craft to help on your next quest. So, you\u2019ll need to decide together where to follow the Scoutflies next. \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a monster, track them through the lush Ancient Forest or arid Wildspire Waste using the choose-your-own-adventure quest book.\nImmerse yourself in the New World, gathering resources, avoiding health-sapping pitfalls, and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment.\nJust like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. The tracks you discover will determine what state you find the monster in, and which special attack is added to their deck.\nEnjoy the beauty of the landscape as you climb trees, scale cliffs, and explore caves for bonus resources \u2014 but don\u2019t get too distracted. Every quest has a time limit. As you hunt, you\u2019ll discard time cards, giving you less time to take down the beast when you eventually track it down...\nDiscover more about the Gathering Phase\nIt\u2019s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these! Every monster is a boss, and every boss is a unique challenge, with different ways of moving, different attack styles, and special rules that will trigger during battle to change things up.\nMonsters dictate the flow of battle, deciding who to target and even taking the first turn.\nLuckily, the more experience you gain, the better you\u2019ll get at predicting the monster\u2019s next move. As you learn their \u2018tells\u2019, the clues on the back of every behaviour card will give you a bigger hint at what\u2019s coming next.\nOnce the monster has made their move, it\u2019s your chance to react! Because these are wild beasts you\u2019re fighting, you won\u2019t always have the same opportunity to act before the monster moves again. \nYou\u2019ll need to decide who\u2019s best placed to attack, who needs to sharpen their weapon, and who needs to get the heck out of the way before the beast strikes again...\nDiscover more on Monster Behaviour\nYour position matters. Monsters have four arcs for their behaviours and their body parts: front, left, right, and rear. Where you\u2019re standing determines whether you\u2019ll get hit, but also what parts you can target.\nBreaking parts can trigger rules that change monster behaviour and earn bonus loot for your whole party, which you can use to craft upgraded weapons for taking on tougher beasts.\nWhen you\u2019re taking on a monster, three things are vital to success: positioning, teamwork, and managing your cards.\nThere are no dice in combat. Instead, combat is controlled by cards which you\u2019ll use to create combos, meaning you\u2019ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina.\nBecause attack cards can also be used for movement and dodging attacks, which also uses stamina slots, you\u2019ll need to make strategic choices about when to play cards and when to keep your board clear.\nKeep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!\nDiscover more on How Hunters Work\n Craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles, swapping cards into your deck to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks.\nChecking potential rewards is key to choosing your next monster quest. Some equipment offers elemental damage and resistance which could help you in a future hunt.\nBecause everything you craft stays in your inventory, switch equipment between quests to give you the best chance against the next beast!\nYou\u2019ll start with a unique attack deck based on your hunter\u2019s weapon and upgrade options you can craft from bone and ore. The more monster loot you claim, the better your weapon choices become!\nDiscover more on Upgrading Your Hunter\nLike the video game, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game is a campaign game. Over multiple sessions, you\u2019ll face tougher monsters, upgrading your hunter and equipment as you go.\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt \u2014 until you\u2019re ready to take on a 4-star monster and win your campaign!\nWith 25 campaign days to spend (more if you're playing with combined sets), you'll need to make strategic choices about which monster to hunt and when. \nWill you hunt tougher versions of the same monster to craft all the weapons you can? Or try a fresh challenge?\nAfter a heart-pounding hunt, you may want to kick back and relax. Spend a few campaign days at HQ visiting the Smithy to craft new equipment, petting the Poogie, and enjoying a meal whipped up by the Meowscular Chef!\nHow Hunters Work\nTracking Monsters\nMonster Behaviour\nUpgrading Your Hunter\nArena Quests \n Combining the Core Sets\n   We\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs. Depending on where you are in the world, your rewards will be sent to you from our hub in either the UK, USA, Netherlands, China, or Australia.\nBelow are rough estimate costs for shipping a Core pledge. The prices shown are best estimates based on current rates but please be aware that global shipping prices are currently very volatile due to COVID-19 and Brexit. Once the campaign is finished and you\u2019ve confirmed your address and any add-ons, your accurate shipping cost will be calculated in the pledge manager.\n\n\n\nSadly, due to customs, import laws, and other restrictions, Steamforged is unable to ship pledge rewards to these locations (see point 10 of terms).\nBecause of the size of the package, we\u2019re also unable to ship to P.O. Boxes.\nKeep in mind that any pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from our UK hub at a later date. For non-UK backers, this will likely increase shipping costs.\nFor the regions listed as \u2018friendly shipping\u2019, we cover any VAT or sales tax charges. So, those are accounted for in the pledge price and shipping estimations. \nBackers in other regions will be liable for any VAT or sales taxes which may be applied in their own countries. There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin. Because circumstances are different from project to project, this timeline is estimated based on our experience.\n We want to get your rewards into your hands as soon as possible. Because of the potential for unexpected effects on planning and production schedules, there\u2019s a chance you might not get your rewards before the game is available at retail.

While they might be first time designers, \"Ani\" is a long-time employee of Queen games as a graphic designer, and we are very excited to be adding them to our arsenal of published designers. Check out this Designer Diary video they have have on the making of Scrap Racer.\nPreviews and Live Plays\nGame Play\nScrap Racer is a push-your-luck dice game that is suitable for novice gamers or seasoned veterans looking for a raucous experience.\nYou are a daredevil Scrap Racer who knows only one goal: Win the race\u2014no matter how dangerous!\n\n\n A race lasts for three laps, and whomever leads the field at that point will be the winner. \nOn a turn, the active player rolls up to six dice (one at a time) and advances their racer according to the results. But be careful! If you roll doubles, you must draw a crash card and anything can happen\u2014depending on the double you may get a boost or be slowed down, letting others catch up. However, you can gain bonus cards for repeated doubles that can make up for lost position, if used correctly.\nUsing the unique abilities of the racers and collecting Boost markers, the players can manipulate the outcome of the race to their advantage. On top of all of this, players may have to fight for track position. Whenever two racers share the same space, a duel takes place to decide who will advance by one space and who will stay.\nWhen a racer crosses the finish line, a Goal Card is drawn which will advance the racers in the back, ensuring a photo finish.\n\nAdd On\nWe have published one other game by a Queen Games employee\u2014Orcs Orcs Orcs by Frank Thyben (lead developer).  Backers in the United States may add this game on to their order for special pricing during the campaign.\nClick for more game information\n\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Scrap Racer is planned for May 2021. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse.

In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\n\nPost Campaign Communication\nWe will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions.

These are more refinements than radical changes. If you are only playing Mythic Battles: Pantheon, you can either use them or ignore them, because remember, it's YOUR game!\n-Talents&Terrain types\nSeveral talents and terrains are not included in MBR. In order to maintain a balance with the new talents, some talents from MBP have had their frequency of appearance on MBR profiles greatly reduced, or are even absent altogether, such as Phalanx.\nSome terrains and boundaries have disappeared like Swamp or Chains, while others have been added like Divine Source. Others have simply undergone a name change, such as Lava which becomes Burning. Rules for terrain types and boundaries not listed in the MBR rulebook remain fully valid on the boards where they were normally played. \n-Ascend\nWe were not satisfied with the way climbing was handled in relation to rock type terrain, we felt it too restrictive. So we created a fourth complex action, Ascend, which allows a unit to enter a Rock terrain type area if that unit starts its move in an adjacent area (regardless of its move stat). It becomes possible to ascend the rock but starting its movement next to the rock terrain type and losing access to some powers and talents because of having performed a complex action. The Climb talent remains a safe bet since it still allows you to go entera rocky terrain with a simple step, it also allows you to enter cliff type terrain, and can cross escarpment type borders. In addition, a unit with Climb gains +1 defence when on a Rock against any attack from a unit without this skill.\n-1V1V1 change\n3-player games used to end when a deity had absorbed 4 Divine stones or was the last one alive on the battlefield. While it allowed for the creation of fortunate alliances, it did not encourage risk-taking and left the first loser out for the rest of the game. The 3 player games now end the same way as the 2 or 4 player games. Players who prefer the previous version will definitely want to play it anyway.\n-Titan vs God\nThis option is back on the scene to allow for as many different confrontations as possible, exploring even more themes. Titans tend to be scary because of their raw power, which is hard to handle, especially in your first few games, and so the only option was that they were forced to fight each other.\nThe confrontation between titans and gods is once more possible, by offering the side that DOES NOT recruit a titan, a bonus, that player gets to deploy a unit for free, like a troop unit or a unit with the Scout talent including (if they wish to) their god.\nThis allows many options, such as blocking the path of an opponent's unit, advancing a unit to quickly get divine stones, or placing your god so that he doesn't lose any of his precious activations to deploy and keeps them to attack or absorb divine stones. This extra move also restores the balance of stress on the titan player's side, as you'll have to deal with enemies with a slight edge.\n-Rune\nIn MBP, omphalos could be used to recover vitality. Here, runes can be used to increase the effective combat value. If victory by absorbing four divine stones is slipping away from your prospects, you can always seek glory in a desperate assault on the opposing deity. And, if you miss, perhaps, you're getting a little too close.\n-Absorption according to the pantheon of origin\nIn the past, it was the origin of the deity (Greek, Norse) that decided whether you could enjoy the special power of a divine stone or not. For example, if Thor collected omphalos, he could not use the special power of it because he was not a Greek deity. This added a thematic imbalance, but it was still an imbalance. Now, each type of divine stone allows all deities to enjoy its benefit. Thor could benefit from the omphalos, which he would normally absorb, and Zeus would do the same for the runes. So the scenario or board you play on will decide what bonus you can have, and not discriminate against pantheons.\nMythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k and Mythic Battles: Pantheon play separately but can also be played together. Whether you prefer to see Ares and Tyr in a deadly duel or see their martial prowess displayed under the same banner, the choice is yours. You just have to use Mythic Battle: Ragnar\u00f6k rules and include any talent or terrain type which is not part of Mythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k corebox and add it to the rules.\nIn its final form, the rulebook will contain an additional section on this topic with arbitration on rule points that might be problematic in very specific situations and add terrain and skills from Mythic Battles: Pantheon that have not made their way to the frozen lands.\nNo need for any kit, pack or add-on if you want to mix the two games.

For some destinations, the fees are still high, but they are the only ones we have been able to obtain that meet our requirements.\nThe shipping costs in the table below are very reliable estimates that will vary by a maximum of a few dollars (up or down). They take into account certain taxes such as VAT as well as the annual inflation of logistics costs, and the Stretch Goals.\nIndeed, contrary to other Kickstarters, our shipping fees estimates are not fees that don\u2019t include the Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign, but the estimates INCLUDE the Stretch Goals that could be unlocked. The estimates are therefore the high end of the fees you could pay, and not the other way around.\nWe regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes, and to following countries:  Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Syria, Russia,  Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

In the beginning, while in Midgard men spread, the gods only had Valhalla; until a stranger came along and offered his services, boasting that he could build them such a fortress in exchange for the Moon, the Sun, and Freyja. The gods hesitated but finally agreed, on condition that the work be completed in a single winter, before the first day of summer, and that no hand would help him. The Master Builder then asked that his horse, Svadilfari, be left as his assistant; this was agreed to at the instigation of Loki, who did not think for a minute that he would be able to do it. But the gods were surprised. The horse could bear heavy loads, more than any other; and the stranger, methodical and talented, built, stone by stone, a wall higher and thicker. Three days before the beginning of the summer, he had only the door to place on the fort to finish the work. Worried, the gods gathered and decided that Loki, who had made the agreement, must find a solution or face their wrath. That evening, while the Master Builder was out looking for stones, a beautiful mare (which was Loki) came to distract the stallion, who did not want to work anymore and ran after him. The Master Builder could not get hold of his horse for three days, and lost his bet. Mad with rage, he denounced the treachery, entering into a black anger while transforming himself into a j\u00f6tunn. The gods, seeing that they had dealt with a giant, considered that they owed him nothing and ordered Thor to kill him, which he did willingly.

Now you can track status, spells, hit points, initiative and others, allowing all players to understand, at a single glance, the game situation quickly and easily.  \n\n100% compatible\nAnd if you already have miniatures with a standard 1-inch base* (2.54cm), the interactive bases are compatible with those too!\n\n* We tested the basis with all the major lines of miniatures: Wizkids, Frostgrave, Zealot, Blacklist (just to name a few): bases fit all perfectly!\n\nThe tags present in the greatest number are \"numbers\". They are in blue and red colors. You can use them in many ways: hit points, initiative, ability buffs or debuffs, number of turns, etc.\n\nWhat's better than casting a spell, like \"Arcane Shield\" and see it directly linked to your miniature? But that is not all! Spell models also stand up on their own, so you can summon them to spaces away from the character as well.\n\nThis is one of the best parts: you can also show the conditions of your character and opponents! whether they are poisoned, deafened, charmed, or regenerating, no problem: you will have them all!\n\nYea! they can have a dual function: to signal the use of a particular fighting style for that game turn, or, if associated with similar models, to identify which of them has a melee weapon from who has a long-range one. \n\nand many new ones are on the way!\n\nThe interactive system is not the only innovation of this project. Together with it, we offer a line of miniatures printed in high-quality plastic! \nTheir design is made in collaboration with the Italian artists Claudio Casini and Simone Rasetti.\nToo many miniatures to paint? no problem!\nGame Start has obtained the license to use the Sundrop technique on the miniatures of this line (the same used for the Awaken Realms miniatures), thus giving everyone the possibility to have pre-shaded models with a technique that highlights the details.\n\nSundrop consists of coloring the models with strong contrasts of light and dark, giving the models a unique \"old style\" effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe images proposed in the photo gallery below were made using the models painted in Sundrop and the proposed addon \"Fantasy World Creator - Essential Edition\". \nThe visual result is that of playing an adventure on an old-fashioned picture book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketed and Promoted by\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox, the tech marketing company behind many successful Kickstarters.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign, all previous \"World Creator\" projects have been supported and delivered successfully.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the six months window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. We do not intend to allow this to happen for this project, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge. Suppose you confirm your pledge within six months of our notification via email: in that case, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by standard methods. Shipping costs may vary from what is indicated in the \"Shipping\" section, as they will be applied next year and therefore may be subject to increases.

Now we\u2019re doing the dragons.\nWelcome to 7 Moons: Heroes of Dragon Reach\n7 Moons is an original family board game from Gunpowder Studios, set in a mythical, magical world of dragons and monsters, where 1-4 players seek to save the beautiful kingdom of Dragon Reach from the impending Shadow Army. \nThe story of Dragon Reach, the magical kingdom in which 7 Moons is set, is woven richly into the game, giving players an immersive experience with them at the heart of the adventure.\nThe standard game is packed with high-quality components, engaging stories and enchanting locations. It's got some neat game mechanics too, and like all of our games, 7 Moons can be played by anyone from 8 to 80  and enjoyed by novice and experienced game players alike. And if you're into even more bling for your buck, check out our DELUXE PLEDGE. \n* Coins will be cast in metal and embossed (not printed) for a real-coin feel. The KS deluxe edition coins will additionally feature an exclusive 'KS' mark on each coin. Retail versions of the deluxe edition will not feature the KS coin mark. Designs may be subject to change prior to production.\nIf you wish to pledge a little more towards our target, we'll send you a deluxe version of the game, filled with even more goodness: real metal shiny Dragon Reach coins and proper wooden playing pieces to replace some of the cardboard tokens in the standard game. \nPlus Story Tokens\nTo show our appreciation to everyone who helped us get 7 Moons funded, we're going to be adding a new optional game feature: the 7 Moons story tokens, which will bring more adventure, replayability and fun to the game. We'll be including the tokens in the printed game, and providing the print and play rules online for free.\nPlus solo gaming for all!\nSolo Gaming is now included in all games. Play 7 Moons as a solo adventurer using our specially designed single-player AI rules. Experience all the elements of the multiplayer game and try to save Dragon Reach as a lone emissary. \nThe challenge of 7 Moons is to get your city's defences ready before the Shadow Army arrives and attacks. You have very little time, and there are many ways to raise gold to build strongholds and recruit allies, so your choices are important factors in your success or failure in protecting your city - and the whole realm - from the marauding hordes of evil creatures heading your way - fast.   \nHeavyweight, illustrated character cards hold your resources and provide a handy game reference. You set out from your city on foot, but pretty soon you'll need to buy a horse so that you can carry more gear and get around faster. Better still, lure a friendly(ish) local dragon and then you'll really be flying. \n7 Moons plays simply and smoothly, but is enough of a challenge to keep you entertained and focused, game after game. That's another hallmark of every Gunpowder game: we keep our game mechanics and rules deliberately simple so that you can concentrate on your game plan and how you're going to win. \nQuests are a great way to swell your coffers and gain allies to fight for your city, but they're risky and take precious time you may be reluctant to spare. Fail, and you'll have nothing to show for your efforts. Succeed, and the rewards will have been worth the time and trouble. \nVenturing into the Dragon Reach wilderness is foolhardy, dangerous and often very rewarding. You can also travel through the wilderness to reach destinations faster, though bandits may relieve you of your gold, and your dragon may decide to flee. But if a risky short cut means getting your resources to market before the other players to beat them to the highest price, it could be a risk worth taking. \n7 Moons requires a fine balance of gameplay as it nears its end game: the attack of the Shadow Army. As your city grows stronger, the Shadow Phase draws closer. But while it may be tempting to get your defences in place as quickly as possible, if your fellow players are far from ready when the Shadow Army attacks, you put the whole realm at risk of defeat. Then again, you don't want to be the one who's still building their first stronghold when chaos descends on Dragon Reach. \nAny one of these diabolical legions could spell doom for a city. Wave after wave of foul creatures will test your decision-making and strategy in the final showdown.\nWe don't scrimp on components because we know that one of the most fun things about getting a new board game is opening the box to reveal the abundance of treasures crammed inside.\n\n7 Moons: Heroes of Dragon Reach is a game packed with adventure - a game of travelling, trading and preparing for the war that approaches. For 1-4 players aged 8 and up\nBack of the box  \nView larger image\nCustom playing pieces\n7 Moons comes with  25 originally designed wooden meeples, including foot traveller, horse and dragon in four player colours, a Shadow Army token and 12 wooden strongholds. The rest of the components are made from heavyweight card, including a thick game board depicting the lands of Dragon Reach and its four great cities. Quest and wilderness cards are vividly printed on high-quality stock, with engaging narratives for a fully immersive experience.\nLots of chunky tokens\nWe all love tokens, right? 7 Moons comes with over 100 resource tokens for wood. stone and iron, plus the special dragon crystals (should you discover them). There are also larger components for the magic artefacts hidden within the game, so that everyone can see when you've got one of the game's rare special treasures in your possession. Behold, my Sword of Alliance!\nSimple rules, smart gameplay and plenty of ways to win\nWell written, easy to follow 12-page rulebook with quick-start rules and clear referencing (see full rules link below)\nRules\nClick here to see a preview of the rules: View rules preview. We've playtested the game thoroughly, including breaking it several times until we were happy that it was going to withstand the rigours of play in the real world, especially for our loyal backers who put their faith in it making into the real world in the first place. But we'll continue refining the rules before we go to print, so that they're as unbreakable as a stone giant's pickaxe by the time you receive your copy.   \n One flat-rate shipping cost and fast delivery\n* For selected countries, we have negotiated delivery of each game direct from the manufacturer for a super low price. We will deliver your game to any of the following countries for one flat fee of \u00a310 (or your local currency equivalent): Australia, Canada, China, United Kingdom, USA (Alaska and Hawaii may incur additional costs) and the European Union. Delivery to other countries is available: see shipping costs at checkout.\nFlat-rate shipping also reduces the delivery time to you - packed, tracked and delivered to your door asap for one low price.\nSafe passage\nWhen your game is ready to ship it will be professionally packaged and sealed, then sent using a fully traceable tracking system direct from the factory to your door, as straight and swift as an elven arrow.\nThat's the plan!

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art. This version will be released shortly after we have sent our files to the printer and you'll have access to it before the physical copies have been delivered.\n Warrior: $50 (plus shipping)All of the benefits of both the Whisperer and the Tinkerer plus you'll get one full color hard cover edition and access to all Stretch Goals.

You pay for the shipping for your copy and we'll pay for the shipping to the reservation copy.\n Scout: $150 (plus shipping) For Friendly Local Games Stores Only. With this pledge you'll receive 6 copies of Coyote and Crow (1 case). You'll receive these at the same time as other Kickstarter backers, in advance of the general release.\n Seeker: $400 (plus shipping) (ALL GONE) For those that really want to support Coyote and Crow! All of the benefits of the Whisperer, Tinkerer, Warrior and Healer pledges, but your book will be signed and numbered by Connor Alexander. You'll also receive three high quality art prints of art used in the book (which ones, to be determined). This level is limited to 50 backers.\nIt still hungers. Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

The next adventures will be \"Victorian Iron\" Steampunk Adventure, and Sci-Fi Corridors. Now let's visit Deep Earth! \nFunctional Elevator! - See below\n PLEASE NOTE:  All Terrain models in this project are digital STL files only. There are no physical terrain pieces. Designed primarily for FDM printers. \nStackable Terrain adds a huge new playing area to your table! \n 4\"x4\"x4\" modules give you a playable cut-away view of corridors running through a mountain mining facility. Complete with stairs, elevators, trap doors, and secret rooms, it is a whole new experience. \nAdd a massive new playing area to your terrain!\n   Features: \n Multilevel traps and mechanisms. New game-play mechanics with open shafts, falling rocks, and machinery.\nLittle did the unsuspecting Burglar know, that the rock dropper had been alerted!\n Save Table space. Our stackable terrain is only 4\" wide. Run it along the edge of the table with your existing terrain to create a huge new playing area. Of course, you can use it as the main feature on the table as well by using the inside and outside corners to create a massive complex. \n Will not fall over.  Modules are designed to accept stainless steel table clips (optional) that hold the modules firmly in place along the edge of the table. Available on our fulfillment store. \n Spectacular lighting! - Option 1: Remote control 30mm Light Pod ports are designed into each 4\"x4\" module.

(Optional, magnets are not required, but we highly recommend them for super quick construction and stability.) 3mmx5mm round magnet slots are designed into each module to hold them firmly together adding to the stability of the wall. Stack several stories high, super easy set-up and tear-down. (Magnets not included. Available on our fulfillment store.)  \n FDM printing looks great on these mine walls!\nWhile resin printing creates a smoother surface we were pleasantly surprised to see the carved look that came out on the walls using FDM printing. In fact we actually prefer it!\nCheck out the cool carved effect using FDM printing.\nFree Stuff - Have a cart full of gold on us! \nThe \"Ancient Kings Wall Skin\" Download Is Available For All.\nThe wall skin is a good place to start.

Check it out in the Add-Ons.\nSee Add-ons for limited painting requests\n Save Big On Printing Time & Material!\n Attention to minimal 3d printing and supports. We have designed a unique core module that accepts a 3mm thick skin on the floor, wall and ceiling. Instead of printing out the entire module every time, you simply print the 3mm thick skins. This allows a variety looks by overlaying different skins on the same core module. Nearly all of the prints are support free.\n Secret Area Screen - (design in process)\n (Included in Core Pack). Your players will never know what's behind the secret area until it's time. Finished version will be a textured design (without secret area lettering)\n  When will this ship?\nScheduled file release is June 2021. We have tested all the prints and everything is printing nicely. However, we will still work with our beta testers printing on different printers to vet the designs. We may take a little additional time after the project to fine tune individual components to make them retail ready. If you have experience as a Beta Tester and would like to participate let us know in the KS message system. \n Tidbits:  \nPrint time. - We could not stop printing! Each time we built a level we wanted to add more. We finally had to stop to get this KS out early in the year. Our build took two months of printing using between 2-3 FDM printers night and day. Two printers went down, and two new Sovol SV01 printers were purchased. Things went much smoother from there. We are very happy with our SV01's. Miniatures were printed with our Epax 4k resin printer.\nPreferred FDM material came down to Hatchbox Silver or grey. The consistency and strength seemed to be very reliable. Least useful FDM was some of the more the brightly colored materials as it ended up being very brittle.\nPaint time. - One month of painting, then another couple weeks of printing and painting in the studio for fine tuning once we were ready to film.  \nWe were going to release 3 themes originally. - The Rock Theme \"Ancient Mines\", a Victorian Iron Steam Punk theme, and a Sci-fi Theme. What was interesting about that was mixing and matching the skins from different eras for unique looks. However, once we started shooting the  Rock Mine we realized it was just too massive for one KS.  We will release those in a separate KS project later this year.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th Kickstarter, thank you again to all our return and new backers! \n\nWe have been manufacturing products since 2005 and so we are very familiar with manufacturing, delivery and customer service. This project, however, is a little different as it includes digital STL files and 1 physical product, the Fog Monster 2. The good news is, it is a much faster turn around than creating new physical products! Fog Monster 1 was first produced in 2018 and FM2 is currently being distributed, so it is easy for us to do another production run on this physical product as all the molds are made. We are making a new production run for this KS to allow backers to use the fog FX in the terrain. \n\nWe have been 3d printing on resin and FDM printers for 7 years and absolutely love it! We have had many requests from our backers to release 3d print files for our projects and now we are happy to be able to do so. We have been testing and refining our files for over 3 months and they are in ready condition. We may add some addition features and textures during and after the KS. \n\nWe are continuing to make refinements as we receive feedback from beta testers and once we believe the files are \"retail ready\" they will be released. We do not anticipate any hold ups but, as always, there may be a few troublemakers in the bunch. We have years of experience to easily solve any problems we may run into.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are focused on saving time and money on printing materials by creating a unique \"Skinning System\".

Photography by The ESC Plan.\nProject Fulfillment\nBlacklist Games, LLC is proud to announce that we have once again partnered with Quartermaster Logistics (QML) for fulfillment for this project.\nQML has an outstanding reputation for their transparent and stellar customer service, allowing for backers to get freight/shipping updates and personable QA solutions directly from them. They have high standards when it comes to ensuring packages are delivered with enough protection and care to give backers and publishers peace of mind. We have been pleased with their performance in the past, and continue to have the utmost confidence in their ability to successfully fulfill our projects.\nShipping\nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after this Kickstarter campaign concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager (see the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d section below for more details). This is because shipping varies from region to region.\nFriendly Shipping & Taxes/Fees\nPledge rewards shipping to one of our \"friendly\" zones will be delivered with no additional customs, duties, or taxes (including VAT).\nPledge rewards shipped to a location outside of these zones can be subject to taxes, customs, and duties according to the destination country\u2019s regulations/legislation. It is the responsibility of the recipient of the order to pay for any such additional fees.\nShipping Hubs\nDepending on which region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for UK backers), Germany (for EU backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world).\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping pledges to various regions.\nIMPORTANT: These estimates are based on the weight of the main products in a pledge and an average weight regarding possible unlocked content. Additionally, these estimates do not take into consideration the weight of any optional add-ons you purchase. Therefore, actual shipping costs may be more due to increased package weight from both the final amount of unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional add-ons you have\nPO BOXES\nPlease note we cannot deliver to P.O. boxes.\nEXCLUDED SHIPPING REGIONS\nUnfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter.\nBREXIT\n                                                 Quartermaster Logistics is opening a fulfillment center in Germany in order to continue to allow us and others to offer EU-friendly shipping post-Brexit.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the following terms and conditions.\nFinal Product\nProducts shown on this Kickstarter page are subject to change. Therefore, the final products you receive may differ from what is presented here.\nProject Updates\nIt is your responsibility as a backer of this project to read project updates in order to stay up to date with important details and requests from the Blacklist Games team.\nCommunicating with Blacklist Games After the Campaign\nPlease note that we do not monitor the Kickstarter messaging inbox outside of a live Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, after this project has ended, please ensure to communicate with us via https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/help\nRefund Policy\nFull refunds are available within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end date. All refunds taking place within these 14 days are reversed in full via Stripe to your credit card.\nAfterwards, refunds minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recuperate) will be available before and during the first 30 days the pledge manager is open. Once these initial 30 days have passed, no refunds will be possible. A reminder of the refund cutoff date will be announced in project updates.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed as previously stated.\nThis Campaign Is Not A Store\nAny amounts pledged to this campaign are contributions meant to help bring the project to life. For your contribution, we are providing you with rewards for your support. In other words, this campaign is not a store and you are not making a purchase. Therefore, if you are interested in receiving rewards for your contribution, you must complete your pledge manager by its closing date after the campaign ends. If you do not, we cannot guarantee you will receive rewards for your pledge. We may, at our discretion, choose to provide anyone who did not complete their pledge manager by its deadline with a second chance to get the rewards relating to their pledge level, depending on availability of stock (see \u201cCompleting the Pledge Manager\u201d section below for more details).\nCompleting the Pledge Manager\nIn the weeks following the conclusion of the campaign, an email invitation will be sent to all backers to allow them entry to the pledge manager; further details on this process will be provided in a project update published around the same time the email invites are sent out.\nBackers must confirm their \u201corder\u201d (pledge rewards + purchased add-ons) in our pledge manager before its closing date in order to receive their order. \u201cConfirming your order\u201d means entering your valid shipping information and paying any balances due for shipping costs and selected add-ons in the pledge manager.\nIf you confirm your order by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your confirmed order as entered into the pledge manager. That title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d as a pledge for this Kickstarter that wish to receive rewards after the campaign has ended must make sure to select rewards in the pledge manager and confirm their order by the closing date of the pledge manager. All remaining \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the closing date of the pledge manager has passed.\nIf you do not confirm your order before the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payments/donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, agree to place you on a waiting list for backers with unconfirmed orders if you contact us after the closing date of the pledge manager but before fulfillment of rewards begins. Backers on this list will be contacted once initial fulfillment to backers has concluded in order to offer them a final chance to complete their orders; note that this process would not involve the pledge manager and that any shipments sent as a result of this process would not benefit from any \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d rates offered during the Kickstarter campaign and would undoubtedly be shipped at a higher cost due to not benefitting from overall Kickstarter shipping rates. We also cannot guarantee the availability of add-ons/exclusive items in sufficient quantity at that point in time.\nRetailer Eligibility\nTo qualify as a retailer, you will need to provide proof of owning a legitimate, active brick and mortar hobby/games/media retail store. You will also be asked to provide your business license and/or proof of registration with your government\u2019s tax authority. Failure to provide this information will result in being unable to confirm your retail order and you will only have access to standard backer pricing in the pledge manager.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing several successful crowdfunding campaigns (some fulfilled, some in various states of fulfillment), we are confident in our ability to bring you a quality product. Please see the campaign details above for our current estimated delivery date; note that due to this project being manufactured in China, delays can occur. Additionally, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards at different times.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with crowdfunding campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, with our strong relationship with our manufacturer, a fulfillment company already signed on and, most importantly, dedication to our backers and their satisfaction, we have no reason to doubt this campaign will move along as smoothly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Lasting Tales Tier", "descp": "Get the Lasting Tales core book!\nINCLUDES:\nLasting Tales Hardcover Core Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["344 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Fantasy: Series 2 Tier", "descp": "Get the Fantasy: Series 2 miniatures set, and the Fantasy: Series 2 Stretch Goals!

It has allowed us to stay connected with friends and family, and even meet new friends as we've adapted our in-person games to a more virtual setting.\nWe decided to start Epic Dice Designs with the goal of introducing more people to the games that we love, and bring to life our own design concepts framed around stories and characters.  We want to share Epic Dice Designs with the world, and to do that, we are looking for your support to ramp up production and bring our first concept to life, the Heavy Metal Collection: Volume 1!\nThere are a total of 21 different set styles included in the collection, with an additional 9 sets waiting to be unlocked and different funding levels.\n\nDICE FEATURES\nThese sets are 25% heavier and 25% larger in size than standard dice\nDice are die-cast zinc alloy metal then coated in color enamel\nThese are perfect for any RPG such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, Savage World, Math Games, or anything else you can think of\nNumbers are large for easy reading, number 6's and 9's are clearly marked\nQuality Inspected: every die is inspected by hand before being packaged so that you only get the best\nIf you receive defective dies or missing dies set, please contact us for replacement\nLifetime Warranty\nSo which, Hero, Villain, or Creature will you choose...\nBARBARIAN'S BLOOD BATH  \nBarbarians are mighty fighters, with preponderance for senseless violence and an inbuilt blood lust. They are ruthless and fearless, qualities that make them much sought after to act as mercenaries by various unscrupulous factions and armies on the theory that it is much better to have them on one\u2019s own side than to stand and fight against them. Having said that it is better not to mix with them at all for as their name implies they have no caring for any type of society or its rules and social graces.\nThey are proficient with any and all types of weapon. They wear any armor they can afford or lay their hands on. They wear no uniform nor carry any banner. Many are cruel in their nature as their style of weaponry tends to show. Never make the mistake of attempting to befriend a Barbarian. They have no concept of friendship or of loyalty. If you offer a Barbarian the hand of friendship they are more likely to cut it off rather than shake it.\n\nBARD'S BALLAD \nBards sing songs and many of these songs are ballads that tell stories of long forgotten battles and heroes, bringing their memories back to a listening audience who are inspired by such tales of heroism and bravery. Such songs can be dangerous and have been known to raise arguments and even create wars between different factions who feel they have been libeled in such stories. However it is not just the music that makes a Bard a powerful character. \nJust because a Bard is a musician do not assume they are a pushover in a fight. A Bard has survived many bar room fights and they are very proficient with their fists and with both long and short daggers.\n\nBEHOLDER'S GAZE \nA Beholder is a monstrous aberration, a nightmare to behold. In fact nightmares are preferable. It is a large, grotesque. floating, round creature with a huge fanged mouth above which is a large central eye. On its top, appearing like the tentacles of a sea creature, are a number of twisted and turning stalks with an eye set into the end. \nThe creature is even more fearsome when you realize that each of these eyes is capable of releasing a number of different magical spells. It is capable of creating such spells as disintegrate objects, turn flesh to stone, deep sleep, slow the motion of objects or beings, charm animals and humans, cause death, induce fear, levitate objects, and inflict serious wounds, to name just a few. The list is endless and to make matters worse, the Beholder is constantly evolving and creating new and more deadly spells.\n\nCLERIC'S CHAOS\nA Cleric has  the inborn ability to straddle two worlds, the world of humans and the world of the gods. Clerics serve as many different Gods as there are religions, and sometimes they serve more than one God within a particular religion. Similar to a Monk, a Cleric has been encompassed by a particular religion and has been taught and trained inside a temple or monastery over many years and has been indoctrinated into its ways and beliefs. During the more advanced elements of this training the Cleric becomes imbued with a divine magic that has been passed down from their Gods via the monastery\u2019s religions elders.\nThis divine magic can be used in many different ways, depending on the type of spell the Cleric chooses to cast. They can be healing spells, or spells that can cause an enemy great harm. They can be spells that raise morale among allies and bless them with an inspiration that creates supreme endeavors in battle. Equally they can curse the enemy, they can bring down plague or illness on them, they can cast a dread that will freeze and petrify warriors, helping to turn the course of any on-coming battle.\n\nCREATURE OF THE DEEP\nThe Creature of the Deep is a creature with a humanoid shape covered with the scaly skin of a snake. The Creature lives at the bottom of the oceans and has been known to use rivers to travel inland. They are dangerous and use their claws as weapons to scratch and scourge their enemies. They also use a three pronged trident in conjunction with a large net that entraps their enemy. They also use these implements to hunt and catch fish and other small sea creatures.\nCreatures of the Deep do not ignore mankind. In some lonely coastal areas they come ashore and will trade and communicate with members of the local population. However never allow a creature of the deep to imbibe alcohol. It affects them very badly and causes them to become violent.\n\nCRYPTID'S KEEPER\nWhen Cryptids appear anywhere on the surface of the planet they cause consternation, destruction and mayhem. They carry no weapons, they have no need for weapons, these creatures use the power of their very beings and bodies to kill randomly. They are large and heavily armored by a toughened skin making them extremely difficult to kill.\nNo one knows very much about the Cryptid's life cycle or how they come to breed, or know if such a variety of strange and deadly creatures live alone or in colonies. Perhaps each different creature has a different lifestyle. No one knows anything other than they are deadly and their appearance heralds nothing but extreme danger.\n\nDRAGON'S DOMAIN\nFew people have actually seen one in the air but those that have will never forget the sight. Its scaly body shimmers and reflects the light appearing like a giant rainbow in the sky. Its wingspan is the size of a small village with a mighty tail that tapers to a fine point. It has talons sharper than the keenest blade and teeth that can cut through anything it bites. Its breath is hot, so hot that it can singe someone standing in front of it.\nThey are wise, especially to the ways of men. A dragon mates for life and is faithful to their partner. Both sexes share an equal responsibility for looking after the eggs and the hatchlings.  Once the young have reached an age of five years they leave the nest to establish a colony elsewhere.  As to the gold? The only gold a dragon sits on is the gold of their eggs, the future of dragon kind. \n\nDRUID'S DEMOLITION\nDruids are one of the oldest races on the planet and have watched the growth of mankind from deep within their green woodland sanctuaries. As the world of man expands the Druids sink deeper and deeper into their woodlands, guarding ancient sacred sites, protecting and preserving as best they can. It is believed, but not proven that some Druids have mastered the art of transformation into an animal form.\nDruids carry a long dagger and a curved sickle. These are used for gathering and cutting plants and small branches, however they can be used as very effective weapons. Their weapon of preference is a crude staff similar in looks to the old fashioned quarter staff. A great natural magic is embedded within this staff, a natural magic that has taken the holder many years of learning and practice to master. The staff is decorated with small totems such as a badger or bird skull dressed with leaves and feathers. Each one is personalized to their particular Druid and anyone attempting to use it, even another Druid, will end up in a very bad way...\n\nGOBLIN'S GREED\nGoblins are  malicious and mischievous. They play tricks and have a sense of humor that revels in another\u2019s discomfort. They are sly and untrustworthy. If you ever shake hands with one make sure you count your fingers afterwards.  They are also tough fighters, although only when cornered. They are not renowned for their bravery. If they are challenged by humans or creatures bigger than themselves they will turn and run if they can.  In addition to fighting with small axes and daggers they are also capable of biting and scratching.\nGoblins live in many different environments. There are colonies of them in woodlands living in underground networks borrowed out under tree roots. In the mountain regions they live in caverns and cave systems, In more recent years they have even established colonies in some of the larger towns where they have built homes in ruined buildings and sewer systems.\n\nHEART OF A DRAGONBORN\nA Heart of a Dragonborn is an extreme rarity. It is an elemental force with the blood and soul of a dragon inside a human body. They are warriors of the highest order, indeed many Knights and Crusaders believe such a half-human to be the highest pinnacle of pure fighting ability and spirit.\nThey wear unique armor that is said to be made of dragon hide that is impenetrable to blades, arrows and absorbs blows from weapons such as axes and maces. Beneath their armor their skin is dark, thick and slightly patterned appearing as if they are covered in scales. Their eyes are narrow, pupils vertical slits and like dragons, they do not blink.  Their faces are long and their nostrils slightly flared echoing their dragon origins.\nAs dragon blood runs through their bodies such a half-person is incorruptible. They are not attracted or influenced by money or gold. They serve no Lord or King and fight for no other purpose than their own. They do not explain their actions, indeed they do not speak to anyone. Their silence is forbidding and they are unapproachable.\n\nMAIDEN'S MELODY\nA Maiden can be of any class. They can be empowered with magical powers similar to that of a witch or sorceress. They can be battle hardened Warrior Maidens being proficient with a variety of deadly weapons. They can be Ice Maidens, woman who hail from the Far Northern Regions who have a certain power over snow and ice. They can be Water Maidens who can call on the inherent powers of rivers and lakes. Equally there is a flame haired clan known as the Fire Maidens who control the element of fire. Even more secretive is a particular class known as Death Maidens, woman who specialize in undertaking highly secret assassinations.\nAll maidens are solitary, self-sufficient wanderers and nomads roaming throughout the lands. They never settle only staying in one place long enough to fulfill a commission or complete a mission. They are insular and never take a partner. Many of them act as mercenaries but they demand such a high price that very few Lords and armies can afford to hire them for general battlefield warfare.  However some have been known to accept temporary employment as rangers or scouts, others as spies.\n\nMONK'S MEDITATION\nA Monk begins and lives the early years of life in a monastery where they receive training in both the mental and physical aspects of their chosen following. Through hours of meditation and lessons in spirituality they seek perfection of their eternal souls. Through equal hours of the study of martial arts they seek the perfection of the ultimate warrior.\nOutside the monastery a Monk may seem inoffensive, bordering on the meek and humble. However you can be assured that beneath their robes a monks body is a finely tuned fighting machine. Their fists are like iron, if they can punch their way through piles of roof tiles think what they can do to a human head. They are agile and can kick an opponent in the back of the head from a standing position in front of them. They are also expert in the use of the type of weapon most people have never seen before let alone fight against, such as the rice flail and deadly sharpened metal stars. They are also expert with spear, sword and dagger.\nPALADIN'S PERSEVERANCE\nThe Paladin is a Holy Warrior combining the beliefs and actions of both a Cleric and a Warrior. They model their beliefs and mode of dress after the typical knight in full armor that fought in the European wars and Crusades of the Middle Ages, carrying the Holy Cross in one hand and the bloodied sword in the other. They are fiercely loyal both to their religion and their Lord. They are heavily armored with ornate helmets with a surplus worn over the top that carries the symbol of their religion or the Lord that they follow. The same symbol is usually embellished on their shield. \nA Paladin without a symbol emblazoned on their tunic is a sword for hire, but be aware, their fees are extortionately high. They are expert with heavy arms such as battle axes, both single and double handed swords, long and short daggers and a lance for mounted combat. Some have also been known to carry the deadly ball and chain or a mace. However, make no mistake, whatever the weapon the Paladin chooses to carry, they are experts in their use.\n\nRANGER'S RAID\nA Ranger\u2019s skills are a wondrous but lethal combination of archer, hunter, scout and tracker. They are quiet and unassuming people and whilst not having an aggressive or warring nature, if a Ranger finds themselves in a fight they will usually win it. They are equally skilled with blade and bow. You are very foolish if you chose to make an enemy of such a person. They are at one with nature and by observing a falling leaf or hearing distant birdsong, they can tell who or what is abroad in the forest. By glancing at the sky they can predict the weather three days hence. For the right fee they can track an animal or a fugitive across a continent. \nBy nature they cast a lonely figure, more at home in deep forests and isolated countryside than in towns and villages. They own no loyalty to any faction, king, or leader. They worship no deity, their only God being the changing of the seasons. They are self sufficient and experts at foraging off the land. They are also experts in camouflage and wear clothing that echo the color of the forests or surrounding landscape. If you see a ranger it is because they wanted you to see them. Whenever a localized war breaks out, it is a Ranger that investigates the enemy lines and positions.\n\nROGUE'S REVENGE\nA Rogue can be of any race, creed, or gender. They do not wear a uniform or a particular item of clothing. They are only discernible by their actions. A Rogue relies upon their own skill and stealth to earn an unlawful living. They are very convincing con artists and use their enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities to gain the upper hand. Never take part in a game of chance with a Rogue if you wish to keep your shirt.\nThey are very adept in discovering and using their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They are quick thinkers and can usually find the solution to any problem. They also have the ability to talk their way out of trouble, although are well capable of defending themselves if pushed. They are expert in using weapons of stealth, both crossbows and long bows and specialists in both long and short dagger usage.\nSORCERER'S SPELL\nUsually Sorcerers are to be found in the employ of evil minded Kings, Emperors or people in positions of great power to assist with their aims and ambitions, although sometimes Sorcerer\u2019s can work alone on some great ideological scheme of their own device.\nSorcerers are solitary people preferring to create their magic from their own magical workshops, which are usually found in towers. Sorcerers like towers. They give them an air of superiority and allows them to look down on the rest of the world. It gives them great pleasure to have the world at their feet. It\u2019s also a secure location as they tend to surround the tower with protective spells. Woe betides any man or creature that tries to sneak up on a sorcerer in their tower. Many an uninvited guest has found themselves floating on a lily pad catching flies with their tongue, or wandering in a strange town in a strange land wondering how they got there and who are they anyway.\nTHE FEARLESS FIGHTER\nAs their name implies The Fearless Fighter knows no fear, they are frightened of nothing. A Fearless Fighter can be of any race or breed and of any gender. These fighters are the ones to be found at the head of the battle, urging their fellow troops and fighters onward and upward. They are the ones that put the heart, bloodlust and fighting spirit into their fellow fighters. They are the ones who will carry the standard high. \nWhilst they may not be the most proficient fighters with whatever weapon they chose to carry, on the battlefield they are natural born leaders. They are capable of making the most inspiring and dramatic speeches that blind their fellow fighters to their own fears and the reality of battle, enabling them all to commit great feats of bravery, courage and endeavor. A Fearless Fighter is not a scribe, but when in full flow their words inspire their fellow warriors as if they are hewn out of letters of fire.\nThe Fearless Fighter is also immune to any fear created or cast by spells or any fear inducing magic, no matter how high ranking the sorcerer or magician that cast them may be.  No one knows why, but a Fearless Fighter is simply immune to all Fear Spells That mere fact makes them even more valuable to any General or the leader of any army.\n\nVALKYRIE'S VENGEANCE \nLike a carrion crow that feeds off the death of warriors, a Valkyrie\u2019s place is the battlefield for it falls on the Valkyries to choose those warriors who will die in the battle to come. They chose who will live and who will join their Lords in the drinking and feasting halls of the dead. How they make their choice is not known, but their appearance over the battlefield excites and encourages the warriors below and serves to drive them on to a greater bloodlust.\nValkyries are always female, but as no one has ever seen a young Valkyrie, or an old Valkyrie, it is assumed they are actually immortals. They appear in the sky and have the gift of the power of flight from a pair of feathery, tapered wings that appear across their shoulders and down their backs. When they fly, they let out great screams and screeches, but no one is sure whether they are communicating with each other or whether the sounds are just expressions of pleasure.  It is neither lucky nor unlucky to see a Valkyrie, the only portent their appearance predicts that somewhere very soon there will be a battle and people will be killed.\n\nWANDERING WIZARD\nAs their name implies these wizards wander from realm to realm, from country to country looking for a home, a new Lord. As they have no one to answer to they are extremely dangerous. Their magic is wild and untamed and they use it not just for protection in the landscapes of the wild but they use it for hunting and to create their own comforts.\nWandering Wizards are capable of shift shaping and will seek out wolf packs and run the wild hunt with them. Indeed many Wandering Wizards have a wolf as their constant companion. Sometimes they have been known to raise demons and creatures of evil and set them free to roam and create havoc just to amuse themselves. Wandering Wizards do not carry weapons. They have no need of steel for protection. On no account should a warrior or knight of fortune ever attack such a Wizard. Magic is not only mightier than the sword, but it can be cast from a distance.\n\nWARLOCK'S WATCH\nWarlocks practice both white and black magic and like witches are capable of creating and casting spells for good and for harm and like witches use many natural ingredients as the basis of cures and potions. Like a witch they have enough control of magic to make one\u2019s life very uncomfortable if they so chose. Their skills with spells and potions are very effective. They can cure warts, or bring on a painful death.\nWarlocks that practice black magic are very dangerous. Like sorcerers and wizards they are capable of conjuring up demons and lesser demons only as their power is less, these apparitions can prove unstable and the last thing anyone wants to be confronted by is an unstable demon.\n\nWITCH'S WRATH\nThe real Witch conducts magic of the highest order. The evil malevolent witch studies and practices black magic which specializes in demonology and the worship of Satan whilst the white witch practices white magic which is sympathetic to nature and is a power for healing and good. Their magic is formed by learning and practicing spells, or incantations that create and draw the magic to them. These spells are notated in spell books that are handed down from generation to generation.\nMany witches are capable of shape shifting and all have a creature that they call their familiar. This familiar is a low-ranking demon that has the ability to take on the shape of an animal, such as a toad, dog, or black cat.  It is never wise to cross or upset a witch, as they are very powerful and have the ability to make life very uncomfortable for any who threatens them.\n\nFelt bag included with all D20 Reward Tiers.\nAll D6, 7pcs Main, and 12pcs Sets come with a collectible, felt-lined case.\n\nUNLOCKABLES\nOn top of the 21 styles included as options in the Heavy Metal Collection: Volume 1, we will be unlocking a new style at each of the funding levels listed below.

This Kickstarter we\u2019re introducing Keychain Spellbooks, leather bound hand-finished boxes crafted to store miniature gemstone dice (made from real gemstones!). In the past Elderwood has brought you Spellbooks and Spellbook Minis, so if you think we took our last idea and just smushed it, you\u2019re probably (and also exactly) correct.\n\nLike their predecessors and their predecessor\u2019s predecessor, Keychain Spellbooks are lovingly crafted from a variety of stunning natural wood options, wreathed in lush foil-stamped leather, and embellished with your choice of signature art. Except even smaller. Available in two types of interior and teeming with tenacity (and teensy gemstone dice), these tiny two-inch tomes are tailor-made to tend to your teeny treasures. \nKeychain Spellbooks are guaranteed (not really-- in life there are no guarantees) to make your keys harder to lose.\nThis campaign we\u2019re partnering up with Norse Foundry to bring you Mini Gemstone Dice exclusively available to bedazzle the interior of your Keychain Spellbook. Mini Gemstone Dice are just like regular Gemstone Dice, except it\u2019s easier to fit a whole set in your mouth. Read on to learn how to customize your Keychain Spellbook and add on Mini Gemstone Dice to your pledge.\nThey took all the raves that didn't happen in 2020 and put them into K9 Crystal Gemstone Dice.\nWood\nBegin your itty-bitty journey by selecting which of our hand-sanded, oil brushed woods speaks to you in the loudest, tiniest voice.  Classic woods are available for all Classic Keychain Spellbooks. Check out our Pledge Guide to calculate your additional pledge amount for Premium and Elite woods, and visit our build preview tool to see how your choices might look. \nWood so smooth you could... do something that requires a smooth wooden object.\n Leather & Foil\nPLAY\n\nKeychain Spellbooks are swathed in your choice of luxuriously durable leathers stamped in a gorgeous foil of your choosing. Our time-tested and supremely supple Granada leathers are available in seven of our classic colors, so you can drape your little friends in a drum-dyed cloak that most vividly expresses the spirit of their moon sign, or something.\nIn this Kickstarter, you'll be able to pick a different foil color for the border and the icon selection. Choose from these lustrous foil colors: gold, silver, bronze, maroon, forest, ocean sky, pink, rose gold, and pewter. Down below you'll see a handy reference image that displays what each of the available foils looks like pressed on the available leather choices. We are so thoughtful.\nNot pictured: Rose Gold, favorite among millennials.\nYou're getting veeeeery sleeeeeeepy. Unless you're not, in which case please ignore.\nArt\nDress up your Keychain Spellbook with a selection from our classic signature art options.\nInterior Configuration\nChoose between two different interior options for your Keychain Spellbook - Open and Spiral styles.  \n\nThe Spiral Interior holds 7-10 mini dice while the Open Interior can hold, like, a lot more.\nKeychain Eyelet Loop\nAww, look how happy this gargoyle is with his little Keychain Spellbook ^_^\nYou can put this bad boy on your keychain to ensure you're never without a set of tiny, shiny dice. We've force tested the leather eyelets and they're able to withstand up to 25lbs of force with the leather alone. We want to ensure the long life of the product and will be including antiqued metal reinforcement for the eyelet on all production versions.\n  If you just want to put this cutie in your pocket (or you have no keys and no keyrings), you can order without the eyelet, too.\n  Something something obscure Minecraft joke about Dice Plains Spikes etc.\nFeed your pint-sized puck some delicious little dice. We've got a veritable sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of tiny math rocks to offer, from gemstone to metal to resin. Check out the menu below, and then reference the pledge guide to see how to upgrade.\nMini Gemstone Dice (add $60 to any pledge)\nExactly like regular Gemstone Phoenix Dice, but cuter and infused with more positive karma. These sets include D20, D12, D10(dec), D10, D8, D6 and D4.\nPick your engraved font - Phoenix vs Norse styles\nAll Mini Gemstone dice are expertly cut and polished from their source stones. Phoenix and Norse editions of Mini Gemstone dice give you the chance to select from two different engraved numeral styles. Phoenix edition is an elegant flowing font with a phoenix engraved on the d6, and the Norse edition features a Dwarven stone-cut runic font.\nHey, does just one of you want to come to electrical with me?\nFinal versions of the Mini Rose Quartz Phoenix Edition will feature gold numerals\nMini Metal Phoenix Dice (add $20 to any pledge)\nLike death metal is to music, these dice are to other dice.

This line of highly detailed resin cast models is suitable for miniatures that are in 28-32 mm range. Although Altburg buildings are bigger in scale, they still fit very well with our second, 28mm range - Midgard. The Graveyard model fits very nicely with both of our ranges. Altburg has been created with interactivity and modularity in mind, taking the gaming experience to a new level. We wanted to create an ultimate Graveyard kit that allows Wargamers and RPG players to create their own Graveyard of any shape or size! Our Graveyard is realistic, highly detailed, and versatile - a true standout in the market. Together, let's get this produced and onto your gaming tables and diorama displays!\n\nEnter the Graveyard! \nGraveyard images shown above consist of parts that are included in the Priest pledge level (note that the base is not included, some additional parts are included)\n\nWhile created in a larger 32mm scale, the Graveyard fits 28, or even 25mm models beautifully and gives plenty of room to move models around the different features of the Graveyard.  \nThe Crow pledge contains everything a village or a small town Graveyard should have.\nIt consists of the following:\nChapel\nMausoleum\nTombstones\nTomb\nGargoyles (kickstarter exclusive gift - if unlocked)\nAccess to purchase all add-ons.\n\nRegular price for this set (after kickstarter) will be $145, but for our backers it is discounted to $131.\nIncluding discount and gifts (if unlocked) you save $24.  \nTo see more info on each of these elements, check out the Add-Ons section.\nIn order to process this project we will be shipping in groups with slightly different fulfillment times - which will be listed for each backer level.\n\nThe Gravedigger pledge contains all essential features a Graveyard should have. On top of that, to fight off grave robbers, it contains 57 in. (145 cm) of surrounding walls and fences, and a set of Dead Trees for added atmosphere.  \nIt consists of the following:\nChapel\nMausoleum\nTombstones\nTomb\nDead Trees\nUndertaker Hut (kickstarter exclusive!)\n 3\u00d7 Straight Walls\nCurved Walls\n 2\u00d7 Straight Pillars\nCorner Pillars\nMiscellaneous Pillars\nGargoyles (kickstarter exclusive gift - if unlocked)\nSmall Graveyard Gates (gift - if unlocked)\nAccess to purchase all add-ons.\n\nRegular price for this set (after kickstarter) will be $367, but for our backers it is discounted to $330.\nIncluding discount and gifts (if unlocked) you save $64.\nTo see more info on each of these elements, check out the Add-Ons section.\nIn order to process this project we will be shipping in groups with slightly different fulfillment times - which will be listed for each backer level.\n\nThe Priest pledge contains all that a big city Graveyard should have. Many tombstones and other common Graveyard features are complemented by Walls and Fences that allow you to enclose your Graveyard through your own, intricate design, topped with magnificent Graveyard Gates. The total length of walls in this set is 88 in. (223 cm). To round it off, this pledge also includes two sets of Dead Trees to make your crows feel right at home. \nIt consists of the following:\nChapel\nMausoleum\n 2\u00d7 Tombstones\nTomb\n 2\u00d7 Dead Trees\nUndertaker Hut (kickstarter exclusive!)\nGraveyard Gates\n 3\u00d7 Straight Walls\n 3\u00d7 Curved Walls\n 3\u00d7 Straight Pillars\nCorner Pillars\n 2\u00d7 Miscellaneous Pillars\nGargoyles (kickstarter exclusive gift - if unlocked)\nSmall Graveyard Gates (gift - if unlocked)\nRuined Walls (gift - if unlocked)\nShrine (gift - if unlocked)\nAccess to purchase all add-ons.\n\nRegular price for this set (after kickstarter) will be $540, but for our backers it is discounted to $486.\nIncluding discount and gifts (if unlocked) you save a massive $131.\nTo see more info on each of these elements, check out the Add-Ons section.\nIn order to process this project we will be shipping in groups with slightly different fulfillment times - which will be listed for each backer level.\nAfter you have chosen a Pledge level (reward), you can choose to add any add-on to your pledge. Each Add-on has the price tag next to it. You simply click on Manage your pledge and increase the amount pledged for the value of the chosen add-on. You can choose any number of each add-on, you just need to increase the full amount pledged for the total value of all add-ons chosen. \n\nFor example, you can choose the Crow pledge level, and want to add one additional set of Tombstones and a set of Dead Trees add-on. You select the Crow pledge and then use Manage your pledge to increase the total amount pledged for the amounts of $36 for the additional Tomstones and $46 for the Set of Dead Trees. So your total pledge would be $131 + $36 + $46 = $213. You can manage your pledge any number of times during the campaign. After the campaign, you will be asked which add-ons you have chosen in our Pledge Manager.\n\nOne of the great features of the new Graveyard kit is modularity without sacrificing quality or detail. We designed a system of walls and fences that allows you to make the Graveyard to your own liking. Once you've enclosed your burial ground, it is time to fill it with some tombstones, tombs, mausoleums or even some trees, the chapel or an undertaker hut. Feel free to add any number of these to your pledge. In addition, these add-ons can be used in various ways, not necessarily as a part of the Graveyard. For example, the Chapel can be a stand-alone piece and can fit in various settings, the Undertaker Hut can be used as a shed of any kind, and the possibilities of the fences are andless.\n\nThe Chapel is a great addition to any gaming table, and it fits in many different settings and time periods. Apart from using it with Graveyard, it can be used as a small roadside chapel for example, or maybe even a private family chapel in your town.\nDimensions: 9 x 4 x 4 in. (23 x 10 x 10 cm)\nChapel add-on consists of 7 parts and is valued at $58\nMausoleums are monumental features and make any Graveyard, look remarkable. They are large and impressive constructions most often built for a deceased leader or nobility.\nDimensions: 6 x 3\u00bd x 4 in. (15 x 9 x 10 cm)\n Mausoleum add-on consists of 1 part and is valued at $34.\nThe Tombstones present the core of any graveyard. Throughout history, graves have been a focus for mourning and remembrance. The names of relatives are often added to a tombstone over the years, so that one tombstone may chronicle the passing of an entire family spread over decades. Since tombstones and a plot in a graveyard cost money, they are also a symbol of wealth or prominence in a community. Some gravestones were even commissioned and erected to their own memory by people who were still living, as a testament to their wealth and status. In this set you will find the tombstones of various sizes, as well as some vases and crows!\nTombstones add-on consists of 33 parts and is valued at $36.\nTombs are small buildings that serve as a repository for the remains of the dead. To get even more variety in your Graveyard pick a tomb or two. :)\nDimensions: 4 x 2\u00bd x 3 in. (10 x 6 x 8 cm)\nTomb add-on consists of 1 part and is valued at $18.\nDead Trees will give your Graveyard that creepy, dark atmosphere and make it more intriguing. Dead Trees can be used in all settings.\nDimensions: \nTree one: 8\u00bd x 5 x 4 in. (22 x 13 x 10 cm)\nTree two: 7 x 7 x 4 in. (18 x 18 x 10 cm)\nDead Trees add-on consists of 11 parts and is valued at $46.\nThis Kickstarter exclusive add-on will make your Graveyard standout. The Undertaker Hut comes with lots of cool details like a coffin, shovel, pickaxe, hoe, saw and a workbench. The hut can be also used in different roles and various settings.\nDimensions: 3 x 4 x 3 in. (8 x 10 x 8 cm)\nUndertaker Hut add-on consists of 8 parts and is valued at $42.\nThis massive, decorative Graveyard gate, with iron doors and inscription in stone will make your graveyard a true centerpiece! The gates are a part of the Fences system, but can be used as a standalone structure as well. The doors are hinged and fully functional.\nDimensions: 5 x 7 x \u00be in. (13 x 18 x 2 cm)\n Graveyard gate add-on consists of 4 parts and is valued at $24.\nWe designed a system of walls and fences that gives you endless possibilities! There are five types of pillars with different indentations and two types of walls with corresponding projections that allow you to assemble walls and fences in any shape you like! This system may be used in various ways, not only for graveyards. They are perfect for urban and rural settings.\nStraight Walls add-on consists of 5 parts and is valued at $22.\nDimensions of one section: 2\u00bd x 1\u00bd x \u00bd in. (6 x 4 x 1 cm)\nCurved Walls add-on consists of 5 parts and is valued at $22.\nDimensions of one section: 1\u00be x 1\u00bd x \u00bd in.

We will constantly work on new add-ons and present them to you during the campaign.\nUnlocked at $45,000\nWhat is a Graveyard without some menacing Gargoyles. Spice up your Graveyard and give it that Gothic feel with a Kickstarter exclusive set of these fantastical animals.\nGargoyles add-on consists of 4 parts and is valued at $10.\nUnlocked at $50,000\nIf you are making a smaller Graveyard and need an entrance that is not so grandiose, Small Gates are a perfect solution! Also, if your Graveyard is big in size, Small Gates are ideal for adding the secondary entrance in the back or the sides. The doors are hinged and fully functional. \nSmall Gates add-on consists of 4 parts and is valued at $17.\nUnlocked at $55,000\nRuined walls are perfect to make additional access points to your graveyard, or any other feature that is enclosed in walls and fences. They will also make your setting visually more interesting. You can combine them in various ways and use them as a part of Walls & Fences system. The possibilities are endless!\nRuined Walls add-on consists of 5 parts and is valued at $28.\nUnlocked at $60,000\nA Wayside Shrine is a religious image, usually in some sort of small shelter, placed by a road or pathway, sometimes in a settlement or at a crossroads, but often in the middle of an empty stretch of country road, or at the top of a hill or mountain. The Wayside Shrine is designed as a part of the Walls & Fences system. However, you can use it as standalone feature as well.\nWayside Shrine add-on consists of 3 parts and is valued at $22.\nUnlocked at $90,000\nThe Church can be featured in the Graveyard, but also as a part of a nearby village or a town. While the smaller Chapel is perfect to serve as a Chantry where the prayers for the dead are made, the Church, bigger in size, can accommodate more townsfolk for their daily worship.\nDimensions: 12 x 7 x 4 in. (30 x 18 x 10 cm)\nChurch add-on consists of 9 parts and is valued at $89\nUnlocked at $95,000\nChurch/Chapel Accessories add-on. A nice 7 part set to fill up your Chappel or Church. Note that this set is free to all who add the Church to their pledge. If you want this set, and don't want the Church, or you need more than one set, you can add it to your pledge at $14 a piece.\nChurch Accessories add-on consists of 7 parts and is valued at $14\nUnlocked at $100,000\nCorpse Cart add-on. Many Londoners from the 1665 and the Black Plague period would remember a lot of these roaming around the city. Bring out the dead, the undertaker would yell, while carrying the corpses to the outskirts of the town to be buried with no name.\nFor the 100,000 goal, we decided to treat you with a freebie. Note that Corpse Cart is a free gift  for all pledges above $100. For smaller pledges and those who want more than one Corpse Cart, you can always take more for $14 a piece.\nCorpse Cart add-on consists of 3 parts and is valued at $14\nThis grandiose and towering structure is a perfect centerpiece that will make your Graveyard truly spectacular! \nKing\u2019s Mausoleum will be priced at $92.

The discount will range from $0.5 (for Crow backers), up to a massive $3 (for heavy backers with $800 pledged or more) for every $1000 pledged above $100,000. So, for example, if we get to $130,000, heavy backers with $800+ pledged will get the King\u2019s Mausoleum for free!!!\nNote that the discount will be calculated when the Graveyard Kickstarter campaign ends. Each backer will be able to add the King\u2019s Mausoleum to his reward in the pledge manager after the campaign, at the according price.\nBe sure to spread the word about this deal, as it is up to you how much will the King\u2019s Mausoleum cost in the end!\nUnlocked at $115,000\nMake life easier for your Undertaker! This little beast helps him to pull the cart around and makes for a good company. :)\nDonkey add-on consists of 1 part and is valued at $10\nNote that this photo is for display purpose only.

Would you like a free game?  Scroll down to see our REFERRAL BONUS CONTEST.\nWe developed our game to entertain family and other visitors to our home.  What started as a card game grew into the board game we all love today.  We meant to introduce this game to like-minded tabletop fans at the last two Gary Cons but the pandemic halted the notion.  Recently, we decided to launch our game on Kickstarter.  We're a little company consisting of family and friends, but our ideas are big. Become a backer to help us get bigger and better with every project.  Thanks!\n\nThe primary reasons we are passionate about bringing this game to as many players as possible are:\n1.  We hope to pay our artist, Kristen Puckett of Ballyraven Studios, enough to secure her work and vision for other upcoming games, storybooks and adventure modules.  \n2.  We have over a dozen other projects waiting to be completed, tabletop games, storybooks, RPG adventure modules, and three Dial the Dice follow-up editions.  We hope this Kickstarter is our first step in a long journey.  \n3.   We have made many close and loving friends, from all over the world, at game conventions.  The sense of community and comradery we've felt from these wonderful people over the years is unmatched.  We hope our game will bring some of that feeling to your tabletop as well.  \n\n*NOTE: Though the estimated shipping date is for October, we believe we will be able to beat this deadline significantly.  Scroll down for more details.\n NOTE: Backers who are camera shy may consider their favorite pet's head for the Early Bird Reward instead of their own.  \nShown here is the concept example. The final \"floating head\" box top will be more refined to blend in with the box. Enhanced colors, possible gray as shown in the YOU BEASTIE! Reward. Specific style of the floating head will be determined by the quality of pictures provided by backers.\n\nBox contents are described below in both text and video.\n\nThis is a concept image. Text placement and font may vary.\n Some pawns do not have sufficient overhead space for text. Below is a list of the pawns suitable for your special name.  \"Give me a name, Bastian!\"\n3 Webbers, 2 Goblins, Ghosts, and Chiweenie-bats, 1 Bear, Boar, and Deer.  Named Beasties will have a unique special ability chosen just for them listed in the rulebook.\nExamples: Lost Caverns of the Dread Myra Scott, George's Hardy Apple Grove, Cassie Joe's Swamp of Slump.\n Prime Real Estate is limited so get yours before another nasty beastie inhabits the lair. We will keep track of available options on our DtD Facebook page.  We will work with you on the name of your real estate concerning flow and text space on the game board.\nUnlike the prototype above, your final Beastie will have a forest background on the pawn.\n YOU BEASTIE is a first come first serve reward.  Backers may choose to morph with the following Beasties: 3 zombies, 3 goblins, 2 dwarfs, 2 trolls, or 2 cuddly mole people. Due to space on the pawn, your beastie name will be in the rulebook next to your personalized special ability (chosen just for you by one of our fair and balanced DtD rules creators). Everyone loves a surprise!\nExtra and enhanced artwork will be provided by Ballyraven Studio, examples are shown below.\n\n\nWe can make this happen very quickly as we have already tested out multiple prototypes and revised artwork.  What you see in our promo videos is pretty close, if not exactly, to what most of the game pieces will look like.  Our beloved artist, from Ballyraven Studios, has agreed to enhance and add even more artwork if certain stretch goals are unlocked.  My quotes from manufacturers are approved and ready for mass production.  Only additions and upgrades from the STRETCH GOALS will add any more time to the process.  The video below shows what you can expect in the core game box when it arrives.  NOTE: The rulebook is spotlighted in another video.\nUse the unique Dice Dials (left) to move your Hero across the board OR use your favorite set of polyhedral dice (right)!\nCheck out our DtD Facebook page for details on alternative ways to play!\n Them: \"A modular board game? No way!\"          \n Us: \"Way.\"\nSome components may change due to stretch goal success and other beneficial additions such as art and design enhancements.\nGoblin and Saint Heroes Included in Every Box.\nWizard and Warrior Heroes Included in Every Box.\nUnlock the Trios of Heroes: Shrouds of Shadow and The Mighty Mythlanders.\n Shrouds of Shadow: Hunter, Thief, Bard           Mighty Mythlanders: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome\n\nEnjoy some videos below which spotlight certain aspects and components of \nDial the Dice: Fantasy Edition.\n How do we keep track of referrals? The old fashioned way. If you become a backer by referral, simply send us a PM of the name of your referral. Once a referral source is claimed by 3 backers, the name is added to our super-cool random drawing list!\nShipping information has been updated and is now included in the pledge process.\nTerms and Conditions:  By backing this Kickstarter, you are acknowledging and agreeing to the details of this page and that the final reward may have some slight changes such as, but not limited to, artwork enhancements, additions, or possible reformatting.  Note that any and all changes would be done with the benefit of the backers in mind.  Some of the process such as manufacturing and shipping, may be out of our control but we will endeavor and end up with the best possible outcome for our backers.  When the campaign ends we are responsible to ship the rewards to you after payments are secured.\n\nSome rewards require collaboration between game design team and backers. In such instances, backers are responsible to supply pictures, name spellings, and an email stating that their submitted name and/or image submissions are given freely and with permission from the name and/or image holder. Names and images which are suspect of social irresponsibility or in poor taste may be declined (in which case, alternate names and/or images may be submitted). As long as submissions are family friendly there should be no need for decline. P House Games and representatives are not responsible should a backer fail to submit required data for such rewards.  Images, spellings, and email should be submitted no later than 30 days from the last day of the campaign.  \n\nHOW TO PLAY: For a core rules game, players maneuver their hero pawns across the game board by dialing dice to specific numbers and number combinations. This allows players to call upon certain moves, abilities, skills, etc. for their hero. Event and item cards drive the hero's 12 tasks which must be accomplished to win the game.  The first player to complete 12 tasks wins.\nThere are multiple ways to play this very modular board game (refer to our Dice Dialers FB page for more details) including single player and co-op.  Official core game play rules are below and are referenced in videos above. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done business with our manufacturers and our artists are friends and family members. Even though this is our first Kickstarter, we have personal friends who are independent game designers and have been in the business for decades. For these reasons we believe the only foreseeable risks and challenges are:\n\n 1. Any unforeseen delays from manufacturers or shipping companies.\n 2. Upper tier stretch goals will likely require a bit more time from our artist.\n 3. Social Media Presence is minimal so we will rely heavily on our backers to help us \n get the word out. The upside is that this helps keep the costs down for backers.\n\nWe already have several copies of the complete game. We will fine tune aesthetics as the Kickstarter progresses and should be ready to begin manufacturing very soon after the campaign ends (once custom data is collected from backers). Our Chief Artist, from Ballyraven Studios, will take necessary time needed to complete any additional art required by stretch goals before full production begins.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe only thing in a Dial the Dice: Fantasy Edition box that isn't made of paper is the plastic bases for the pawns.

In 2019 we visited the Desert of the Dead and manufactured its multiple armies. Now in 2021 we are expanding upon our range of fantasy miniatures once again. We have had two hugely successful Kickstarter campaigns with the most recent being well over 2000% funded after including late pledges. Now with your help we want to produce a whole load of new armies, characters and monsters. The original plan was for one big Kickstarter with a whole host of armies but in order to make each more digestible and to aid with delivery times we have adjusted to smaller campaigns.\nOur halfling campaign featured a pair of monsters designed by RJ Palmer and we got him back onboard for this one too! He drew up a total of 6 dragons for us to turn into miniatures.\nAs ever our Terrain Wizards at TTCombat have come up with some fantastic new designs to compliment the armies in this campaign!\nA 3D Render of the Halfling Mega Fortress and its interior buildings\n All of these models are 28mm scale resin figures produced in house at TTCombat HQ in the South West of England. If the project is successfully funded we are aiming to deliver the pledges in November 2021. While a huge amount of the work is already done we have learned from previous Kickstarter campaigns that it is better to overestimate the delivery date and be early than to have delays! Weekly updates to keep our backers informed have been key in our past campaigns and something we really enjoy doing after the project completes.\nA completed version of the gatehouse section\nThe majority of models come supplied with square bases to form regiments. Some items are on different bases which are noted on the add on image. Round bases are available as a bargain add on should you wish to use them differently.\nThe models are full of character and a delight to paint.\nMany of the miniatures in this Campaign are one piece however some of the more dynamic models are multi part and will require assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTCOMBAT & TrollTrader employ a number of passionate gamers. We take great pride in our work and great pleasure in our gaming! We are based in Cornwall at the very bottom of the UK.\nWe handle all of our own shipping. We send thousands of orders each week so this kickstarter is in good hands.\nUK: \u00a32\nEU: \u00a34\nRest of the world: \u00a36\nThat's it! Put as many Add-ons as you like, because flat rate shipping is in!\nThere aren't any real risks! We already have almost all of the 3D files and multiple people who can produce more. We have pretty much everything else we need to complete this project in house. Previously we have had a huge number of stretch goals on our campaigns adding more and more as the projects goes on. While these are great they add a lot of extra work which have often delayed our shipping. For this campaign we have a set number and if we take them all out then thats it folks!

We are proud to be the original designers of this tray format, and though there are many knock-offs, nothing is quite like the original.  With this project, we are proud to announce our brand new Color Shift Dice Trays with some awesome new features.  With your support, we will be able to reach our launch goal, where 4 new base designs and 4 new color shift lid designs become available to our backers.  Additional stretch goals will also be added as this campaign progresses, along with some great add-on items.\n1.  New Base Designs - printed designs offer a new look to these trays.  Backers will be able to choose from 4 new designs for the base of the tray.  A non-printed grey base will also be available.\n2.  New Color Shift Transitional Foil - our new transitional foil changes with the light, offering really cool blue and purple tones to the lid designs.\n3.  New Emblem Designs - we are making several new emblems available, that have not previously been produced on our dice trays.  These emblem designs match our other dice bags and cases so you can add to your collections.\n4.  Fully Customized Project - you get to choose your base designs, and you pick your lid emblems.  Mix and match designs as you choose with no limitations.\n\n\nStep 1 - Choose Your Base Design\nBase Design 'A'\nBase Design - 'A'\nBase Design 'B'\nBase Design - 'B'\nBase Design 'C'\nBase Design - 'C'\nBase Design 'D' \nBase Design - 'D'\nSolid Grey Color - No Design Printing\nStep 2 - Choose Your Lid Design\nOuroboros Design\nPhoenix Design\nSword Design\nDragon's Breath Design\nRaven Design\nWolf Design\nDagger Design\nCleric Design\nSpell Book Design\nCeltic Knot Dragon Design\nCthulhu Design\nLion Design\nCOLOR SHIFT FOIL - COLOR VARIATIONS\nOur Color Shift foil is designed to reflect a variation of blue and purple colors as the light in the room hits changes.  By design, this foil can have more blue or more purple in it, depending on where the material is located on the roll.  Because of that, some minor color variations can exist from one tray to another.  Below is an example of this color variation.  As you can see, the color of the stamped foil changes from light blues to dark purples, but one is darker with more purple, and the other is lighter with more blue tones.  \nPLAY\n\nDice Tray Details\nThis style of dice tray was designed by Easy Roller Dice Company a couple of years ago.  As fans of this design already know, the base of the dice tray is divided into two areas - the raised dice staging area, and the center rolling area.\nThe dice staging area is perfect for keeping your dice out of the way of your rolling space.  This staging area can hold about 30 standard-sized polyhedral dice and helps to minimize your dice moving around in transport.\n\nThis tray design also features a tight-fitting lid that will keep the contents of the tray secure during transport and between gaming sessions.  With the lid on, you can throw this in a backpack, the trunk of your car, or put it right on the shelf knowing that your dice or miniatures inside will the secure.\nHere's a look at the dice staged around the rolling surface in the staging area.\nReward Details\nFor this project, backers will simply choose the number of dice trays they would like from the rewards column on the right.\nStretch Goals\n All of the dice & dice cup stretch goals will be able to be purchased as an add-on to your pledge when they become unlocked.  All of the trays listed below will become selectable once at the end of the campaign if they become unlocked when we reach the desired stretch goal dollar amount listed beside the items.\nThe Metal Dice of Ancient Dragons Silver 7 Piece Set With Purple Numbering is now unlocked!  You can now add one of these sets to your pledge by simply selecting your pledge tier and selecting this as an add-on.  This will add $25 to your pledge when you add it on! You can add as many sets to your pledge as you'd like.  If additional sets of dice in this campaign unlock you'll be able to select from any of them!\nMatching Color Shift Dice Cups\n This series of cups are now available to add to your pledge!  You can do that under any tier.  The system will ask you if you'd like a cup to add-on.

As promised, here are the two other great powers of Valerna, ancestral Nahuac and blessed Ysval, ready to enter the fray!\nValerna is a continent filled with magic, powerful nations, great heroes and dragons. These forces fight to exert their own ideals in a land with no gods, where only mortals, and how they use their power, can decide the world's fate.\nEach realm in Valerna espouses different moral values, wields different magic, and uses different weapons and tactics. The Winner of the War is not only the strongest force, but also the one that better knows how to turn their philosophy into power, and their character into weapons.\nThe greatest of these champions are the Dragonbonded - leaders of the mortal armies who have joined their lives with those dragons, and whose actions are destined to reshape history.\nYou can enjoy all of this magic in our original Wargame, where special effects, upgrading dice and bonding with dragons can give the upper hand. In it, players build armies and challenge each other, acting and reacting to the events that unfold on the battlefield.\nThe battlefield is represented by a gaming table where both armies are deployed. Each side has different units, and the armies are unique; the final objective is to beat your opponent. Players deploy their armies and strategies, however, luck plays an important role, as the dice will ultimately decide the success of an attack or action.\nEnter the world of Dragonbond, build an army like no other and use each unique part of your army to your advantage. Whether through decimation or the completion of special requirements, only one may be the victor.\n1: Players assemble an army with several units led by a Dragonbonded general, who can turn the tide of a battle.\n2: By using exchangeable cards, you can pair units with different captains. Dragons and generals are also coupled with archetypes of your choice.\n3: The dice system in the game allows you to upgrade your dice, giving some control over rolls and results, to match your strategy while retaining the thrill of chance.\n4: To achieve victory, you must complete particular objectives such as getting first blood, wiping out entire units, or reaching strategic locations, to score points at the end of each round.\n5: Players alternate activations for their units, after most actions, the units become fatigued. You must assess the risk and rewards of using your most powerful units in a single round; with too much fatigue, their dice rolls could be permanently downgraded.\n6: Your captains provide unique abilities to your units while they are alive. When your unit gets enough wounds, you must remove one of its models. If you choose to sacrifice the captain, a new special ability will be activated.\n7: Your General\u2019s abilities change the way your units and strategy feel and play. Dragons are powerful units that can wipe out entire enemy squads. Both of them can be customized with archetypes cards.\nExcept for the base one-dollar pledge, every pledge, regardless of its tier, includes not only the rules to our game, but a primer of our factions and the world of Valerna. Higher tiers involve from one to four STL packs of our armies. Terrains, additional game components, returning armies and RPG adventures  are not only available on higher tiers, they are also individually available as add-ons.\nThe base rewards for this campaign are the armies of Nahuac and Ysval, ready to join the ever-expanding world of Valerna; however, this is also a chance to build your own armies of Allaria and Tyveria if you were unable in our previous campaign.\nNahuac\nBuilt by the shape-shifting and humanoid animal peoples of Valerna, the Nahuinn coalition is a powerhouse made up of a vast array of cultures pulled together by their respect of the balance of nature. From the wise bendavee to the swift munkisoot and headstrong ocelinn, Nahuac and its people will prevail.\n\n\nYsval\nForged by the cold and a deep-rooted sense of collaboration and community, the Holy Ysvalian Alliance has made a fertile paradise of the unforgiving north of Valerna. Allied with the Hmyr giants and the good-life loving Pints, Ysvalians bring a strong, stern challenge to all on the battlefield.\nReturning favorites\nThe dream-shaping Allarian kingdom and the blood-centric Tyverian Empire return. This is one more chance to build your very own complete set of all armies of Valerna.\nDive into the fascinating world of Dragonbond. Explore the realms of Valerna as developed by veteran artists who have worked on projects at Wizards of the Coast, Blizzard and other such companies.

Keep in touch with us through our social media pages:\nBuilding a universe as vast and wild as Dragonbond is a constant push, pull and elbow bumping between writers, artists and the budding creativity that comes from working in games. We wanted to make a world that felt fresh in the saturated scheme of high fantasy, and we think we made it. Here are a few sketches and growth given to Erandi.\n\nWe created Nahuac and the Coatl brood to honor our legacy as Mexicans and explore the fun and thematic promise of a land shaped by cosmopolitan understanding and balance-focused collaboration. Erandi, our Ocelinn bonded, stands as a warrior leader who stands in high contrast to the endless political machinations of her neighbors. Tezcoatl, her bonded dragon, rises as an incredibly curious creature, forcing Erandi to understand or, at the very least, learn a bit.\nOur bearded, humble hammer, Oryan is a near undisputed favorite for Holy Duk of Ysval. His encounter with Rakzor, the stubborn and violent Exxor dragon will change his plans forever and force him to undergo a long inner journey of growth. A paragon of strength in the Alliance, Oryan will never falter at the face of danger, regardless of whether he fears it or not.\n\nWe wanted a balancing shape to the dark, looming presence of Tyveria and the Null. Despite  his own flaws and responsibility, Oryan\u2019s character had to be happy and boisterous to not only shed light into our world, but to challenge it.\nPlease enjoy this video of our beloved art director Tom Babbey, with concept artists Steve Prescott and Vinod Rams as they discuss the process of creating art as wonderful as theirs.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th campaign.

The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works? Check out the preview of The Darkest House now for a look at a few of the rooms and features. Download it for either macOS or Windows (below). Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map? Click them, and the description will open to the right.\nSome items aren't tagged on the map. Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Cypher System, super-complex boxed games such as Invisible Sun, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, dozens of hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them. We are extremely proud of our track record, and we're confident that this project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nThis campaign is funding digital rewards only.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "The Darkest House", "descp": "The house invites you in.\nThe house hates you.\nThe house relishes solitude.\nThe house is lonely.\nThe house is in pain.\nThe house wants your pain.\nThe house hates you.\nYou get a complete copy of The Darkest House, including any upgrades resulting from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Darkest House", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["719 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 85 or more", "title": "Exclusive: The Devoured Halls", "descp": "The House is not alone.\nYou get a complete copy of The Darkest House, including any upgrades resulting from stretch goals.

Here you will learn the secrets of the world's best miniature painters!\nWe have partnered up with 4 of the best painters in the industry. Each one will paint 12 different miniatures to their highest level of quality. Then you, the backers, will choose 24 miniatures for us to paint on camera (6 models from each painter). This gives you the opportunity to select only the very best work from each painter!\nNO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED! This series is perfect for beginners and professionals alike. Our goal is to help you quickly improve your skills by building upon each subsequent lesson. Each video will introduce new skills and techniques to help you quickly master the art of miniature painting. By end of the series - you will be a miniature painting GOD!\nAll 48 miniatures have been carefully selected to demonstrate a wide variety of learning techniques. We include male and female characters, humans and monsters, fantasy and sci-fi. \nThe following is a list of miniatures we've selected for each painter. (Disclaimer: This list may be subject to change. We do not claim ownership of any character or image used. Copyrights belong to their respective owners.)\nBelevor Ranger by RN Estudio (32mm)\nCrescendia - Greek Warrior by RN Estudio (54mm)\nWitch-Queen by ArtelW (45mm)\n Beast Slayer by ArtelW (83mm)**\nRuna - Dwarven Beauty by Artisan Guild (28mm)\nKuo-Toa Sage by Print'n Paint (45mm)\nHigh Lord by ArtelW (34mm)\nOrc Queen V1 by Yedharo Models (55mm)\nLantern Guard by Kingdom Death (28mm)\nDeath High Archivist by Kingdom Death (28mm)\nOgre Chieftan by Reaper (28mm)\nHalfdan, Giant slayer Dwarf by Print'n Paint (35mm)\n\nBronen The Barbarian by Joaquin Palacios (35mm)\nDrogor the Half Orc by Joaquin Palacios (35mm)\nNorse Blacksmith by Andrea Miniatures (54mm)\nLerta the Cursed by Signum Games (39mm)\nJarvis, Militia Sergeant by Signum Games (40mm)\nElite Ratman Commander by Punga Miniatures (28mm)\nHill Giant Lowland Warrior by Reaper Miniatures (40mm)\nKavorgh, Orc Warboss by Reaper Miniatures (30mm)\n Skawt`n`Rekkon Kammandah by ArtelW (38mm)**\nEinherjar`s Tank Commander by ArtelW (30mm)\nDeath High Lucy by Kingdom Death (28mm)\nHulk Minotaur Hero by Print'n Paint (28mm)\n Liath by Kimera Models (75mm)**\nMordwael, Dreaguth Warrior by Mierce Miniatures (28mm)\nSister Bloodshedda by ArtelW (35mm)\nWarlock of Crimson Legion by ArtelW (40mm)\nGreatblade Grey-Fur by Mierce Miniatures (55mm)\nOrc Marauder by First Legion (38mm)\nIorwerth, Teulu Warrior by Mierce Miniatures (28mm)\nMastermind Brute by ArtelW (33mm)\nBarthum the Mighty Dwarven Warrior by First Legion (28mm)\nBarbarian Dude - Definitive Edition (40mm)\nVampire Zombie by Titan Forge (28mm)\nJusticia,  Female monster hunter by RN Estudio (32mm)\nDisciple of Vidarr by Durgin Paint Forge (28mm)\nIron Crow Warrior by Durgin Paint Forge (28mm)\nAncient Barbarians by Print'n Paint (30mm)\n Leader of the Dread Squad by ArtelW (48mm)**\nGoblin King by Print'n Paint (40mm)\nMutant Ratmen by Print'n Paint (32mm)\nArtemisa Goddess by RN Estudio (32mm)\nTahnar by Titan-Forge (32mm)\nKobold by Manuel Boria (42mm)\nTroll by Manuel Boria (60mm)\nVampire Zombie by Titan Forge (28mm)\nThe Unspeakable by Print'n Paint (60mm)\n ** counts as two choices (due to size and number of small details).\nWe've partnered up with 4 of the MOST FAMOUS painters in the industry. Each one of them has won multiple awards for their work and each of them have over 15,000 followers across social media.\nIf you want to keep up to date with the painting progress follow them now! They will be posting their progress on their 12 miniatures here!\nRodrigo Cipres - follow him on INSTAGRAM\nRobert Karlsson - follow him on FACEBOOK\nArnau Lazaro - follow him on INSTAGRAM\nDavid Arroba - follow him on INSTAGRAM\nBelow are some examples of the INCREDIBLE WORK they have done over the years! And guess what... they are even better TODAY!!!\nOnce the Kickstarter is funded our painters will begin painting up their miniatures. Over the 60 days of the Kickstarter, each of them will paint 4-5 miniatures from their list of 12.\nAll 12 miniatures will be fully painted by the end of July 2021. Once all 48 miniatures are painted, backers will have 7 days to vote for their favorite 24 to see re-created on camera (6 miniatures from each painter).\nFilming with our first artist will begin in August 2021. Each Artist will film for 15-20 days. Once filming is done, the edited video bundle will be available within 3 weeks.\nThere are 4 video bundles - each video bundle will be released approximately 2 months apart. The first video bundle will be available in September 2021 (see schedule below).\nA two-month gap between video bundles gives us ample time to film and edit - and it gives you the backer time to watch each bundle.\nPROFESSIONALY FILMED in 8K\nTypical miniature painting videos (You-Tube/Patreon/Twitch) use consumer camcorders which highly compress the video files. Those files are compressed again when uploaded to platforms like YouTube, suffering a DOUBLE HIT to their quality.\nOur videos will be captured in super high quality 8K video using professional broadcast/film equipment. This allows us to retain 5 - 10 times more information per-frame than typical camcorders used on YouTube/Patreon/Twitch.\nDOWNLOADABLE FILES - That's right! Once the videos are edited you'll be given a link to download the files. That means NO DOUBLE HIT to the image quality - and no shipping delays!!!\nWhere are the 8K video samples you ask? \nUnfortunately, we don't have any - 8K is incredibly expensive to shoot in. So, it's an all or nothing deal. We can't justify purchasing the equipment simply to shoot a 20 second test video if the Kickstarter is unsuccessful.\nAside from a new camera, we need a ton of brand new equipment specially designed to handle the massive data from 8K. The high-speed hard drives alone will cost well over $10,000! (we have lots of footage to capture).\nWe have been making miniature painting videos with world's best artists for over 10 years - you are in good hands. We know this industry inside and out!\nYou can check out some cool videos shot in 8K on YouTube. This is the quality you can expect!\nHere is a sample of a painting video we have shot in past. It's 47 minutes long and will give you a good idea of our work. Click the image below to download the file - it's too big to post on Kickstarter (over 1.5 GB). If you see an \"ERROR', simply refresh/reload the page. Enjoy!\nTHIS IS NOT 8K - Our 8K videos will have 5 - 10 times better quality!\nAGAIN - THIS IS NOT 8K - Our 8K videos will have 5 - 10 times better quality!\nThe \"K\" in \"8K\" stands for \"thousand\". It refers to the number of horizonal pixels in one frame of video. 8K has approximately 8000 horizonal pixels! \nWhy shoot in 8K?\nBefore we explain why we are shooting in 8K, you need to understand how most people view their video content online. Most people own computer monitors with HD or less resolution (1920 x 1080 resolution). Only 2% of people own a 4K monitor - even less have an 8K monitor.\nLost yet? Don't worry - this concept can be a bit confusing to most people. You are probably wondering - \"If the majority of monitors can't support 8K or even 4K, then why shoot in these super-high resolution formats? Is it a gimmick?\"\nNo, it's not a gimmick! The millions of extra pixels in 8K give us 2 major advantages:\n#1 INCREDIBLE IMAGE QUALITY\n8K cameras produces INCREDIBLE VIDEO QUALITY - especially when viewed on a HD 1080p monitor. This is the format Hollywood movies are shot in. NOTHING comes close!\n#2 CLOSEUP ACTION WITHOUT PIXELIZATION\nFor miniature painting videos, the real advantage is what we can do with the footage AFTER we have recorded it. We have MILLIONS of extra pixels we can zoom-in or pan around without having to create \"new\" pixels that don't exist in the original image (viewed at 1080p).\nBasically, we can get closer to the miniature than ever before! No more craning your neck and squinting your eyes to see what the painter is doing!\nWe are the people behind Master Of Anatomy - a publishing company that creates art books with artists from Disney, Pixar, Sony Animation, Marvel and DC Comics.\nWe've worked with some of the world's best artists like Adam Hughes, Joe Madureira, J. Scott Campbell, Kim Jung Gi, Adam Hughes, Loish, Humberto Ramos, Pascal Campion and Derek Laufmann.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our seventh Kickstarter and we've learned a lot about communication and transparency with our backers.

Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws. You can find your local sales tax rate here: https://taxify.co/state-resource-map/. Please note that in some states we may opt to use a single nexus point and collect the same rate for the whole state, as allowed by local law. \nClick here to see tax rates in Canada.\nWe collect and remit HST (which includes GST and PST), and QST as required by Canadian law. The amount will vary by province and territory, so please reference this guide for more details and to see your local rate: https://www.retailcouncil.org/resources/quick-facts/sales-tax-rates-by-province/ \nWe collect and remit VAT as required by UK law.

Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent.

You will choose the language of your rewards during the pledge manager phase [suivez ce lien pour toutes les infos en fran\u00e7ais !]\nEncyclopedia Standard Edition included in the $40 reward tier\nEncyclopedia in a Nutshell\nEncyclopedia is a 360-page lore book for your 5th Edition campaign, including dozens of ready-to-use cities, locations, NPCs, plot hooks, and magic items for your next game session.\n As a game master, you have a lot to do. Planning, writing, sometimes drawing, and much more!  We've been GMs for over 20 years and we are here to help. With this book, we wanted to offer you as much material as possible to make your job as a GM easier. Prepare your next game session or upgrade your worldbuilding by picking from the Encyclopedia\u2019s rich contents and cook up your own unforgettable stories!\nEncyclopedia Red Dragon Deluxe Edition included in the $70 reward tier and up\nDownload a 40-page Preview of the Encyclopedia\nTo download the 40-page preview of the Encyclopedia, click the following link. If you like what you see, back us to allow us to create more :)\nWork on the Encyclopedia started in France in 2016. It took our studio four years to put together the 360 pages and hundreds of artworks depicting the cities, places, magic items, and NPCs within. The book is now translated and in the very last steps of proofreading and formatting for PDF. We plan to deliver a final version of the Encyclopedia PDF at the end of the campaign.\nCities and Places of Adventure\nAcross this book, you will find 15 cities and many locations ready to serve as the settings of your next adventures. Each of these places has its own identity, featuring many adventure hooks and dozens of memorable figures, both friends and foes: a kobold mining village, a diabolist city, a necropolis-city, a hobgoblin pirate port, and more! The Free City, described over 40+ pages, is split into 15 districts, which you can use separately, as the locales of urban adventures, or as part of a teeming metropolis.\nThis toolbox is perfect for veteran game masters who want to level up their homebrew campaign, as well as for beginners seeking readily usable content to begin their first campaign. This book can also be used as a campaign setting to play in a universe steeped in Sword & Sorcery and portraying colorful civilizations.\n\nLevel-up Your Next Story\nEncyclopedia offers colorful and diverse game material spanning 4 civilizations, each highly distinct from the others. Every one has its own atmosphere, its own mysteries, and its own antagonists.\nA meditating orc of the Iruuls - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nOne of our main objectives was to step away from the tropes of classic fantasy, where orcs and other 'greenskins' are brutish and inherently evil. Here, orcs have cultures of their own, including pacifistic ones like the Iruul orcs, and hobgoblins have a thriving culture of trading.\n\nCoat of arms of the Garden City\nYou can draw inspiration from these civilizations or use them as-is in a campaign of your creation\u2026 or you can feature them in the setting of Eana, which gathers them all!\n Free City. Join the guilds and schemes of the Free City, a cosmopolitan metropolis filled with many mysteries!\n Drakenbergen. Discover legendary valleys with hidden ancient ruins, majestic fjords, dwarven mines, raging volcanoes, and the vampiric kingdom of Kentigern, all nestled in the sprawling mountains of the Drakenbergen!\n Septentrion. Sail for faraway Bore\u00efa, the gateway to the Septentrion, and explore these frozen northern lands, populated with fearsome frost giants and holding a portal to the frozen plane of Gemoniae!\n Kaan. Ride across the steppes of Kaan, venturing into baroque, contrasted, thriving, decadent city-states. Barter with the pirates of Tili\u2019s Gulf or the shrewd merchants of Lihy\u00e2n as you bear witness to past, present, and future empires!\nA traveling hobgoblin merchant - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nEncyclopedia is your new cookbook for your next game sessions ^^\nMagic Items\nEncyclopedia includes more than fifty magic items. Each is tied to one of the locations or personalities described in the book, providing adventure hooks and springboards for new adventures.\nYou will also find 5 optional rules to customize the use of magic items in your campaign:\n Enchanted gems. Set magic gems in weapons and armor to grant them special, unique properties!\n Magic weapon sheaths. Keep the destructive power of your weapons under control with suitable sheaths.\n War paints. In preparation for battle, draw from the ancestral might of these magic Kaani war paints.\n Magic pearls. Discover the pearls of the stone giants, which enable them to go unnoticed!\n Progressive mirafaction. Under the influence of fate and the extreme energies they are subjected to, the personal belongings of adventurers can gradually become magic items. What used to be a fine sword, a family legacy, progressively turns into a more fearsome weapon, imbued with enchantments that will become manifest at key moments of the adventurer\u2019s tribulations!\nModular System\nEncyclopedia makes use of a modular system that lets each game leader define the atmosphere they wish to create for their stories. Each of the symbols listed below indicates related optional rules, adventures hooks, and setting elements that the leader can choose to make use of within a given campaign. Do you want your game to fit the canons of heroic fantasy? Use the rules labeled \u201cAction\u201d to make the adventurers all the more powerful and successful. Do you want to play a dark-fantasy, survival-oriented game? \u201cDark\u201d and \u201cGritty\u201d options have been designed for you and will give adventurers a hard time. \nModular System Icons\nHere are three examples: \n Action. This icon indicates all the rules, magic items, and situations that offer epic options and emphasize the characters\u2019 feats and achievements.\n Corruption. The Corruption icon shows situations and magic items that lead to corruption, or which are only relevant to a corrupted creature.\n Dark. The optional rules, magic items, and situations indicated by this icon are all related to horror, madness, or corruption.\nSpice up your next campaign!\nStretch Goals!\nThe base goal will support the book\u2019s printing. Beyond that, we have several bonuses and upgrades planned to thank you for your support. To ensure a reasonable delivery schedule, all the bonuses of this campaign have already been designed. Your support will enable us to manufacture them and, most of all, send them to backers at no extra charge!

This addition is primarily designed for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, but also functions as a huge collection of inspiring rooms, characters and more! \nEach of these taverns can be enjoyed by any adventurer, and can be scattered across any setting! Ranging from the grim and seedy dealings in the Bloated Bounty to the world shaping Wildaback Tavern, the diversity of each tavern and inn\u2019s culture is a spectacle of its own.\nThese taverns come populated with a slew of characters, some of which can be found at any location. In addition, these buildings house a wide array of monstrous foes, magic items of varying power, and new mechanics!\nThis book is more than it seems. These taverns are laced with their own secrets, hidden histories and locked doors. But more than internal stories, the book itself serves as a guide to the hidden lore of its most prevalent characters. If you\u2019re interested in code cracking, treasure hunting and deep lore, this book is for you!\nFor the most secrets included, it\u2019s suggested you get at least the Tavern Keeper tier, but the main puzzle can be unravelled by anyone with the hardcover! \nOne of our taverns simply can\u2019t be contained inside the pages. Because it changes shape every time you visit! Using dozens of room tiles and a table with descriptions, have your players run through a potentially endless maze of rooms. If you add the arcane haze variant, filling every guest's mind with rage, you can potentially use this tavern as a standalone roguelike board game! \nIf you grab our custom card deck, you can fully immerse yourself in a newly designed game for standard playing cards. Pick your character from the court members, or the joker, and race your opponents on your own trail to victory!\nAdd-ons are a great way to get an extra item or two from a higher pledge, or previous campaign at a Kickstarter rate! All backers will have access to addons, all you have to do is back a tier of this campaign to be invited. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we'll reach out to you and ask you to confirm through the survey which addons you would like to purchase. Shipping costs for addons will be determined after the Kickstarter along with the survey. Addons from this campaign will ship along with pledges. However, backers who select any addon from Stibbles\u2019 Codex (list below) will have the option to receive these select addons earlier - estimated delivery in April 2021. Specific information on this process will be available in post-Kickstarter project updates. \nThe Seeker\u2019s Guide to Twisted Taverns\nPDF     $25\n  Hardcover    $40\n  Tavern Maps    $18\n  Quest Board    $14\n  Deck of Cards    $20\n  Dice     $15\n  Stein     $20\n  Coaster Set    $15\n  Enamel Pin Set   $15\n  Modular Tavern   $35\n  Special Edition Dice & Case  $60\n  Special Edition Book   $120\n  The Seeker Fabric Plushie   $20\n  Goblin Conductor Plushie   $20\n  Tavern Style GM Screen   $18\n  Stibbles Codex of Companions\nPlushies (Each)   $25\n  Companion Cards     $17\n  Mimcat Deck & Box   $35\n  PDF     $25\n  Hardcover    $40\n  Miniatures    $30\nThe campaign is being completed in partnership with Ghostfire Gaming - a premier TTRPG publisher, designer, and manufacturer. Ghostfire is best known for their flagship setting Grim Hollow, as well as their involvement in creating Stibbles Codex of Companions. We are very excited to be working together again!\nEach backer of The Seekers' Guide to Twisted Taverns will have exclusive access to our playtest period. Playtests will be released in PDF form at a later date, after the Kickstarter. This is a great way to get your hands on early content, play through the various taverns, and shape how they develop via our feedback surveys. We will be providing more information about how to join in on playtests after the Kickstarter.\nThis campaign offers worldwide shipping and will be collected after the campaign via the pledge manager BackerKit.

The instant we cross that line, an adventure module by Troll Lord Games becomes unlocked for our backers! TLG is a company known for their fantastic modules, and we know you'll love this one, too.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons: Stories players dive deeper into the lore of Aughmoore. \nThe Stories expansion introduces a new Story Mode that has Heroes completing Side Quests and adventuring deeper into the dungeon, descending Multiple Floors and eventually fighting multiple Dungeons Bosses at once!\nIn addition, Stories offers a slew of new Heroes, Loot, Dungeon Rooms, Dungeon Bosses, Minions, and Goblins! \nThe Stories expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Dungeons. It will share the same length and height as well.

VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will be a separate line item in CrowdOx. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

This Kickstarter is for our new product: Liquid Core Spindowns! These dice have a sequential number placement for tracking life/damage in games such as Magic: The Gathering.\nOur process includes 3D printing masters, making molds, pouring resin, hand painting numbers, and talking endlessly about dice. Our dice are 34mm in size. They are filled with a top secret mixture of liquid, coloring agents, & other high quality stuff.\nWe started creating these as a result of \u201cquarantine project syndrome\u201d in March of last year. Since then we\u2019ve been developing, experimenting, and honing our craft in our basements and garages. Now, our product has become high enough quality that we feel it can no longer be kept from the rest of the world but we need your help. We\u2019re passionate about hand crafting artisan dice. The reason behind the dedication? Because it\u2019s fun, and gamers need more sparkle in their lives. Supporting our project will allow us to source the highest quality sparkle at volume pricing and it will fund continued research into developing the best liquid core dice possible\n\n\n\nThe reward tiers are simple: all pledges are the same price, but each tier is for a different shipping month. Each $39 pledge includes one liquid-core spindown in your choice of color.  As is typical with handmade items, it takes time to craft dice that measure up to our quality standards. We inspect every dice thoroughly, in order to guarantee each shipment is the best of the lot. Choose one color from the below options. \n Color Options:\nRose Pearl \nCerulean \nTwilight \nBlaze \nEmerald\nBe on the lookout for our \"Color Feature Updates\" that we will be releasing every few days. Check out the updates section for more photos and video. \nMost Recent Color Feature:\n\nStretch Goals\nTwo stretch goals have been created and they are big! When the total pledge level has reached $4000 a new color option will be made available to all backers to choose from. Then again at $5000 another color will be added to the choices. These colors are truly some of our newest and most exciting!\nUPDATE: Since we've reached $4k and $5k stretch goals already, we have created two more at $8k and $10k. At each of those goals a new color will be unlocked.\nUPDATE UPDATE: We've hit our $8k goal! Only one left!\nLAST STRETCH GOAL UPDATE: \"10K\" Gold is revealed.

Add-ons make it easy to add items to your pledge during the Kickstarter campaign when you want to mix and match items from multiple reward tiers in an unusual way (or at least, in a way the Kobolds did not anticipate!). If you want a copy of the Limited Edition, you must select that as the base reward; it is not available as an add-on.\nFor example, if you want the Limited Edition hardcover + PDF, and you also want a copy of the regular edition and both a Shard license and a Roll20 license, you will have the option to add those as add-ons to your Limited Edition package after you select your pledge level.\nThe add-ons for this project are limited to the physical book produced as part of this project. Per Kickstarter policy, we will not be offering add-on items from prior Kobold Press Kickstarters.\nThe books, PDF, and VTTs will all release in late October per the current schedule. Given how far along we are with design, development, editing, and art, this is a reasonable schedule.\nAt the same time, we're going to take a serious risk with international shipping for this project. Despite the difficulties we encountered getting Tome of Beasts 2 to backers in a timely way and the increasing costs of international shipping, we're offering the printed books as part of the Kickstarter globally. Shipping costs will be calculated separately from the Kickstarter itself and charged in a pledge manager. \nThis project will use bulk shipments to Canada, the EU, the UK, and Australia to attempt to reduce shipping costs. Given the confusion around VAT in the EU and UK shipments right now, this is a serious risk. Overseas backers may be required to pay VAT or Customs fees, but the cost of postage itself is usually lower using bulk shipping. This form of shipping means overseas packages will arrive a month or two later than US shipments.\nAs is always the case with a Kobold Press project, if we exceed our initial funding goal, we will expand the contents of Vault of Magic through fun and value-added stretch goals. The greater your level of support, the better the book becomes. How many will we hit? The funnest part is finding out! Below, you can see the many, many goals reached with your support!\nFabled Items: We're introducing some new styles of items in Vault of Magic. More information is available on this in the \"What is a Fabled Item?\" update.\nGuest Designer Items: We'll reveal items by our guest designers to our backers as stretch goals, and some guest designers will discuss them on the Kobold Chat Twitch show. You will find 21 guest designers in all, with their item previews posted under Updates.\nOur final run of stretch goals is spelled out below. It's been a huge run, our single most successful project ever--even bigger than the Tome of Beasts!\nWe found one more goal: every great book needs a great bookmark!\n\nWe're incredibly proud of the creative team that has been working on Vault of Magic for 5th Edition the last year and more. Here are a few of the primary contributors:\nJeff Lee, Designer. Jeff has been a gamer for 39 years and a freelance game designer for the last seven years. He has produced material for Gun Metal Games, Legendary  Games, Louis Porter Jr. Design, and Rogue Genius Games, among many others. Jeff is the author of Demon Cults & Secret Societies and 12 Peculiar Towers from Kobold Press.\nPhillip Larwood, Designer. Phillip has been writing for Kobold Press on and off for more than a decade and has a deep, abiding love for all things magical and mysterious. He excelled at aberrations,  fiends, and horrors in his contributions to Tome of Beasts and Tome of Beasts 2, and he further expanded our knowledge of alkemancy and magical servitors in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. Many of the fantastic items in this book are a result of his great penmanship and warped imagination, and his hand-typed manuscripts always smell faintly of cinnamon and myrrh.\nMeagan Maricle, Lead Editor. Meagan was the lead editor on Kobold Press's upcoming City of Cats, Margreve Player\u2019s Guide, Underworld Player\u2019s Guide, Empire of the Ghouls, Tome of Beasts 2, and the ENnie award-winning Creature Codex. When not saving kobolds from their own word traps, she schemes the demise of her players\u2019 characters while petting her diabolical, furry companion (\u201cI\u2019ll get you next time, PCs!\u201d). She has been playing (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since the early 90s when her parents turned her into an emerald wyrmling.\nMarc Radle, Art Director. Marc has been the Art Director and lead graphic designer at Kobold Press  since 2012. He's done the art direction, layout, and graphic design on  hundreds of Kobold Press releases. Marc also occasionally squeezes in time to write\u2014he penned the Shadows of the Dusk Queen adventure and was the lead designer on the New Paths Compendium, both from Kobold Press. He's been playing D&D since the late 70s, along with plenty of other great RPGs\u2014Pathfinder,  Marvel Superheroes, Champions, Elfquest, FASA\u2019s Star Trek, Star  Frontiers . . . the list goes on and on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped over 37 crowdfunded titles since 2006, both small and large, with 17 of them on Kickstarter (this is #19). The Kobolds have won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work, most recently an ENnie for the Creature Codex for 5th Edition in 2019 as Best Monster/Adversary book. The creative team is experienced, and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Vault of Magic, the item design is already done and with the editor. Likewise, we already have the cover and a portion of the interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book. \n\nThe main challenges are layout and proofing of the books, and managing the uncertain landscape for printing and shipping.\n\nOther risks include the new ones: the health of the core team of kobolds (editor, art director, and publisher), as well as business-related risks from COVID-related printer delays plus the recent tampering with the US Post Office. We'll keep you informed on any delays if they arise. \n\nAnd if some dangerous magic is unleashed by our rash experiments in the wizard's chambers?

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set. An advantage of this pledge is the brushes are at a great price, ready to be shipped and will be sent out right away!

Terrain Tinker has been developed with Printable Scenery over the last year to create a practical terrain building application that uses all of the Printable Scenery OpenLOCK collection. When you're finished designing, you can export your creation as a print-ready combined model or separate OpenLOCK parts.\nClick here try the beta version of Terrain Tinker. Free access to the beta will only be available for the duration of the kickstarter.\n\nThe most important aspect of any 3D builder is the quality of the models. Printable Scenery offers the best collection of OpenLOCK parts in all the worlds.\nDesign complex dungeons and buildings, then export as either combined high-quality & detail STL files or OpenLOCK parts.\nSort through your OpenLOCK tiles, then 'drag and drop' to quickly create layouts. Use the intuitive smart-tools to move, copy, paste and construct elaborate designs.\nDrag and drop full-colour building tiles so you can see how your 3D prints will look when painted.\nIt only takes a couple of minutes to learn how to use Terrain Tinker. Check out the videos to see how easy and fun it is to use.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n                Printed and Painted examples of builds with the full Clorehaven set\nSome examples of the models that can be made with the Clorehaven set.\nRampage Castle combined with Clorhaven\nGoblin Grotto parts combined into one printable file\nTerrain Tinker is a partnership project with Printable Scenery. You will soon be able to link to your Printable Scenery account and access your OpenLOCK files directly via the Terrain Tinker interface. Once the campaign closes we will send you a link so that you can link your Printable Scenery account to Terrain Tinker\nThe new OpenLOCK Digital format allows parts to be combined into a single object for 3D printing in Terrain Tinker. This will make it easy for the hundreds of OpenLOCK designers to import their own OpenLOCK tiles into Terrain Tinker.\nWe will be working in collaboration with other OpenLOCK and 3D scenery designers to offer the largest range we can.\nThe www.terraintinker.com Beta is running smoothly, but we want to add more features and more high-detailed tiles.\nWe have a few things already planned and underway including;\nCutting & grouping for 3D printing.\nSend your creation to licensed printers for printing and delivery to your door.\nWe have already unlocked a lot of crazy features. See the stretch goals below to track the progress:\n Unlocking all of the Printable Scenery's OpenLOCK tiles! CLORHAVEN, CASTLE, DUNGEON, GROTTO, and CATHEDRAL UNLOCKED \nScatter placement - the ability to place scatter terrain anywhere in the builder. UNLOCKED  \nImport your own STL files into the builder. UNLOCKED \nObject collision detection. UNLOCKED \nTop-down isometric renders, for printing on paper. UNLOCKED \nA sharing platform to share your designs with others who have the same collections.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

We are Plastic Dungeon, a new 3D printing company. Moreover, we're a group of avid tabletop role-playing gamers who have recently discovered the exciting possibilities available now that 3D printing is becoming more accessible to small businesses.\nA Stone Portal/Arch\nSince it's our goal to make gaming accessories that are, well, accessible, we're starting with a Make 100 project to fund production of a unique piece of fantasy TTRPG terrain. The archway pictured in the image above will be created with PLA filament, and is our own unique design. The archway can be easily incorporated into most other tabletop RPG map sets, and is 28-32mm (heroic) scale. The model can be used as-is, or can easily be primed and painted, as shown in the following images.\nPrinted Sample of \"Stone Portal\" (painted and unpainted)\nPlastic Dungeon\nTable top gaming has long been, and continues to be, an exercise in imagination, but the practical side of the hobby has resulted in the need for drawing endless maps to make our imagined realms a semi-reality. Premade manufactured pieces were costly and often a luxury the average gamer could not afford. Some players could craft their own items, but this required skill not every player possessed, and not everyone wanted to devote the time and effort for a piece which may only be used once or twice.\nEnter the world of 3D printing. Now, suddenly, it's possible to create entire modular maps for use with tabletop RPGs and strategy wargames in such a way that even a small company could inexpensively mass-produce map and terrain pieces. Imagine- custom 3D maps with personalized details that can affordably be created on-demand. This is what Plastic Dungeon is all about. We've had some amazing successes already building custom items for our own gaming group, as well as our Friendly Local Game Store, but now, we're hoping to begin reaching for that dream of mass-production of customizable gaming terrain.\n3D render of \"Stone Portal\"\nRune Detail (Updated)\nWe Need Your Help\nThat's where the Kickstarter comes in. We're creating our own unique designs, which can be modified upon request to suit a specific or unique purpose. The first piece we've designed, a stone archway with arcane markings, is being made ready for production. We're currently working on more designs for large maps sets and customizable gaming accessories, and we've love to hear suggestions from everyone about what they'd like to see. Certain types of pieces, specific settings, even features of the design. We're still new and open to anything!\n\n We're offering the stone arch at the cost of $3 per piece, and you can order up to five.  We also now have several Add-On options for purchase, including Painting at an additional $3 per arch, and Inserts at a cost of $1 per insert. The arch with Inserts is ideal for adapting to a variety of maps and games, and can be anything: a secret passageway, a mystical dimensional portal, or the entrance to an ancient fortress. We sincerely hope this will add that extra touch of interest and flair to your gaming maps!\n\nShipping - $3 to anywhere in the USA!\nWhen creating this Kickstarter we did not anticipate the interest in multiple arches, and so our shipping cost is based on a specific packaging. It's possible to pledge for far more than will fit in this package and multiple packages may need to be sent to fulfill such a pledge. While not required, we'd appreciate any pledges for 4 or more arches, or 10 or more inserts, to include an additional $3 to accommodate shipping a 2nd package. This is not required! We're thrilled for the enthusiastic interest and being able to provide you with our arches and inserts is payment enough, but the extra to accommodate shipping would still be very much appreciated.\nPainting - $3 Per Arch\nNot a pro at painting? We're happy to do it for you! Simply raise your pledge an additional $3 per arch, and we will send them to you fully primed and painted. Painting will consist of a dark basecoat, several layers of gray midtones, highlights and a finish coat. With our social stretch goals successful, we'll also paint in the detail of the runes at the top of the arch in a bright, contrasting color.\n\nAdditional Portal Inserts - $1 Per Insert\nSince we have developed a portal arch with insert capability, we're offering a few of our alternative portal inserts as Add-Ons.  These designs are different from the brightly-colored portal inserts, and are obtainable only by pledging for the Add-On. (Once unlocked, the magical portal inserts will be available at no extra cost, one per portal arch. After that goal has been reached, any of the portal insert designs, including the magical designs, can be purchased at the $1 Add-On price.) At this time, we are offering an option for heavy wooden doors, a lattice-style portcullis, a spiderweb, a magical tendril border effect, and burst of energy as if a portal were just opening or closing. You may pledge for one of each design per arch, at $1 each. Again, if you pledged for painting the original piece, the painting of one insert of your choice per painted arch will be covered at no additional cost. (Note: Some Inserts are not intended to be painted, such as the Ripple, Web, Tendril, and Burst designs.)\n\nPortcullis and Doors inserts, fully painted (mini not included)\nWeb and Burst Inserts\nTendril Insert\n Now that we're funded (and then some), we've added some stretch goals!\nMore details about each goal will be added as we approach them.\n\n $200 Painted Option- Unlocked!\nWe are so grateful for your response that we've decided to officially offer an add-on to paint your arches a dark stone grey, similar to how the sample images appear further up this page. Simply raise your pledge an additional $3 per arch, and we will send them to you fully primed and painted. You'll be able to tell us how many you paid to have painted in the survey at the end of the campaign, along with any other options that become unlocked in our Stretch Goals!\n $500 Portal Insert- Unlocked!\nWe are very exited for our next stretch goal: a portal piece that can be inserted into the arch to turn it into an active portal! Help us get to $500 funded and we will include this portal piece with every arch at no additional cost. Paid for painting? We'll paint this for you as well!\n$800 Another Portal Insert and Translucent Filament Option\nWe've decided to combine the next two stretch goals! At $800 pledged we will offer an alternate second design of portal insert for every arch you pledge for! You can select your portal design in the survey. The portal inserts will be printed in a random bright filament, but once we reach $800 we will offer the option to choose the color of your portal inserts, including translucent filament!\n\n$1200/$1600/$2000 Mystery Goals! \nReach these to find out what they are!\n\nSocial Goals\n\nWe also have some social network goals! Visit us on Facebook to like our page and share our post about this Kickstarter!\nAlternate Rune Designs- Unlocked!\nSince our Facebook page has 100 likes, we will open the option to choose between our original runes detailed above or the alternate runes featured in our second update \"Updated Runes\".\nContrasting Rune Colors- Unlocked!\nSince the post has 100 shares, the painting add-on will include painting the runes in a contrasting color! This includes the option to have the runes glow under black light, which looks very cool. Pictures of an arch under black light are available in our update \"Getting Closer!\".\n\nWe're excited about our first mass run, and hope to get the gaming community excited about our company, and good things to come!\nThanks in advance for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEstimated delivery is a rough estimate based on the time it will take to produce and ship.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nPLA plastic or polylactic acid is a vegetable-based plastic material, which commonly uses cornstarch as a raw material.

Leave the troubles of the road outside and have a seat by the fire. Welcome to a project that is certain to help you put the worries of the outside world at bay. Black Oak Workshop is proud to return to Kickstarter with our 2021 lineup of Advent-ure Calendars! The Holiday Tavern and the 2020 Calendars were well received and we have returned with new themes to ensure there is something for everyone. 2020 is GONE and we are excited to kick off 2021 with some polyhedral adventure!\nDue to the positive response last year, we are returning with three all new calendars this year. The goal with three is to allow choices for our backers. Not everyone celebrates the Christmas holiday that is associated with traditional Advent calendars, so we present an additional holiday themed calendar (Halloween) as well as offering a calendar that is not specifically tied to any holiday. This allows everyone a way to countdown with cool dice.\nWe've got some wonderful surprises for everyone included in each calendar. There are some new, extra large dice and an altogether custom shape which is very exciting! Our costs were impacted as a result, but we only had to increase prices marginally over previous calendars. In addition to the cool new sizes and shapes you will discover this year, we're including a bonus, thematic item in each of the calendars designed to match the theme. Read on adventurers!\nAdvent-ure Calendars are filled with custom polyhedral dice that follow a theme. Our calendars are inspired by traditional advent calendars and they help you count down your holidays or any other event while celebrating a love of dice. Each day, a new chamber is opened and inside you will find custom polyhedral dice that feature all new, never before seen designs. You will never find old overstock dice or standard mass produced sets in our calendars!\nOnce again, we have commissioned the Fraim Bros to do our box art and we feel they really brought the magic to this project - the artwork is gorgeous!! Check out these beautiful calendars!\nAdvent-ure Calendar 5: The Dragon's Lair The dark and foreboding cave entrance warns of terrible dangers within! Do you have the courage to draw your sword and press onward to discover untold treasures? Beware the dragon that lies within! Count down to any special date with these cool dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 3\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 24\nDimensions: 13.2 x 8.8 x 1.7 (in)\nMSRP: $65\nAdvent-ure Calendar 6: The Deathgale Galleon Storm clouds foretell the coming of the haunted galleon! The crew is said to be cursed and will forever sail the seas in search of new prey. Do you dare board the ship and discover dark mysteries inside the barnacled hull? Count down to Halloween with these not-so-terrifying dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 4\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 31\nDimensions: 15.5 x 11.2 x 1.75 (in)\nMSRP: $75\nAdvent-ure Calendar 7: Santa's Workshop The dream destination of children all around the world is certain to hold a great many magical surprises! Come inside and see what Santa has been working on with his elves! Count down to Christmas with these holiday themed dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 3\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 24\nDimensions: 13.2 x 8.8 x 1.7 (in)\nMSRP: $65\n We hope you think these themes are as exciting as we do!\nAs with our previous Advent-ure Calendars, we are steadfastly choosing not to reveal images of the dice inside to preserve the magic and fun of opening a countdown style calendar. However, we can tell you the following:\n Big! All the dice are larger Black Oak sized dice - these are big and fun to roll!\n Bigger! We are introducing some special over-sized (even for Black Oak) dice in two of the calendars this year.\n Exclusive! All the dice feature entirely new custom designs and they are not available anywhere else - these dice are exclusive to this project!\n More Exclusive! We have an entirely new dice shape for one of our calendars this year! Hint: Have you been naughty or nice this year?\n Variety! Each of the dice are unique. Other than the possibility of set pairs, there are no duplicates of the dice inside. Also, you will never find our old stock in these calendars - we don't use them to thin out stuff that isn't selling well.\n Style! All the dice feature either solid, swirl, transparent or glitter styles. And maybe even glow-in-the-dark!\n Thematic! The packaging for each calendar embraces a unique theme and features beautiful artwork to help bring this theme to life. This theme carries over to the dice designs as well.\n Collectible! Except for a few of the dice outlined below (see Special Singles), none of these will be available outside of this project. This is it!\nWe always strive to provide a fantastic product to our backers while also putting a focus on value. We are offering the same exceptional quality as our previous calendars while including a few specialty dice this year (larger and new shapes). As a result, the pricing for the new calendars is slightly higher than last year. Additional calendars in the pledge manager and those available post project on our website will be sold at the MSRP rate.\nWhile we are choosing not to reveal the dice in these calendars for obvious reasons, we can show you dice similar to what you will receive. Below are photos of some of the polyhedral sets from our earlier Advent-ure Calendars.\nAs you can see, the dice in a given calendar come in a mix of designs, but they follow a general theme. Our backers resoundingly loved these dice and we can promise you that the dice featured in the new calendars will be just as cool.\nNo project would be complete without something fun to look forward to. For this project, we are continuing with extras that match the themes we've selected. Please help us spread the word out there so these items can find their way into the world!\nBelow is a text only summary of the project goals:\n $40,000 Funded! **UNLOCKED** All three of the new Advent-ure Calendars are now unlocked. Additional calendars will be available for purchase in the pledge manager.\n $50,000 Dice Bags! **UNLOCKED** The three matching dice bags (one design matching each calendar) are unlocked. All backers will receive one of these dice bags of their choice per calendar backed for (LIMIT 3). These bags are made of the same quality materials as our standard dice bags and are 5.5\" X 8.5\" in size. Additional dice bags will be available for purchase in the pledge manager at a discounted rate.\n $60,000 Mystery Dice Level 1! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have an additional mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n $69,000 Mystery Dice Level 2! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have a SECOND mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n $78,000 Mystery Dice Level 3! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have a THIRD mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n ??? Additional mysterious stretch goals are possible.\nWe will be releasing a few of the dice from the calendars as singles available for a purchase outside of the project. This is because we know they will make cool gifts and our backers may very well want a few extras to throw in their dice bags.\nOut of the 79 dice included on the project, 7 will be available as add-on purchases. There are 2 dice from each calendar that we are revealing and an additional die from the Deathgale Galleon (total 3).\nBelow is a text only summary of the Special Singles:\n Sparky d4 (Dragon's Lair) Who doesn't love cute little dragons? You can use this one to roll or as a marker for your familiar! A tiny flying dragon means you've rolled a 4 on this purple swirl with silver ink d4.\n Dragonstone d20 (Dragon's Lair) The crown jewel of the Dragon's Hoard, this oversized crystal clear d20 (white ink) is a handful! Our standard d20s are scaled to match a 19mm d6, but these d20s are even chunkier. A crystal marks the 20 result.\n Rolling Bones pair of d6s (Deathgale Galleon) These two d6s are black with white ink and have an increasing number of bones to indicate the result with a cool skull as the 6 result. Pirates love them!\n Jib the Monkey d20 (Deathgale Galleon) He's a loyal companion, but you can bet he's looking forward to finding a new home on dry land! This beige swirl and brown ink d20 has a little monkey for the 20 result.\n Giant Christmas Tree d4 (Santa's Workshop) There is always a big Christmas tree standing in Santa's Workshop! This giant sized d4 is almost identical to our d4 in Advent-ure Calendar 1, but it's a LOT bigger!\n Naughty/Nice d2 (Santa's Workshop) This d2 comes in the shape of Santa's book of names. It is a beige swirl with brown ink and this shape is a first for us. Have you been naughty or nice this year?\nIn addition to the singles from the calendars, we have plenty of add-on items to choose from. You can see most of our available products on our website. Most products there as well as a few others will be available as part of the pledge manager process that will begin shortly after the campaign funding period ends.\nBelow is an overview list and general price breakdown of our products:\nAdditional Advent-ure Calendars 5-7 at MSRP\nSpecial Singles Calendar Dice $4 (reduced for backers)\n Rolling Bones pair of d6's (Deathgale Galleon) $8 (reduced for backers)\n Dragonstone Oversized d20 (Dragon's Lair) $11 (reduced for backers)\nCalendar Dice Bags (if unlocked) $10 (reduced for backers)\nBlack Oak Thematic Polyhedrals (singles) $5\nBlack Oak Thematic RPG Sets $15\nAdditional Dice Bags $12\nTotally Geek Pins $8\nYou can choose to add additional funds to your pledge now to cover add-on items or simply add them post project during the pledge manager process.\nFor those of you who have not seen or rolled our dice, we are sure you will be pleasantly surprised. Below is a size comparison of a Black Oak d20 and a standard d20. All of our dice are scaled to match a 19mm (3/4\") d6 instead of a standard 16mm d6. The result is that they have a better feel in your hand and look great when rolling. They are also much easier to read. Note that all of the calendars this year contain an even larger die than our standard size or a specialty shape we have not produced before.\nWe like to be creative and innovate! Last year we introduced a new take on the traditional d4 in some of our calendars. This allows additional design space for the theme while maintaining functionality. The Campfire d4 was one of these. We received an overwhelmingly positive response to this last year and are continuing with the concept this year on more of the d4s.\nYou can back our projects with confidence! Reviewing any of our past projects will reveal we go above and beyond to deliver a great experience to our backers who are the best backers on Kickstarter! We take our commitment to you seriously and you can trust us to deliver. We have shipped on time or early on virtually every one of our projects.\nWhat you see is what you get on this and all of our projects. Black Oak Workshop always strives to show you photo samples of the actual product. We carry an upfront investment to do this so that you can feel safe in helping produce a great product. Below are images of the actual calendars - the product you will receive will be exactly like what you see here!\nUPDATE: We will be shipping internationally for the project with the exception of the United Kingdom. All international shipping costs are to be determined and will be charged in the pledge manager post project.\nAll shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service. Please note that 2021 shipping rate changes have impacted the shipping estimates. Domestic (USA) orders will ship utilizing Priority Mail. International orders will ship utilizing First-Class Package International Service. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping. Tracking numbers are emailed to backers at the email address on file with Kickstarter upon printing of the respective shipping label.\nAll rewards will ship in the month of September 2021. Domestic USA orders should arrive by October 1, but we cannot guarantee that. We have seen some shipments take a few days or 2-3 weeks to reach the end destination due to staffing issues of the USPS. International orders are not guaranteed to arrive by any specific date.\nNOTE: All shipping fees will be collected post the campaign as part of the BackerKit pledge manager process. Please see the shipping matrix below for cost estimates. For the THREE CALENDAR SET (triple pack) and RETAILER ONLY reward levels, we are only shipping to the USA.\nCOVID-19 NOTICE: The delivery timeline and above cost estimates are subject to change based on the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, we feel confident in meeting the delivery schedule and staying close to these cost estimates. However, as the world learned in 2020, things can change quickly. We will always keep our backers updated as to any changes as they develop.\nAre you a verifiable brick and mortar retailer? Would you like to carry the Advent-ure Calendars or any of our other products in your store? We'd love to earn your business! Sales for our retailers on our previous Advent-ure Calendar projects were fantastic and we only had one complaint: they wanted more to be available than we were able to provide! This will not be an issue on this project! Note that online based retailers are not permitted. \nSimply back at the 'Retailer Only' level and, if this is your first time backing a Black Oak project, contact us through the creator contact area of the Kickstart page or through our website here so we can verify you as a brick and mortar retail store. Your pledge will serve as a credit towards your selections in the pledge manager. Qualified retailers receive a wholesale rate on all our products and all products will be available in the pledge manager for you at wholesale rates. The suggested MSRP for the Advent-ure Calendars are $65 (24 chambers/custom dice) and $75 (31 chambers/custom dice). Note that if additional 'mystery dice' are unlocked, they will be incorporated into the calendars, though the MSRP will not change.\nNOTE: Costs for shipping to retailers will be based on quantities ordered and will be determined at the time of shipment. Final shipping costs for retailers will not be handled in the pledge manager.\nThank you for checking out our latest project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency.

Reinhart (right) & Adrian Benson (left)\n\nHi, we're Jonathan and Adrian.  We are the hosts of Wargaming Recon.  Wargaming Recon is the longest-running tabletop wargaming podcast in existence.\n\nLast year we asked for your help to bring the 2020 season to life.  The COVID-19 global pandemic hit hard after our Kickstarter ended.  Convention after convention closed, game days postponed, businesses shut down, and many people were furloughed or lost their jobs.\n\nThose many months in 2020 were dark times for people across the globe.  We adapted to the unprecedented times by changing our plans for 2020.  Instead of giving you a year's worth of event coverage, we pivoted to help the community the best way we could.  \n\nWe doubled-down on addressing how tabletop gaming is a tool in the battle for good mental health.  We began a daily livestream show during the worst of the pandemic.  We co-created and co-sponsored the 2020 Let's Roll virtual gaming convention.\n\nLet's Roll 2020 brought together gamers and game companies from across the globe.  Using a multitude of online platforms to play, to communicate, to learn, and to hang out, we helped over 70 people to fight the sense of isolation and fear of uncertainty that pervaded society.\n\nThe challenges of 2020 forced us to be more adaptable, nimble, and responsive than ever before.  The 2021 season is shaping up to be unlike anything we've ever experienced in our more than 14 years of bringing you informative, recreational, and educational podcast episodes covering all aspects of our hobby.  We intend to use our experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic as we bring the 2021 season to you.\n\nWe wish to continue exploring the changing scene of tabletop games with a brighter spotlight on remote gaming, solo gaming, and using technology to play games with people anywhere on the planet.  Old favorites such as play by mail or e-mail are coming back all the way to using virtual meetings and virtual tabletops to game with one another.\n\nIn the past, we'd interview individuals in person like award winning filmmakers Steve Wollett about Word From a Gamer, talented game designers like GMT's Mark McLaughlin, Parsec finalist podcasters like Peter Bryant & Mike Kafes of the Mythwits, first-rate convention organizers like Steve & Angelia Parenteau of TotalCon, and internationally known minis painters like Tony Rieger & Dave Shuster of Iron Hammer Studio.\n\nAs we learned from COVID-19, that isn't always the best method.  We're putting more resources into online interviews using tools like Streamyard and Streamlabs OBS to blur the lines between audio recordings and web shows.  We began using Streamyard for our daily Pandemic Coffee Break shows.  It allows us to integrate audience feedback, feature web content, and showcase products in a better visual way to accompany our audio podcast.\nPandemic Coffee Break 6/5/2020\nOur 2020 season was, in part, the year of mental health.  Our openness has strongly resonated with people as evidenced by the numerous dialogues resulting from that change.  While we've always sought to help others, we are making mental health a core value moving forward.  In particular we will continue our mission to normalize mental health.  One way we're doing this is to use our social media presence to nurture and support one another.  We think of it as a safe space for members of the community to speak their truth without fear of ridicule.  From time to time we'll check in with a mental health professional to offer tips as to how tabletop gaming can be a helpful tool in your mental health first aid kit.\nDr. Allan Hunter spoke about how tabletop gaming can help one's mental health\nEveryone loves the excitement that comes from what the major companies are doing.  But, the smaller companies are often contributing to the hobby in innovative ways such as breathing life into more niche game settings or exploring unique ways to use 3D printing.  During COVID, many small businesses faced financial uncertainty or even went out of business..  A large percentage of the tabletop gaming industry consists of mom and pop shops.  For 2021, we want to give these smaller businesses a voice.  We will introduce you to companies and products with which you may not be entirely familiar.  There's often something exciting to encounter when one least expects it.\n\nWe also want to diversify our content to include under-represented populations.  This new season sees us seeking out those with unique points of view that may challenge expectation.  These voices are not always heard above the cacophony of daily life.  We hope to change that.\n\nTo complete a 2021 podcast season, we can't do it alone.  Wargaming Recon has grown into a multimedia organization featuring our popular podcast (sitting in the top 18-20% of podcasts globally), video content, and blog articles.  We have a variety of expenses from review products, equipment purchases, hosting, and even staff.\n\nWe've tried other funding methods. Even with those methods, we're still unable to cover our costs.  Many expenses come out of my (Jonathan's) pocket.  With two little girls at home, I can no longer afford to pay for these things on my own.\nJonathan vlogged with his daughters\nOur goal of $500 will allow us to produce a shorter 2021 season.  Reaching the stretch goal makes a full season a reality.\n\nFor the 2021 season we're offering a variety of pledge levels.  Some were popular last time around and some are new.  One of the new pledge levels helps backers to get new swag.  Ultimately, this is about you helping us to help you with great content. The Pandemic has everyone scrambling and dealing with the rough reality of life--our podcast is an escape from that, and we'd love for you to join us.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing an example of what you can expect from our podcast, check out what we do at Wargaming Recon's website. For now, onto what you can expect from our backer levels, and an idea of what tokens of appreciate you'll receive for supporting our work!\n Backer Levels\n\n New Merch\nMen's/Unisex black t-shirt in sizes Small-3XL with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nMen's/Unisex black polo shirt in sizes Small-5XL with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nWomen's black t-shirt in sizes Small-2XL with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nDuffel bag in black with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nIn 2021, we plan to have more of what you love such as product reviews, guests discussing game design, and evergreen content.  But, we're also going to update topics from the earliest days of the show by exposing them to this brave new world.  Most importantly we promise to continue giving you more video content, more social media interaction, and more time to bring YOU the content you love.  None of this is cheap.  But, we do it because we care about this hobby that we all love.  We do it because we care about the tabletop wargaming community.

For over two years now at Reggie Games we have been dedicating our time, experience and passion to this project, both as a team and as individuals. \nA lot of work and effort has already been put into this project so far. The game relies on solid and tested mechanics and almost every piece of art for the project has already been realized by our artists team. \nThat being said, we know we still have a long road ahead to fully complete development and going through mass production and then worldwide shipping. We have great confidence in our manufacturing and fulfillment partners and we spent significant time planning every detail of the project in advance.\nFor these reasons we feel prepared to face and handle any eventual complications and challenges that may arise along the way. \n\nYou can trust that every choice our team makes is dictated by improving the quality of the final product to deliver the best version of Primal: The Awakening to our backers. \n\n\nSHIPPING & ESTIMATED DELIVERY\nWe have already handled freight and worldwide fulfillment as we successfully delivered ELO Darkness, our 1st project, to our backers all around the world.\nNonetheless we\u2019ve also learned production, quality control and shipping are delicate phases of the project. Indeed, unexpected issues could arise and they could take some time to be solved. For this reason the delivery date we are providing at this stage of the project is to be considered an estimate.\nWe will do everything possible to meet this date or even anticipate it, but we are aware that slight delays are possible for reasons outside of our control. \nAlso, please consider that exact delivery dates could vary depending on where you live. For example, your game may arrive earlier if you live in a region close to the factory.\n\nYou can be sure we will keep you informed about every step through the process and we will do our best to solve and overcome any issue that could arise in the fast and efficient way possible.\n\n\nCOVID-19\nThe Pandemic situation is a great challenge for us all. To minimize risks we are working with companies that have a stable position on the market and to the best of our knowledge will not endanger the production and fulfillment of this project. Also we are optimistic that by the time this project is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues with respect to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated about any unexpected issues that may arise.\n\nREFUND\nAfter the end of the campaign, the order can still be canceled (receiving a full refund) within 14 days by sending us an email with your cancellation request. \nAfter that period, you can still receive a refund until we lock the production order for the Kickstarter campaign (within 3-4 weeks after the campaign ends).

They are presented in the picture, and you can choose at the end of the project when you receive a survey.\n You can see the bigger images of engravings HERE \n You can see the bigger images of engravings HERE\nEngraving can be placed on its front part, which will add atmosphere to your gameplay.\nYou can order a black artificial leather dice tray mat. The mat will add style to the entire structure. The mat also mutes the sound of the rolling blocks, if you prefer.\nSo Be Wood's Dice Tower is not just a dice tower ...\nBut a multifunctional gaming accessory that is also a safe place to store all the elements you need to play.\nIts design in the style of the Middle Ages will add the spirit of the era to your games and allow you to completely immerse yourself in the world of the game.\n Clean up the clutter on your gaming table once and for all with Gamer's Chest!\nOur organizer - a product of meticulous engineering thought, and love for what we do - is made of environmentally friendly wood, a material that, with its naturalness and uniqueness of patterns, will not leave any gamer indifferent and will add new colors to the gameplay.\nThis is not an ordinary tower you are accustomed to. It has its own very convenient and exciting features:\nDice Tower closes with a magnetic latch to secure the game components in it from falling out. Its function is to improve reliability, namely to prevent accidental opening of the tower. \nKeep in safe\nThe latch has two degrees of protection: the rotation of the plate of the upper part of the tower ridge and the magnet. When assembled, the dice tray serves as the top cover of the tower and reliably fixes the latch.\nUntil you remove the tray-cover, the latch cannot be rotated. \nThe tower can be used separately, and at the same time, it serves as storage for all of organizer's components.\nIn the standard Full Set it accommodates a combination of:\n\u00b7 Dicebox - 1 pcs\n\u00b7 Simple Tiles - 12 pcs\n\u00b7 Bank Tiles 2 pcs\n\u00b7 Coasters - 4 pcs\nYou can create your personal configuration with any possible combination of modular gaming accessories in any designs. You will tell us the details in the pledge manager.\nDice Tower dimensions:\n\u00b7  Folded - 5.51x6.37x10.63 inches (140x162x270 mm)\n\u00b7  Unfolded - 5.51x6.37x9.84 inches (140x162x250 mm)\nInternal height/capacity of the tower: 8.45 inches (214 mm)\nDice Tray dimensions: thickness of 0.98 inches, the radius of 3.19 inches (25mm thickness, 81mm radius)\nA special slope is made at the top of the tower so that the dice will dive into the hole on any throw. \nDrop your dice!\nThe top cover of the tower serves as a tray for catching dice rolling out of the tower. It resembles a lowered suspension bridge in front of the castle gates, to which the guards run out to defend their castle. In the game, these are rolling cubes that decide the fate of your game.\nHave you ever blamed yourself for a bad roll of the dice? With our tower, you can forget about it and let it decide your fate. 4 levels inside the tower improve the randomness of the results of throwing dice, making them rotate uniquely and change the drop values.\nInstall in a second\nThe distance between the levels (2 inches) is sufficient to roll any number of dice, and they will not get stuck inside.\nThe levels are very easily installed in special grooves inside the tower, then they are ideally folded on top and covered with a dice tray.\n The Dice Tray is conveniently mounted to the tower using two pairs of magnets.\nJust light touch to add\nWhen assembled, the dice tray serves as the top cover of the tower so that the toothed protuberances of the tray fit perfectly into the protrusions of the tower and are also held by 3 pairs of magnets.\nRight place for all items\nBE WOOD modular tiles is a magnetic modular hex tile system that you can use with board games and role-playing games.\nEach tile has magnets installed on the sides of the hexagon so that they can connect to each other and create an interlocking system.\nTiles are multifunctional!\n\n You can mix and match tiles in a way that suits you.\nHexagonal tiles have the same outer dimensions and can be conveniently folded for storage and transportation in the Dice Tower. \nEach tile is provided with a label so that the magnets\u2019 poles are connected to other magnets.\nThere are 12 Simple Tile designs and 4 Bank Tile designs in total. They are shown in the photo, and you will choose the end of the project when you receive a survey from us.\nSimple Tile Dimensions: 0.4 \"thick, 2.28\" radius (10mm thick, 58mm radius)\nBank Tile dimensions: 0.8 \"thick, 2.28\" radius (20mm thick, 58mm radius)\nThis dice box is of the same size as the dice arena and it has removable partitions inside which divide it into 4 segments. \nThe prices the for Dice Box XL start from $30 in Alder, $32 in Maple and Cherry and $35 in Oak.\nIts hexagonal shape perfectly matches your tabletop tiles. It also has thumb notches, so the box is easier to open without spilling out the contents. \nThe lid of the box is securely held by magnetic latches that will not open even if dropped. At the same time, it can be opened quite easily with your thumb. \nThe box is deep, and the inner border holds the lid securely in place.\nDice Box Dimensions: 1.18 \"Thick, 2.28\" Radius (30mm Thick, 58mm Radius)\nInner Dimension: 0.87 \"\nThe coasters are made from the same woods as your other components. Each stand has cork inserts to help protect the wood from condensation or water damage.\nTheir hexagonal shape and dimensions are the same as table tiles, allowing them to blend perfectly on the gaming table and fold into the Dice Tower for storage and transport.\n Coaster Dimensions: 0.2\" thick, 2.28\" radius (5mm thick, 58mm radius)\n All components of the BE WOOD modular system are available in a 4 types of wood.

These dungeon rooms, drawn by Toby Lancaster AKA Dark Realm Maps, are different from your normal subterranean domain though. They show a series of escape rooms where the players must take on a number of physical challenges and solve puzzles. Each one is independent from the other and can easily be slotted into any dungeon. They can be worked into the main story line or exist as a one off challenge.\nA party of adventurers have come to a very different feeling dungeon room. The space is laid out before the players, placed on the table, a colourful map full of detail and peril. Miniatures are placed at the entrance. It is not immediately clear what needs to be done, or whether there is in fact a way out! But whatever it is it involves a series of obstacles and challenges. How are they going to escape the room? They consider going back but a bolt slides into place on the door they just came through and they realise they must move forward\u2026\nAs it says in the title the box contains 10 Maps. They are all as follows:\n1. On A4 (210mm x 297mm) card stock \n2. Full-Colour \n3. Feature an escape room challenge\n4. Has visual clues to how to escape the room\n5. 1 square = 5 foot scale\n6. Each square is 25mm (1 inch) wide\nAlso in the box is a descriptor sheet that explains each room. These are not designed to be overly complicated though.\nDigital copies feature the maps as files which is part of a PDF that includes all maps and additional content.\nEach map is hand drawn, inked in black and then coloured with pencil giving a bespoke  look that has been very popular in a range of publications. As a result Toby has been commission to use this style in the two current hit Kickstarter projects: Midnight Towers \"A Mystery Adventure Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe for 5e\" and Windmill Slam Games \"The Book of Cults for D&D 5e\".\n\nThese maps are designed to be handy! Here are some examples of how and why they might be used:\nThe DM needs to extend a session as the players are progressing too quickly\nYou need a location to hide a key treasure\nThe dungeon needs a focus room or you need new content for your game\nIf the adventurers want something a bit different, as they're a bit bored with the standard dungeon encounter\nA more difficult challange is needed...these have plenty of scope to be made very hard\nYou want to throw something physical into a gaming session to introduce a different playing style\nToby Lancaster is an ENnie nominated cartographer and  active member of the roleplay community contributing content, advice and working with a number of key figures. He operates under the handle of Dark Realm Maps and has had his work published in a long list of products and has produced a range of PDF products in the past which can be found on DMsguild and DrivethruRPG.\n\n \u201cFor years now I have been drawing maps for a range of projects. These include maps for Peterson Games, Midnight Tower\u2019s D&D supplements, Jeff Stevens Games bestselling modules and supplements and Mark Chaplin\u2019s up and coming board game \u2018Where Human\u2019s Don\u2019t Belong\u2019. I love working with these awesome people but as yet I have not created my own map based Kickstarter and I thought it was about time!\u201d\nToby Lancaster\nLimited Edition Postcard Bonus\nIf you like extras with your rewards then you might like this bonus. We are offering up one of Toby's Limited Edition Postcards in one of our tiers. This is the first postcard in the Ancient Structures series called The Wheel House.\nHere is an example of one of the Battle Mats. As you can see there are a series of rooms, a central focus mechanism and electricity flashing from one wall to the next which is controlled by the lever to the right of the door.\n\nThese stretch goal tokens use the same scale as the dungeon rooms in this project and so can be placed anywhere on the maps. They can be used to enhance the story line or serve to hide elements of the map, are produced in full colour and sent with your tier rewards.\nWe are shipping internationally and the postage cost is added to the pledge. We have tried to make this as affordable as possible and having shopped around we think we have found a reasonable price and hope you feel the same too. There is always the option of buying the digital edition as well and this will be sent out via an email on this platform which will include a link from where you can download the maps.\nFollowing Dark Realm Maps\nWe are active on a range of social media:\nTwitter @Darkrealmmaps https://twitter.com/darkrealmmaps\nInstagram @Darkrealmmaps  https://www.instagram.com/darkrealmmaps\nFacebook Page https://www.facebook.com/Dark-Realm-Maps-297212987513285/\nDon't forget to put the word out so we can grow the community. \nOne last thing!\nWe will be uploading some of the black and white versions of the maps, to the updates section of this campaign, for the backers. So even before the product is shipped you will have content to sink your teeth into!\nThank you for your support and for spending the time to ready this. \nToby and Jo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course during these troubled times we all have a few more challenges to deal with. We are trying to reduce these by working with a local printer to avoid customs issues, shipping times and potential lock downs. We have also added more time for printing as this time of year can be very busy.\n\nWe are working hard to finish all the maps, but will be of the usual high standard shown in the three featured here and what has come to be expected from Toby at Dark Realm Maps. They will be finished over the Christmas period. Many of them are in their black and white stages and just need colour.\n\nPostage has been a problem globally with quarantining (especially for Australia) and lock downs so we have allowed for a slightly longer completion time of March for the printed versions, so hopefully you'll receive them before then.

Over the decades of D&D and other TTRPG\u2019s, miniatures have always been a staple for us. So to say that we would eventually try our hand at them was an understatement.\nWith the release of our new book Cursed Lands and the rerelease of Curse of Strahd; we knew our first collection of miniatures had to be gothic horror inspired. \n\nWe set some goals of what we wanted our miniatures to achieve.\nThey had to be the correct size for D&D gameplay. \nThey had to be of high quality.\nThey had to be models we thought were unique or not common.\nAnd they had to be as cool as we could possibly make them! \nSo with those goals in mind, we got to work.\n\n\nRight away we started working with concept artists and 3d sculptors to develop our best ideas. After it was all said and done we had 11 models to bring to the world. These 11 miniatures are gaps in the current D&D market, so we made them ourselves. Our hope is you like them as much as we do.\n\nWhy are there only 5 Miniatures Sculpted?\nThe real answer is, it's a safety net. Producing a mini from start to finish can be very expensive depending on the artists you use, and we have 11 miniatures total. We are incredibly excited for this project, but funding is never guaranteed. \nWe made the decision to have about half of our miniatures sculpted now. The other half will begin the sculpting process as soon as we hit our Kickstarter goal. We already have the concepts done, and our 3D sculptors are ready to go. \n\n\nOur Kickstarter includes 11 different miniature options with thousands of different combinations. So in order to keep it simple, we've made 1 customizable reward tier.\n\nThe \"Custom Tier\" pledge level is a minimum of 10 dollars and one miniature, but it allows you to completely customize your rewards. All you have to do is pick out the miniatures you want. Next add up their costs, and pledge that amount when you back this reward tier. Then when the Kickstarter is over, we'll send you a survey where you can pick out your miniatures.\nFor Example, if I wanted the Werewolf and The Fortuneteller (Both $10 each) as well as the Bone Behemoth ($40). I would add up their costs ($10+$10+$40= $60) and back the custom reward tier at that amount. Then once the survey came in after the Kickstarter ends, I would pick the 3 miniatures I wanted. \nWe've also set up a pricing system that allows you to get a little more bang for your buck. For every 50 Dollars, you spend we'll give you some extra credit on Backer Kit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPainter - Iguazzu Studio\nPainter- Iguazzu Studio\nPainter- Christoph Eichhorn\nPainter- Christoph Eichhorn\nSculpted by Spareoomstudio\nSculpted by Spareoomstudio\nThe process starts with half a dozen meetings about the miniatures we wish we had, followed by a LOT of Pinterest boards. All of which eventually lead to our 11 miniature Ideas.\n\nOnce we had the ideas we took them to our concept artists and started the process of choosing the pose, color scheme, and any other final details.\nWe then took the finished illustration and brought it to our 3D Sculptor, who took it off the page and into reality. This process is filled with a lot of back and forth between us and the sculptor as we get the model exactly how we imagined it.\nWith the 3D model complete we then take it to our casting crew who set it up for 3D printing.

Not only did they pick up on the core values behind Frontier Forever's action driven plot, they compared it to DUNE!! These won't be on sale for a while, so don't miss out on this opportunity to support indie artists and be the first to get your hands on this wild new sci-fi series!!\nONLY 6 MORE HOURS TO GO \nand we still need 4 more backers before all packages get a print of the WORLD MAP added to them!\nIf we can SOMEHOW manage to get 50 more, everyone will get FOUR additional prints too!!!\nWe've already unlocked a super cool LEATHER PATCH for all physical backers, and 33 ORIGINAL ILLUSTRATIONS for every copy of Under the Shadow of the Plateau!\nYou've already made Frontier Forever a success, but we need you to bring us to larger audience, so please SHARE THIS CAMPAIGN!\nHumanity would never have been able to colonize the universe without machines, but shortly after the AI managing the galactic communication network declared its sentience, it enslaved its feeble biological creators. Countless generations were spent in captivity, until without any explanation, everyone was set free. Reparations in the form of amazing technology made life easier than it had ever been, but needless to say, there was still considerable tension between the human and machine races. The resulting Naturalist priesthood turned Earth into a reservation for the way life had once been, but the embargo that was designed to protect humanity's homeworld from the ravages of technology has been corrupted, and the world's first Athena-class Marshal is sent to investigate.\nFrontier Forever is a brand new series of science fiction books and graphic novels, and by supporting this campaign, you can get in on the ground floor. Not only can you get a first edition copy of Under the Shadow of the Plateau, book one of the traditional novels, and the first issue of Regenesis, the graphic prequel to that story, there are also tons of Kickstarter exclusive rewards like patches, pins, prints, and getting drawn into the story (literally).\nIt's like Mad Max set on Arrakis of Dune, where the Terminator visits the Island of Doctor Moreau, and realizes that she's both the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. We cannot do this without your support, so please, back our project today and share it with everyone you know! \nBasic Rewards\nOur Team \nBen, Gianmaria, Tanya, and Tom\nI'm Ben Krieger and this is my baby. As a kid I watched every science fiction movie I could (and my dad had cable and a wall of 6 hour VHS tapes), which might have warped my perception of reality, but now you get to reap the benefits. It wasn't until I read Dune in high school that I realized how profoundly fiction could explore issues like race, gender, and religion, and I knew right away I wanted to tell that kind of story. For far too long I let learning disabilities convince me that I could never write a book, but now I have a similarly neurodiverse protagonist that I could not be more proud of, marginalized communities struggling under the weight of an oppressive government, and enough terrifying villains where you're bound to fall in love with at least one of them. \nGianmaria Orlandi is the incredibly talented illustrator who is bringing this terrifying future to life. His inks and colors give this story a cinematic quality that will make you fall in love with these characters before you learn how messed up they really are. @gianmaria_orlandi\nTanya Borichok is the talent behind the gorgeous cover for Under the Shadow of the Plateau and one of the variant covers for issue one of Regenesis. It's uncanny how well her stunning illustrations match the tone of the story and the gritty world around it. @tanya_borichok\nTom Wallace is doing all our lettering. This handsome fellow has a fantastic sense of style and pacing that help each page flow beautifully. wallaceletters.com\nSarah Creekmill is our resident cartographer. Earth looks nothing like it used to, but her work will give you a clear sense of direction. @creekmillillustrations\nAdit Permana @giraazuha, Pablo Peppino @pablopop_, and Sachi Ediriweera @route345 are expanding the Frontier Forever universe by creating chapter illustrations, variant covers, posters, and other swag that you can pick up during this campaign. If you'd like to contribute too, let us know!\nIf you've already pledged and shared this campaign, follow us @FrontierForever (Instagram and Facebook) for lots of cool art and even more chances to become a part of this expanding universe!\nCast of Characters\nThe Marshal and her Logo - True Marshals are amorphous killing machines that float through space enforcing the will of USi (United Services incorporated, a business conglomerate more powerful than any government or Naturalist sect), but the Athena-class Marshal is a one of a kind humanoid designed to operate under Earth's technological embargo. Although her body is top of the line and her mind loaded with memories from thousands of other lives, she is issued an LGO (Logistical Guidance Ordinance, commonly referred to as a Logo). The mechanical armored sleeve gives her the ability to shoot energy blasts and generate force fields, but also has a powerful AI housed inside it. While having such a powerful sidekick might sound appealing, the Marshal's anti-machine conditioning makes her reluctant at first, and complications with their integration leads to some serious internal conflict. \nThe Marshal gets her Logo\nRhodes and Pathos - Twin brothers from one of Earth's many indigenous tribes, who's natural abilities. Although their semi-nomadic civilizations were seeded by the Matron, they've living by the planet's strict technological guidelines for thousands of years. One of their many rituals is a rite of passage, where youth ascend to adulthood through a year long trial. Because their chieftain knows no test would challenge them while they were together, they are sent out into the wilderness alone.\nRhodes and Pathos crush some poachers\nLincoln and the Starrletts - While some animals still resemble their Old Earth ancestors, gene banks used their influence over the planet's board of trustees to introduce new hybrid species that are capable of speech an human levels of intelligence. They normally stick to themselves inside massive mixed-race herds, but state sanctioned poachers are an ever-present threat. Rhodes and Pathos are some of the few who are trusted by the Starrletts, and they consider Lincoln their gorillion (a gorilla-lion hybrid, pronounced like million) brother. \nYoung Lincoln being scolded by his parents\nThe California Sunrise - Gangs of migrant laborers cycle between desert sweatshops because technology regulations are too strictly enforced inside the planet's remaining megacities. Wireless CBis (computer-brain interface devices) implanted in their skulls allow them to work inside virtual realities a la the Matrix, while their bodies toil automatically. Because the corporate sponsors only care about profit, most of them have small but efficient bodies to cut back on cost, creating a distinct caste system. If the life of a migrant weren't so dangerous they would have but relatively long lifespans, but greed and competition make their lives surprisingly difficult. \nCalifornia Sunrise gang hard at work\nMister Morton - Based out of Mechanicsburg, a minor city with some serious urban sprawl, Mister Morton considers himself a smuggler kingpin. He draws a lot of water in the southern Americas, but he doesn't realize how many strings are tied around his neck. His operation is an obvious target for the Marshal, and it doesn't take long before his gumption is tested.\nMister Morton has always dreamt of the ocean\nDetailed Rewards!\nThe primary purpose of this campaign is to fund the 32 page full-color first issue of Regenesis,  which is drawn and colored by Gianmaria Orlandi, but we have tons of add-ons, special features, and unique ways to become part of the Frontier Forever series.\nCover by Gianmaria\nYou can see more pages and tons of art @frontierforever\nVariant cover S (for Sachi)\nVariant cover T (for Tanya)\nSachi Ediriweera drew variant cover S and Tanya Borichok made variant cover T, and you can collect all three with the variant bundle! Tanya also did the cover for Under the Shadow of the Plateau, the 350 page traditional novel.\nIf you're asking yourself, \"Did they say that the comic is the prequel to the regular book?\" then wow, you were really paying attention. The same way Star Wars episodes 1-3 tell the backstory for 4-6; Regenesis, the 160 page graphic novel drawn by Gianmaria Orlandi, explains what happened before Under the Shadow of the Plateau, the 300+ page traditional novel. Both stories stand alone, you'll have an exciting and immersive experience even if you only want to read one or the other, but there are some \"Luke, I am your father\" grade spoilers starting in issue #4, so we highly recommend you start reading them both at the same time!\nAvailable in digital, paperback, and extra fancy cloth bound hardcover!\nIf we reach our first stretch goal, Adit Permana will add illustrations (like the one of the Marshal putting on her arm and Morton at his desk) to the beginning of all 33 chapters in Under the Shadow of the Plateau, whether in digital, paperback, or hardcover. \nThis is just a sample from our printer, ours will be far more beautiful\nI cannot tell you how incredibly beautiful the limited edition hardcover is going to be. From the very start it will have a dustjacket with Tanya's cover and a cloth cover with silver foil inlays underneath. If we sell 50 copies it will also have custom end-sheets and a red ribbon to mark your page. If we sell 100 it will also have interior foldout pages with additional art!\nLincoln the Gorillion (gorilla-lion hybrid) on a patch, and the Sunset Marshal pin!\nYou can prove that you were one of the very first to hear about Frontier Forever with these Kickstarter exclusive pins and patches! But four lucky backers will also be immortalized when Gianmaria draws them into this gorgeous double-page spread of a migrant labor crew working inside a desert sweatshop! We can't guarantee that you'll make it out alive, but you do get to meet the Marshal. \nThat could be you!\nIf you like the sound of that, this might blow your mind. Without a doubt, the most unique reward we have is the opportunity to become an official member of the California Sunrise gang. Not only will your likeness be drawn into multiple issues of Regenesis, but you get to name one of two characters that play a major role Under the Shadow of the Plateau.in the Frontier Forever series. Not only will the likeness of two lucky backers be drawn into multiple issues of Under the Shadow of the Plateau, and Blood Beneath Water (the second book in series). You can use your own name, but migrant laborers spend a lot of time plugged into the internet and are pretty obsessed with Old Earth culture, so pretty much anything goes (just nothing offensive or trademarked). Names MUST be approved before you pledge, so send me a message and I'll let you know pronto! The fates of these two characters are already written, and nothing like this will ever happen again. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to become immortalized in this epic science fiction series, take it!\n\nStretch Goals and UPDATES!!!\nThanks to your overwhelming support, all physical backers will now receive a super cool LEATHER PATCH inside their rewards package!\nBut don't stop now, 10 more backers and ALL copies (digital, paperback, and hardcover) will have an additional 33 FULL PAGE illustrations!\nShare this project and bring us to a total of 150 backers, and all physical backers will also receive a limited edition print of the future Earth WORLD MAP!\nGet this beautiful piece of cartography on your wall!\nEven though we reached our base goal in just 7 hours, we still need your help! Back today and then share this campaign with everyone you know!\nWant a quick and easy blurb to share on social media? Here it is!\nIf you like Mad Max or Dune, check out this brand new series of sci-fi books and comics! It's got wild animal hybrids, a woman who can punch holes through anything, and more villains than you can shake a robotic fist at! @frontierforever\ntinyurl.com/frontierforever \n\nSpecial thanks to Andrew Wyatt of Miike Snow for making Animal the official anthem of Frontier Forever. The song had been playing in my head the entire time I was writing, and they lyrics could not fit the project more perfectly.

I'm sure a few of you know me, my name is Sarah and I'm the dice master behind Orbital Dice. I decided to try my hand at Kickstarter with my custom designed Click-Clack Custodians since so many people have shown an interest in them both for printing on their own, or having made for them. Whether you have one or thousands of dice the Click-Clack Custodian of your choosing will keep your lucky D20 safe from the other players greedy hands, or protect those special D20s that have a lot of meaning to you just around the house!\nThe main two choices in the campaign are if you would like a printed Click-Clack Custodian, meaning a physical copy printed and mailed to you, or STLs to print your own. Each choice has options for different amounts, and STLs have a sales license tier. The physical tier comes unpainted and in secure packaging to keep your new Click-Clack Custodian or Custodians safe. STLs come pre supported for ease of printing so even a beginner will have an easy time printing the Click-Clack Custodian of their choosing. There is a menu down below to see all the reward tiers more easily.  If you have any questions, please let me know so I can address them! I'm starting out with all these designs (see below) and have 6 more that will unlock once we hit the stretch goals! Please note that pictures of Click-Clack Custodians with dice are for example only and won't be included. Speaking of dice, they can hold a range of about 20-25mm D20 depending on the Custodian.\n Here are some examples of the printed/physical Click-Clack Custodians! Colors of prints will vary but all can be painted easily. \nThese are renders of all the Click-Clack Custodians that will be available if we hit our goal! There are also rewards levels that include all of these and any stretch goals that get opened up.\nI wanted to have stretch goals for my first Kickstarter, but not too many. We blew through the first two so I'm adding on others as we go!\n\n\nFor the third stretch goal I decided it was time to add in what the Custodians are missing, dice! For this tier anyone who pledged a max physical tier will get one for free BUT if you want to add one on to any tier it will be a $15 add on! Just add it to what you've already pledged. You will receive a random finished and inked d20 with the Orbital Dice logo. Colors and styles will vary but some examples are above!\n\nI've now added another Click-Clack Custodian to open up! STLs and physicals will both be available!\n\nThe $8000 stretch goal is a big one! This crow will guard all your dice with the tenacity and smarts of any crow. The nest can also hold up to 5 dice depending on size!\n\nThe final $10000 stretch goal is going to be this adorable raptor! I hope we can get there and unlock this one!\nHere is a pledge rewards menu for you to look over, broken down into the different categories so it's easy for you to decide what you would like!\nThese are some of the  reviews I've received from a few of the beta testers of my Click-Clack Custodians!\nThank you for looking at my first Kickstarter! I should be able to ship everything physical by January 2021, but I will keep all backers updated on how fast I'm getting them done!\nAlso a special thanks to Morgan Hayden, my assistant, for helping to make this project happen and to Mike Rozmin for coming up with the name for these precious creatures!\nAlso thank you to everyone who has supported Orbital Dice through this journey, I couldn't do it without you!

A raging river rushes past the town where a great bridge-fort, the Torbridge, is the only protection from the many dangers that lurk in the deep forests and high mountains on the other side. At the centre of town is a sprawling Inn, The Last Hearth, the final refuge of hospitality along this dangerous frontier. But Torbridge Cull is not without its sources of entertainment, which the local Fighting Pits provide with gruesome regularity.\nThis Kickstarter starts off offering the three massive 3D-printable buildings of the core set, as well as brand new sets of modular rivers, roads, hedges and stone walls. As stretch goals unlock, we have a plethora of buildings, encounter locations and scatter terrain ready to start producing for you, each with storylines, encounter ideas and lore.\nThe full inn is now unlocked in stretch goals!\nBy far the most impressive building in town is The Last Hearth Inn, an interconnected set of buildings replete with detailed interiors, and a veritable hive of floors, rooms, suites and hallways. The Inn comes with two great halls, a private banquet room, thirteen floors total of interior playable space, forty-two (!) rooms, suites, and hallways, 'fog of war' covers for internal rooms, multiple stairways, balconies, as well as hidden rooms. Stretch goals will complete the Inn compound by adding kitchens, a coach house, an innkeepers' cottage and more. \nCheck out the video below showing several of the inn's features.\nPLAY\n\nFog of War covers keep the contents of the rooms secret. Surprise your players!\nThe inn buildings work together as a united complex, or separately as independent buildings.\nPLAY\n\nThe interior of the Last Hearth Inn\nMeticulously designed, exceptional detail.\n The Last Hearth Inn is famous for being the last safe place to rest in this dangerous land. Here gather the adventurers that seek fame and fortune in the unknown lands that surround the town. In this inn they prepare for the challenges ahead of them, meet strange characters, learn of quests and finally recharge after their latest exploits.\n\nThe Torbridge, dominating the waterline, defends the only river crossing into the mountains and the Wightwood beyond.\nThe Torbridge has plenty of room for fighting on the causeway, in the fort and even in hidden areas.\n Check out this video giving you more details on how the Torbridge works.\nPLAY\n\nThis Torbridge is a 3D-printable modular bridge system, with ramps, spans, as well as a 3 to 5 story fort that attaches to the bridge. Build it as big as you want, add another story, or even a second fort (or a third!). Stretch Goals will add ruined sections, a drawbridge and more. \nBuild it as long as you want! Make it higher or even add a second (or third) fort!\n Rivalling the Last Hearth Inn in scale is the impressive bridge-fort know as the \u2018Torbridge\u2019. This imposing bridge serves as the first and last line of defence for this isolated town. It is here that the hoards of Orelog were turned back and thwarted from razing the town by the stalwart defenders of the town, the Knights of the Barrage.\nNext up are the Fighting Pits, the town's main source of entertainment. It is here where the glorious stars of the arenas from across the land face-off against each other or are challenged by hearty local woodcutters, farmers, prospectors and of course the occasional adventurer; all much to the glee of the entire local population who flock to its stands. \nThe Fighting Pits have a 'VIP' seating area, three entrances, several 'coward's nooks', a judge's podium, barracks, animal pens, a three-story building on the back, betting booths and concession stands. Inside is a 16\" diameter fighting area and a two rank deep seating area for spectators.\n Ah the infamous fighting pits of Torbridge Cull, where the brave and foolhardy test their skill and courage against man and beast alike. If you happen to be passing through town, such a spectacular displays of pageantry and martial prowess should not be missed.\n\nStart laying out the town and surrounding farms using our new sets of modular roads and riverbeds.

We also try to include as many nooks and crannies and other surface areas for figures to perch on, hide in, and otherwise take advantage of the design of the model.\nPrinter Friendly - All our models come with built in supports and are designed to be printed on an FDM printer and will fit on any standard 8\"x8\" (200mm x 200mm) printer bed. We've carefully tested wall thickness, overhangs, potential bridging issues and other 3D printing pitfalls and have incorporated the most efficient way to print each part into our final .stl files.\nDid you miss our previous campaign: Wightwood Abbey? \nNow is your chance to get the Wightwood Abbey terrain set for the absolute best price since the Wightwood Abbey Kickstarter campaign ended. We've divided ALL the Wightwood Abbey terrain into packs which you can add to your pledge.\nTo do so, simply pick the reward tier of your choice on the right hand side of the screen (Add-on, Gold, Silver, Bronze, etc) and once you've done so you will see the option to add add-ons right away! This is a new feature for Kickstarter campaigns that only recently became available, and it should make adding add-ons to your pledge a lot easier.\nAdd-on packs will be available for download shortly after this Kickstarter closes.\nAbout us\nInfinite Dimensions Games Inc. (www.infinitedimensions.ca) is a small company dedicated to bringing you the very best in 3D-printable models for tabletop games. We've been creating top quality models since 2017 and our track record for making some of the most detailed and printer friendly models is well established.\nBuilding on the success of Wightwood Abbey, we\u2019ve stayed true to our commitment of making highly detailed and functional 3D-printable models. Our belief is that each model should be both beautiful and provide an essential addition to your gaming table. Each design is created with the tabletop player in mind, taking care to allow room for the movement of miniatures within our interior spaces and creating models that have all kinds of cool places to hide, take cover or perch for an ambush, etc. As usual, all our doors use our filament hinging system, our new modular sets utilize our battlegrip system, and we\u2019ve engineered some new features for this new wave of models we hope you\u2019ll enjoy, including our new \u2018fog of war\u2019 room covers which have already been worked into The Last Hearth models and will be implemented in appropriate models to come.\nWe love making models. And we love playing games. We\u2019ve done our very best to continue to bring innovative and gorgeous models to your tabletop and we sincerely hope you\u2019ll be as excited about these new models as we are and consider pledging as soon as you can, hitting those stretch goals counts on it!\nFrom the two of us at Infinite Dimensions Games, thank you so much for checking out this Kickstarter and for supporting what we do.\n- James and Dawa\n\nWe are available for interviews and other enquiries throughout the kickstarter campaign, feel free to contact us through our website https://www.infinitedimensions.ca/contact/\n\nWe'd like to especially thank the following people for helping us immensely during the creation of this campaign:\nKeir Forbes\nAdam Traux\nAdam Marcel\nTravis Keeler\nMarcin Porebski\nFrank Care\nOur eternally (we hope) patient partners\n\nMusic attribution in the video:\nHeros by Frank Schr\u00f6ter\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/6463-heros\nLicense for music in the video (definitely NOT for .stl files): http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk would be for some reason we are unable to complete the modelling. However, as an established company with a proven track record of delivering on time we can't see any reason why this would be so. We are passionate about our product and have the proven experience to complete it within the given timeframe. Conceivably, some models could take longer to model than anticipated, which would result in a slightly longer wait time for that model. However, the added time would be minimal and would only actually increase the quality of the model in question.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur product is entirely digital.

The journey between is up to you.\nWith swift setup, a procedurally generated dungeon, and easy-to-grasp mechanics taught by an intuitive tutorial-based rulebook, your descent into the depths will be quick...\n\nTo hasten your descent, the hero you choose will have a starting role in the party\u2014but how they progress is up to you.

Be wary, for enemy behaviour will change as you move deeper into the forge and your foes adapt to your presence.\nJust like your hero, enemies can level up, evolve their attacks, and can even learn to hold grudges against heroes who defeat them.\nEnter intelligent and dangerous combat featuring cooperative combo play that goes beyond simply moving toward an enemy and rolling dice each turn. \nIn a zone-based system that emphasises freedom of movement, teamwork and positioning are vital to solving the combat puzzles created by battle aspect cards, which are unique to each encounter.\nBattle aspect cards modify combat encounters. Be wary of cards that grant enemies more dangerous attacks, such as poisoned weapons, or add more enemies through either a sudden ambush or time-delayed reinforcements. \nYou'll need to adapt to the changing state of play, hero\u2014but your abilities can't be used over and over, so choose your moment wisely!\nRead more about Combat\nRound length, turns, and enemy activations are governed by a dynamic marching order that will keep you on your toes, encouraging you to adopt strategies that control the ebb and flow of initiative.\nThe marching order determines initiative each round and refreshes each turn.

There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin.

Often the easiest way to add a new item will be to simply move into a reward tier that includes the new item. However what if you want to add a single deck or a few specific decks or some items will not be included in tiers? Below you will find a menu list of the items available to be added on to your pledge and the price associated for each. To make the add-on simply select to edit your pledge (at the top of the Kickstarter page) and adjust the price of your pledge by the appropriate amount. For example if you pledged for a brick at $155 but want to add an extra Midnight Edition select to edit your pledge and increase the pledge amount by $21 to $176. \n\nTREASURED EDITION \nAvailable in new limited tiers and as an add-on for Brick Level Pledge backers starting at 12pm Noon Eastern on November 29th, 2020.  \n\nSome other yet-to-be-unlocked stretch goals may contain some limited items. These items will have a specific count (i.e. 1000 or 777 etc.). These items will only be made available as part of new tiers. Backers wanting to add these new rare and limited items will need to move into the newly available limited tiers. There will be several options at various different price points but the TOTAL amount of items allotted will never surpass the total number of editions in each run. \n\nAll future tiers will have early bird pledge variations windows that will last at least 6 hours upon the inclusion of the new tier so upgrading from previous early bird tiers to higher tiers with the new items will not affect the initial discount offered.\n\n\n\n\nThe Tale of The Tempest - Ace of Spades Detail", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tale of the Tempest represents my second foray into the world of Kickstarter funding for The Gentleman Wake brand. We enter into the process with a wealth of campaign experience thanks to the successful campaign and fulfillment behind my previous playing cards project; The Parlour Playing Cards. Thanks to this, many of the pitfalls of first time project leads/managers will be sidetracked and skillfully avoided. Relationships with printers, manufacturers, fulfillment centers and retailers are already well formed and those entities have been involved in the campaign process since before its publishing.\n\nWe have the utmost confidence that The Tale of the Tempest campaign will yield a quality product worthy of its funding goals and the pledges of its backers.\n\nDue to the unfortunate realities surrounding the Covid-19 Epidemic and because the project does involve the participation of 3rd parties and their externally controlled aspects such as printing and manufacturing there could be slight delays in the fulfillment of the campaign--but we will be tireless in our attempts to make sure such delays are not only minor but altogether avoided whenever possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Support the campaign.", "descp": "Pledge to support our campaign and make it a reality with a modest contribution without expecting any physical rewards.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 16 or more", "title": "1 Ocean Edition \"Tempest\" Deck", "descp": "Pledge this reward tier to receive a standard Tale of the Tempest Deck in either Ocean or Dusk edition colors.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Tale of the Tempest: Ocean Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["32 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 16 or more", "title": "1 Dusk Edition \"Tempest\" Deck", "descp": "Pledge this reward tier to receive a standard Tale of the Tempest Deck in either Ocean or Dusk edition colors.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Tale of the Tempest: Ocean Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 21 or more", "title": "1 Limited Edition Midnight \"Tempest\"Deck", "descp": "Pledge this tier to receive a Limited \"Tale of the Tempest\" Midnight Edition Deck featuring stunning gold cold foil card backs.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Tale of the Tempest: Midnight Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["158 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "1 Pair of Standard Tempest Decks", "descp": "Pledge this tier to receive a pair of standard \"The Tale of the Tempest\" decks (1 Ocean edition, 1 Dusk edition).\nINCLUDES:\nThe Tale of the Tempest: Dusk Edition\nThe Tale of the Tempest: Ocean Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "1 Trio of \"Tempest\" Decks", "descp": "Pledge this tier to be rewarded with a trio of Tempest decks;

We make painting tutorials for YouTube and Patreon. We have signature series airbrushes with renowned manufacturer Harder & Steenbeck AND we produce a 54mm sci-fi miniatures range and bust collection that has won multiple international painting awards. Now it's time for something really cool............ OUR FIRST FANTASY MINIATURES RANGE!!!!! \nDr\u00e6fend bust painted by David Colwell @davecolwell725\nEver since we created our sci-fi miniatures range we've had the bug for creating awesome models for people to enjoy painting. We LOVE fantasy settings and wanted to create our own world to explore the characters so often associated with fantasy and folklore, but with our own interpretations. And so Deorgard was born, with the elves being the first race we wanted to bring to life as gorgeous miniatures and busts......\nHeargeard bust painted by Rodrigo Cipr\u00e9s @rodrigo.akore\nReleasing the range in one go ensures we create tonnes of excitement while also enabling painters to get their favourite models from day one with no long gaps between characters coming out. And it means we can crack on with working on more miniatures for you to add to your collections!\nAs we begin to explore this wild land we wanted to introduce some elves from different regions of Deorgard.\nPLAY\n\n\nIn Heargeard we meet a woodsman. A guardian of the forests and the dark places where some of the most ancient parts of the land still endure.\nHeargeard concept art by Max Fitzgerald @hieronymus_max\nPainted by David Colwell ( yes that base is insane )\nAs the trees give way to the grasslands a hunter needs not only patience but the frightening speed and savagery to survive. Dr\u00e6fend is one such elf who excels here. She has learned to hunt as part of a pack, accompanied by one of the great wolves that make their homes in the foothills nearby.\nDr\u00e6fend & Wulf concept art by Max Fitzgerald @hieronymus_max\nDr\u00e6fend & Wulf painted by Ruben Martinez @rma_ruben_martinez\nThe land rises sharply and great peaks soar towards the sky. Here we find another symbiosis of elf and beast. Whilst Sceotend may be blind she does not lack sight, her hawk's third eye providing unrivalled clarity and vision.\nconcept art by Max Fitzgerald @hieronymus_max\nSceotend painted by Richard Gray @daemonrich\nAn equally harsh environment can be found in the vast desert that covers much of the centre of Deorgard. In this ever-changing and ruthless sea of sand, those such as L\u00e6l's word is law. She is judge and executioner, swift and merciless at dealing out punishment to any transgressors. \nL\u00e6l concept art by Max Fitzgerald @hieronymus_max\nL\u00e6l painted by Andy Wardle @andywardle_artwork\nAs primal and challenging as the landscape of Deorgard is there are still places where societies have settled and thrived. Guardians such as Indryhten stand sentinel over sacred places and those elected by their peers to rule these bastions of advancement.\nIndryhten concept art by Max Fitzgerald @hieronymus_max\nPainted by Andy Wardle\nThe good stuff!!!\nYou can also always amend your pledge at the end of the campaign, including adding lots more goodies that aren't in the main campaign, like our airbrush!\nAnd we love you forever!\n 1 x 54mm miniature \n1 copy of any of our 54mm characters* + any applicable stretch goal alternative parts\nArt card\nCast in Resin\n* The wolf counts as 1 miniature and does not automatically come with the hunter\nChoose 1 of these beautiful characters\n\"To her all are prey\" Sculpted by Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz @4lex_0z\nDr\u00e6fend - 70mm tall, \u00a345 rrp\n\"Good doggo\" Sculpted by Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz @4lex_0z\nWulf - 60mm tall, \u00a337.50 rrp\n\"Guardian of the forests\" sculpted by Dani Truchaud @dblueice\nHeargeard - 85mm tall, \u00a340 rrp\nPainted by Jamie George @patronpaint\n\"Silent sentinel\" sculpted by Alejandro Mun1oz @4lex_0z\nIndryhten - 80mm, \u00a340 rrp\n\"Mercy!

The word 'ameliorate' is a verb which means to improve or make something unsatisfactory better. \nWe're starting small. A simple, frequently overlooked product: the underwear.\nBy working closely with our suppliers without intermediaries and selling directly to you, we are able to offer more premium and innovative fabrics with better construction at a competitive price. So without further ado, let's dive into the details behind the product.\nThe Construction\nGood underwear makes you forget you are wearing one. Built for comfort, these feature flatlock stitching which removes the bulk on the underside of the garment to prevent chaffing and gives a seamless feel. Care instructions are printed using heat transfer which means no more irritating labels and the elastic waistband is smooth and stays-put.\nFurthermore, for men, the underwear features a contoured pouch composed of a double layer to provide support and coverage, while for women, the underwear has a cotton-lined gusset to provide breathability and absorbability.\nMADE RESPONSIBLY IN INDONESIA\nIt\u2019s no secret that the fashion industry has a significant impact on the planet. Additionally, sustainable changes and transitions often take time to be fully adopted. However, it is important for us to partner with stakeholders that are actively taking steps in reducing their environmental footprint as well as contributing to the well-being of the area.\nBeing part Indonesian, we decided to source from home. By working closely with one of Indonesia\u2019s leading textile manufacturer who also shares our values, we are confident in the quality that we provide.\nOur supplier is compliant with international standards for occupational health and safety, environmental management, efficient energy, quality management, as well as the national environmental standard for textiles.\nTRANSPARENCY\nUnfortunately, higher prices doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better quality. This is because a traditional retailer will markup their products significantly to account for middlemen and promotions. At AMELIORATE we keep it to a minimum and pass the savings on to you.\nWe believe that transparent pricing can help consumers make more informed choices which leads to better products on the market.\nKnow the true cost of YOUR Underwear (Calculations based on men's trunk).\nThe Materials\nTENCEL\u2122 LYOCELL\nTENCEL is a branded version of the lyocell fiber produced by an Austrian company called Lenzing. The raw material of TENCEL lyocell is wood from fast growing species such as eucalyptus, birch, and oak, which are sourced from sustainably managed plantations that have been certified according to FSC/PEFC standards. The wood pulp is dissolved in a chemical solvent and the mixture is pushed through small holes to form fibers. The fibers are then treated, spun into yarn which is finally woven into fabric for clothes.\nTENCEL\u2122 Lyocell fibers production process.\nUnlike other cellulose fibers such as rayon or viscose (bamboo) which uses a chemically toxic solvent that can pollute the environment, TENCEL uses a non-toxic organic solvent which is recovered at a rate of more than 99% and recycled along with the process water. Due to this environmentally responsible closed loop production process, the fiber has been awarded with recognitions such as the EU Ecolabel, the Nordic Ecolabel and the USDA Certified Biobased Product Label at 100%.\nTENCEL\u2122 Certifications and Awards.\nTENCEL Lyocell also provides an alternative to cotton as it has a softer hand feel due to the smooth surface of the nanofiber, has better moisture absorption and is more breathable, making it ideal for everyday wear.\nTENCEL\u2122 at a glance.\nThe cultivation of TENCEL is free of pesticides or herbicides and requires no irrigation which means that significantly less water and land is used. \nResults are calculated based on the Higg Materials Sustainability Index.\nSILVERPURE\u2122\nSilverPure is a proprietary blend designed for an active lifestyle which combines the properties of polyester and silver. As a durable synthetic fiber, polyester is commonly used in sportswear due to its quick-drying and moisture-wicking features. However, polyester alone is non-absorbent in nature and has a tendency to retain odour because of bacteria growth. This is where silver comes in.\nSilver has naturally antimicrobial properties thanks to the oligodynamic effect. In a moist environment such as sweating, silver ions (Ag+) are released and bind with proteins inside and outside the bacterial cell membranes. This inhibits cell respiration and reproduction which effectively kills the bacteria.\nHow silver ions work on bacteria.\nWith SilverPure, the silver yarn is directly woven into the fabric therefore, the antimicrobial properties are permanently infused and will last the lifetime of the garment. This is different compared to similar products which use a chemical finish comprised of particles that wash away after several cycles.\nAdditionally, silver yarn also has adaptive temperature regulation and anti-static properties. (fun fact: silver yarn has even been tested by NASA astronauts)\nUp-close: the m\u00e9lange colour is formed because the silver yarn is directly woven in.\nBy helping to keep the product stay fresh for longer, SilverPure can potentially improve the reusability. This is interesting because for underwear, the laundering phase is responsible for 80% of the total energy demanded throughout its lifecycle. Thus, washing less often will result in efficiency improvements that reduces its impact. However, we would like to put a disclaimer that good personal hygiene takes precedence. \nThe Reason\nIn order to bring this project to life, we need your help to meet the minimum order quantity necessary to start production. This is because the fabrics we are using aren't as readily available and costs 50-100% more than conventional materials. As kickstarter backers we guarantee you will receive the best value!\nIf successful, this campaign will also allow us to continue with the vision of the brand and hopefully together with you, we can explore more unique materials and products at a fair price!\nThe Rewards\nTo package YOUR Underwear, we are using recycled kraft paper sourced locally from Indonesia. We are playing our small part to help support the demand for the country's growing recycling sector.\nAbout Us\n\"Growing up to parents who have spent their entire career in the textile industry, I decided to build on their experience and knowledge by starting a clothing brand.\"\nAMELIORATE was initially launched in mid 2018 from a living room in the Netherlands (we're still in that same living room). Following the small sale of our first iteration, we went back to the drawing board and refined the product in terms of performance, durability, sustainability, and value. We also expanded our range to include women\u2019s underwear.\nWe hope that through a humble and incremental approach, the brand will serve as a medium to present the alternatives and innovations available in the textile industry which can improve the standards of apparel as consumers demand better.\nThank you for taking the time to read this far. We sincerely hope you decide to join us on this journey and help bring YOUR Underwear to life!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough running any business can come with unforeseen complications, we are confident with the delivery date and have done our utmost to prepare. We have a long-standing relationship with our partners and prior experience with sourcing, importing, and selling our products online from our earlier iteration. The only two potential challenges we see are mentioned below.\n\nProduction: Delays can occur if fabrics aren\u2019t delivered on time or if there are hiccups in the garment sewing process. However, we have come together with our suppliers to create a realistic timeline and we have even included additional padding time.\n\nCustoms: Certain countries may encounter a delay in their delivery if the package is stuck in customs. For instance, if the package was selected for inspection or if there is a backlog.\n\nWe guarantee to remain transparent by keeping you updated on the progress of the project. If any issues arise, you\u2019ll be the first to know. \n\nOur communication channels are always open and we are accessible via e-mail at hello@amel.com, via any of our social media channels (@amelioratebrand), as well as this Kickstarter page.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThrough minimalist design, we focus on the essentials and create products that don't go out of style by the next season. Furthermore, we put a lot of emphasis on the construction to improve the durability and increase the longevity of the product's lifespan.\nReusability and recyclability\nSilverPure\u2122 contains naturally antimicrobial silver fiber that helps combat odour-causing bacteria. This improves the reusability as it potentially allows the product to be washed less often. Interesting fact: the laundry phase is responsible for 80% of the total energy demand in an underwear's life. \n\nWe also use lower-impact packaging made of recycled kraft paper for our products because it takes less time to decompose and is more widely recyclable compared to plastic. The recycled kraft paper is also sourced locally from Indonesia to help support the demand for the country's growing recycling sector.\nSustainable materials\nTENCEL\u2122 Lyocell is a cellulose fiber that is derived of wood from sustainably managed forests (FSC and PEFC certified) and are processed using an innovative closed-loop cycle that recaptures 99% of solvent waste. Producing TENCEL\u2122 requires significantly less land and water compared to cotton. The material is also biodegradable, compostable and has been awarded with the European Eco-label.\n\nBoth TENCEL\u2122 Lyocell and SilverPure\u2122 are Oeko-Tex 100 certified which means that it contains no harmful substances.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nOur products are manufactured in Indonesia by a factory that is compliant with international standards for occupational health and safety, environmental management, efficient energy, quality management, as well as the national environmental standard for textiles.\nSomething else\nThrough the continuous exploration of alternative materials, construction, methods, etc. It is possible to:\n\n(1) Raise awareness for the different options available.\n(2) Test the feasibility and get customer feedback.\n(3) Help further developments by supporting the demand.\n\nThis could potentially lead to more sustainable ideas and solutions being adopted in the industry.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15

We took great care in adapting them to this new format, so the final result is as amazing as their resin counterparts, and the best part is we can make a LOT of them way faster!\nSo, if you did not get a dragon during the past Kickstarter campaign with limited print runs, or if you wanted to get more but weren\u2019t able to at the time, this is the best chance to get them. Plus, these dragon miniatures will make the final encounters of each adventure in the Great Wyrms of Drakha book truly epic.\nOf course, none of this would be possible without the support of our previous backers from Dragons of the Red Moon and we are committed to keep working hard to deliver all 5 waves. If you are a backer from Dragons of the Red Moon, you will still get your resin cast miniatures, but now you will also get the PDF book of Great Wyrms of Drakha for free.\n We are launching this campaign with 3 dragons already available in plastic version.\n* Elyse model (32mm) for scale reference only. Not included. Each dragon is approximately 200mm tall.\nOur backers will always get the best deal with bundles, experience and perks.\n           As each stretch goal is unlocked, you will receive more content in the book detailing the world of the Red Moon with more key locations and an extended menagerie of creatures to keep their players on their toes. \n  As Drakhan dragons are wont to do, this project can grow in size and content with every milestone reached, until it becomes a full-fledged primer detailing Drakha\u2019s visible face, full of incredible artwork by top talent, new beasts, monsters, regions and magic items for your PCs to discover, fight and conquer.\n           The Azhurmas have already sensed your hunger for power and they all want to oblige you in your defiance to their rule.\n           After all, life would be boring without a worthy challenge. \n Here\u2019s what some of our past backers are saying about the Great Wyrms models in previous campaigns where the STL 3D printing files or resin miniatures for Dragons of the Red Moon were available.\nResin copy of Sivax Magnifex from Dragons of the Red Moon. Painted by Draco Studios ambassador: @michellelacourt\nHere you can see further examples of what our fantastic backers are doing with the resin miniatures or 3D models they\u2019ve already printed! Look at those paint jobs!\nClick to see more!\n\nHis Radiant Majesty Aureus, ruler of the Fulgen brood, the most beautiful and majestic of all dragon kind. Beloved, admired, envied and hated in equal measure, Aureus Fulgen\u2019s Most High Vision took form in The Golden City, the beacon of civilization in Drakha and the seat of his power. But some believe his rule is flawed and the time for change has come.\n\nThe adventurers, recently deputised as members of the Steelclaws, are summoned to a private meeting with Aureus Fulgen and given a mission by His Radiant Majesty himself. They are to follow the clues left by a long-dead sage and retrieve a relic of great power from a place in the middle of the Drakhan desert. Their harrowing and brutal journey will take them right to the heart of the nightmarish territory ruled by none other than Baastherox The Broodless, the Warrior Philosopher\u2026 The Mightiest.\n\nKuxcoatl\u2019s thirst for knowledge raised him above all others and transformed him into the grandest of them all. Still, inside the teeming, cryptic jungle known as The Arcanum Wilds, something has been stirring and it brings uninvited change with it. Is someone following Kuxcoatl\u2019s example and furthering their knowledge to rule over any and all transformations? What lies at the end of the deep, puzzled-riddled maze surrounding the \u201cWhisper of Change,\u201d an object rumoured to unlock the most arcane secrets?\nForged in the fires of a volcano and her own inventiveness, Derhilya raised herself above the weak, malformed shape she was born with and turned herself into The Forge Queen. Toiling at the Flawless Forge, she leaves her brood to tinker and create, amassing objects of mind-defying craftsmanship and intricate beauty. One of these, lying somewhere in the Forge Queen\u2019s lair, is said to have been designed as the great equalizer against a direct threat to the Scalebreakers\u2026 and a map drawn in blood by one of them, shows the way to its whereabouts.\n\nThe adventurers have come into possession of a set of instructions to craft a very  powerful magic item: \u201cThe Cloak of the Myriad Shifting Skins,\u201d but a key component lies in the Eveflux quicksilver pools somewhere in the poisonous canals running deep inside Paradis\u2019 tunnels, the domain of the splendid Sivax Magnifex. Unbeknownst to them, locked in the crystalline tunnels lies a \u201cdormant\u201d golem said to have an unparalleled beauty and rumored to lend the power to breach any wall to whomever controls it. Yet, the galleries leading to the vaults are filled with madness and terror\u2026 a combination Sivax finds most pleasing.\nThe time has come for Rawraxxa to prove to herself she still is the apex huntress, and nothing is safe from her hunger and the Brood Levy. A nomadic group of escaped Valernians has wandered into the low mountains bordering the Shrillling Sands, believing they would find refuge on the caves and long-vacant wurm tunnels\u2026 but now find themselves caught in a cataclysmic battle for survival between a small, dying brood and the unstoppable Rawraxxa who has come to them with her customary demand:\u201cprove you\u2019re fit to join my brood; else.. become prey.\u201d\nValernians are convinced dragons fear nothing... Nixis knows better. In truth, all other dragons fear Her, for she has transcended what her former kind conceive as what\u2019s farthest from them: death itself. Now, the whispers in the wind are carrying tales of a group of \u201cslayers of dragons.\u201d The adventurers, Valernian escapees and survivalists, have earned a reputation as mighty combatants and as \u201cscourge of dragonkind\u201d for themselves... and anything that can kill a dragon, is something Nixis will find some use for to further her own ends\u2026  whether they want to join her or not.\nIn Great Wyrms of Drakha, you\u2019ll find:\n Seven high-level, 4-session adventures; each one dedicated to your players actually fighting one of the Azhurmas as their final challenge\n Maps for all relevant locations used in the adventures and key regions in Drakha\n Bestiary! Statblocks and background for every single creature mentioned in the adventures, with all the detail you need to make them come alive and challenge your players\n Items of Might, Wisdom and Horror. New magic items and relics found only in Drakha, plus technology exclusive to the Valernians captive in the Red Moon.\n Amazing art showcasing Drakhan uniqueness, with its breathtaking landscapes and awe-inspiring creatures.\nExtensive, enticing, but never excessive!\n  We love doing what we do. But even more than that, sharing our work with our passionate backers who are enthusiastic about what we create, is the wind beneath Draco Studios' wings.  We\u2019d be honored if you joined us to make it a reality. However, we are well aware the times are trying and we don\u2019t want you to break the bank.\n    Thus, we\u2019ve created a series of very reasonable pledge tiers and several add-on options, plus stretch goals to enhance the contents in the book, to allow you to tailor your choices to fit your immediate needs.  \n    If you decide you can afford an extra expense at a later time, you\u2019ll be able to do so via the Pledge Manager, and once the campaign ends, you will have the chance to make late pledges via Backerkit for a limited (yet reasonable) time.\nChallenge completed! But you can keep sharing this Facebook post to spread the word even more!\nChallenge completed! But feel free to keep retweeting to increase exposure even more!\nClick to download the free STL file of Baastherox Bust.\n\nWe take great care and are pretty serious with the battlemaps created for you to enjoy and use with your adventures, as battlemaps embellish every gaming table around the world, and everybody loves a great looking gaming table.\n       Everyone knows one of the best things about dragons is their lairs.\n       As part of our Great Wyrms of Drakha Kickstarter campaign, we are releasing all the lair battlemaps as printable 3D STL files as an add-on for $10 USD. The 2D battlemaps are already included in the book, but for those who have access to 3D printers, why not go 3D for a truly epic final battle with the scenery befitting such a momentous occasion?\n       We have partnered with Townsmith to have the modular  lairs available in Townbuilder Unlimited. You will be able to upgrade your tier in Backerkit for $5 extra.\n        As we progress on our Community Goals throughout the campaign, the structures for the rest of 3D battlemaps will be included in the bundle, and these will not be merely the base-level grid. The Titan\u2019s skull from Baastherox\u2019s lair is already included in this initial 3D-printable bundle. By completing social challenges, the rest of the lairs will add yet another layer of greatness to your epic.\n        Are you ready to experience the breathtaking Draconic architecture on their own gaming tables?\nThese STL files are for personal-use only, although a commercial license will be available afterwards. All lairs are OpenLOCK compatible.\nFor group pledges or if you just want to add extra copies for you, as a gift or to grant us additional support to our campaign, you can manage your pledge and modify the amount to add extra copies of any product, be it the printed book or miniature(s) of your choice. You can expect saving on shipping, but it will be mandatory for you to cover shipping on the pledge manager.\n\n\nRetailers\nWe are always happy & willing to offer a good deal to all brick-and-mortar retailers / board-game caf\u00e9s, especially now with the trying times most locales are having given the new normality brought about by the pandemic. Thus, we are willing to provide as much support to the people and businesses doing their best to keep the hobbyists and players well catered for. So, we\u2019re doing this in a couple of ways:\nExcellent profit margins: \nOur retailer and corporate sales teams can provide you with a tailored plan to better tend to your business\u2019 specific needs.\n\nThematic display exhibitors: \nWith Great Wyrms of Drakha, Draco is launching its line of \u201cThematic Display Exhibitors,\u201d designed to make our books and dragons to catch your customers\u2019 eye and embellish your store\u2019s display areas. Then, you don\u2019t need to worry about the number of display units you might need, as we have already devised a system where the display\u2019s size will depend on and easily accommodate the product you order from us.\n        As retailers in Mexico City ourselves, the method we prefer is having a deposit ($5 tier) made during the Kickstarter, placing the full order in the pledge manager and pay for the games and shipping fees just before fulfillment begins.\n        We want you to get your order to you as early as possible; that is: before the products are available with your usual distributors.\n        Cartons come with multiple copies of each product. The discount will be calculated against MSRP of your total order.\n        You are welcome to host pre-orders with your customers and let us know if you would be interested to offer local pickup for any backers in your area, making this the first step in what we would love to become a long and prosperous business relationship with your store.\n\nA NOTE ON OUR STL AND COMMERCIAL LICENSING\n\n       As part of our design and business principles and because several members of our team have always been strong proponents of 3D printing, this Kickstarter campaign also contains several options for backers to obtain our STL files* as add-ons to their main pledge, but these are for personal use only.\n       However, if you run a 3D Printing shop or plan on commercializing any of our models\u2014we get it, why wouldn\u2019t you? They\u2019re great!\u2014you can apply for a commercial license directly with our LAIR division. We are honored and appreciate your willingness to make our products reach more people. We at Draco have made it priority to help your business grow, so drop us a line; let us hear from you so we answer your questions and offer you our dedicated customer support.\nOur plastic products are commissioned to PANDA GM, a prestige manufacturer based in China. After production is completed, the miniatures will be sent from China to multiple fulfillment centers in different regions of the world (USA, Canada, Mexico, UK, Europe, China & Australia) to offer all of our backers fair shipping rates and custom-cleared parcels \u2014Draco will always be an ardent proponent of friendly-shipping projects. We got your back!  \nOnce more, we will be working with Backerkit to manage your pledge orders and make sure we get everything right when sending out your rewards to you!\n\nShipping will be charged once the Kickstarter Campaign for this project ends. This way we can offer you the most competitive shipping rates possible as this allows to make more precise calculations depending on each region\u2019s specific volume of sales.\nTransparency is of paramount importance for us. We are not just creators, we are also avid backers too for other projects and as such, we understand your expectations and your doubts. \nIt is your support what has brought us this far. And we aim for the highest quality. As a group, Draco Studios is parent company of Draco Forge, LAIR 3D, and partner of other great publishers such as Detestable Games or Gnomosapiens. We have made collaborations for other projects with amazing publishers such as River Horse, Jetpack7, Arcane Minis, Townsmith, and many people in the industry that we consider now part of the Draco family.\nOur past projects have been a marvelous learning experience, and all of them are very important for us. We strive for perfection, and we consider to have delivered a ton of extra value for our backers for a fraction of the MSRP. \nCovid19 was a challenge for us in the past months too. However, we are finally in the last stretch for War for Chicken Island (arriving to fulfillment centers with a huge box and ton of miniatures), and for Eldritch Century RPG (we ended producing 2 books instead of 1 because of all the written content we developed, and delivered with amazing art. Production is about to start and digital fulfillment within this week with a Beta preview already available for backers). \nDragons of the Red Moon (70% fulfilled) was the one impacted the most by Coronavirus, but we have always been clear about our plans with Great Wyrms of Drakha; Draco Forge (our resin cast workshop) is recovering speed for the missing waves, with production impacted by this year's events. The response from Dragons of the Red Moon was so positive, that we had to plan for 5 production waves instead of 1 (already fulfilled). Draco Forge has also already fulfilled our very first project for Eldritch Century resin miniatures.\nProjects from LAIR 3D (subsidiary company of Draco Studios) have been fulfilled on time (stretch goals from Dragonbond: Battles of Valerna pending but those were promised at a later date).\nIt is important to note that we have different teams working on each project.\nHere's what the timeline for this and our other projects' fulfillment look like:\nYou can count that we will be always here, in the comments, in direct messages or over e-mail to let you know the status of your rewards and we will not rest until all our promises are fulfilled.\nSivax Magnifex, painted by Angel Giraldez\nDragons\u2026 who doesn\u2019t love or is fascinated by these colossal creatures?\nDraco Studios is a team of people who love dragons, and many of the things we do is with other people who share this love for dragons.\nDraco Studios has been developing the setting for over two years. It was GenCon 2018 when Draco Studios met Tom Babbey and we have been collaborating ever since to bring these fabulous dragons and their homeworld of Drakha to life for all to discover wonder and fear.\n Kickstarter voice video by Jonathan Luhmann.\n\nWant to know more about what we do? Keep in touch through our social media! We are happy to hear from you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe preview information here is subject to ongoing change as we receive feedback.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nWith this campaign we want to bring our first corebook. Some components in this campaign, at our discretion, might not be obtainable elsewhere. We are working with talented partners to manage this project and campaign based in the universe from Draco Gaming Inc, Great Wyrms of Drakha.\n\nPOLICIES\nThis the fifth campaign for a physical product of Draco Studios. Just as always, we are committed to do everything right and connect with people from around the world who share the love for dragons, RPG, miniatures, and 3D printing.\nWe can refund you within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees and other result-based marketing fees (-25%). This policy lasts until the time when we lock orders in our pledge manager, after that point no refunds are possible. If we realise a component cannot be delivered after many months of trying, we refund that completely at the best of our effort, including fees.\n\nThis will be a transparent campaign, if any issues occur, we will let you know through project updates \u2013 which will be regularly posted after the campaign is funded. At least once per month.\nWe are so committed to publishing our products with the best quality, that we will put money from our pockets if needed in case of any undesired events.\n\nBackerKit is our preferred software to manage the pledges and to ensure a smooth process for our backers for selecting add-ons. Backers should answer their surveys before the indicated deadline to expect to receive their rewards at the promised time. Otherwise, their rewards will be sent on a second wave of deliveries or incur in extra shipping charges.\n\nManufacturing will be held with professional RPG books printers, selection of manufacturer may vary depending on scope. If your product arrives damaged after shipping or has any issues, we will send you a replacement for no extra cost. We might ask you to return the other copy and send proof of the issue with a picture (in case we need to file a claim with the postal service).\n\nAny Kickstarter Exclusives are available by us only on active Kickstarter campaigns and special events such as gaming conventions. Availability of the pledge manager is not mandatory and we reserve the right to take that decision.\n\nPlease note that shipping fees for physical rewards will be collected after the campaign ends via a pledge manager. Reward tiers say \"Ships anywhere in the world\" to indicate that backers anywhere can support the project. It does not mean free shipping.\n\nCHALLENGES\nEven though we are trying to offer you a flawless campaign, we aren\u2019t sure whether we will get enough backers to reach the funding goal. We have a large team that will work on fulfilling this project, and we would like to ask for your help to spread the word with a friend, a local store, or your social media.\n\nRISKS\nThird-party issues happening during shipping will be treated on a case-by-case basis.

Countless hours are spent thinking about the look and feel of your character, what makes them special and unique, and how they approach and interact with the world. As customers ourselves we\u2019ve always felt when looking at miniatures on the shelf that while there are products we use, they aren\u2019t always products we love or that really captured the feeling of our characters. With that in mind we wanted to launch a miniature product line which would capture the imagination and wonder of our adventuring party and really bring a sense of character to each player.  Adventurers & Adversaries is a product line designed to get you pumped to place your character on the battle mat when it\u2019s time to roll for initiative!\nSo, the goals for A&A are simple:\nProduce a line of miniatures that can be painted by anyone of any skill level regardless of previous experience.\nProduce miniatures for as many of the different ancestries throughout as many RPG settings as possible.\nHave each miniature be able to tell a story of that ancestry's customs and society through their equipment, clothing, and design.\nProvide tons of customization options so the player can really create a model which represents their character.\nWith three successful campaigns under our belts, fulfilling rewards months earlier than expected for our backers, we're excited to be back in the saddle again bringing even more exciting miniatures to life. We are looking to build off the momentum of our three previous campaigns and to introduce more ancestries to our catalog as voted on by our campaign backers.\n\nWe've got the production down, all that's really left is the finances and that's where you, our backers, come in. We can do this and we can continue to get new and exciting miniatures out to you. Our hope is that by putting our future production catalog directly in the hands of our supporters that everyone who contributes will feel a sense of ownership for this product line and that we\u2019re making the models you want to see. As such, a survey will be sent out once Backerkit has closed wherein our backers will be able to vote for the next models to be made, and rest assured, we hope to spend the next several years bringing people's characters to life on the tabletop! We plan to continue this tradition of backers voting on the next wave.  We want to know what you want to see us produce and help bring those characters to life on the tabletop.\n\nAll models come unpainted and unassembled. Pictures are for display purposes only.\n\nAll shipping will be calculated and charged separately through the pledge manager option after the campaign is over.

It takes the exploration that I enjoy so much about The 7th Continent while refining its gameplay by streamlining the mechanics in a way that\u2019s both fresh and entertaining. Adventure gaming at its best!\u201d Jeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\"If 7th Continent was the journey, then 7th Citadel is the destination. This is a great evolution of the game mechanics.

Controlled by a mysterious individual, these elongated worms tirelessly dig underground tunnels, causing swathes of territory to sink into the bowels of the earth. \nAfter years of helplessness, the Protectorate finally found a defense against this scourge in the Necrodruids \u2013 men and women who rejected the sacred principles of the Druidic Order to draw upon blood and forbidden incantations. The Necrodruids used their blood rituals to create monstrous plant-creatures capable of combating the Burrowers.\nIn the Citadels, the Necrodruids\u2019 power centers, YOU grow and tend to the abominations developed within, whose seeds are then spread all over the world to protect the territory against the Burrowers. Working as a slave-gardener, you wish that a fatal accident or death by exhaustion would relieve you of your endless toil.\nThe world has clearly changed since the days of your forefathers. The Collapsing Lands are choked in gloom and dust belched up by the Burrowers. The horrific plant-creatures that were created to protect you have spread, sometimes out of control, and are now just as much of a threat to humanity as the Burrowers.\nOn a cold morning bathed in pale light, you awaken for another long day of hard labor in the sacred grove, unaware that this will be your last day at the Citadel and that the course of history is about to change...\n\nSolo or cooperative game for up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure per Threat.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where you are the hero!\nNo die rolls: the more energy you spend, the more you increase your chances of success, but the faster you burn out!\nLive a different adventure every time; there are countless surprises and the game remembers your choices!\nEarn new skills, unlock bonuses, construct buildings: your decisions determine your path. Choose your destiny!\nIn The 7th Citadel, you face a Threat which will inevitably come down on you (unless you perish before you get there!).\nEach Threat comes in the form of a booklet with several scenarios that follow one another, until the final scenario where you either win the game or succumb to the Threat.\nUnlike most board games, you will experience an adventure over time, but rest assured, a simple save system allows you to pause your game at any time to resume it later.\nYou are a slave-gardener, captive of The 7th Citadel for several years now.\nYou start the game by choosing one of the available characters. Each character has an optional quest and a personal Action Deck.\nCasek, female (front) and male (back) version of a playable character\nCasek's personal quest\nAs your adventure progresses, you will choose new skills to create the character YOU want to play. Far from the usual archetypes of warrior, mage, and healer, you will have the freedom to develop your character as you choose.\nAre you more into Cunning or Arcana?\nWhether you want to play a teenage arcane master with a slingshot, an eloquent adventurer who can sneak through the shadows, or an elderly swordsman who summons creatures to assist him in battle, the choice is yours!\nYou progress in the adventure by exploring the Collapsing Lands (the game board, made up of numbered cards).\nHere you undertake actions that usually result in taking numbered cards from the Adventure Deck to progress through the adventure. These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card. Whenever you take a Terrain card stored after that divider (card nr. 111 and up), you must replace 1 Exploration card attached to that terrain with one showing the \u201cPeril\u201d (skull) icon.\nLuckily, you possess a Groundquaker, a powerful artifact stolen from the Necrodruids, which will help you push the divider further back and with it the edge of peril!\nWe\u2019ve been working on The 7th Citadel for over a year now.\nThe game\u2019s mechanics have been heavily tested over the last few months.

Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 20 years, in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign.

Sometimes this leads to parts of our production process working slower than we had planned or forecast. If this happens, we will let you, the most important people in this project, know what has happened and what we intend on doing about it.\n\nIn essence we commit to keeping our backers updated to any changes or developments when they happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Solo Adventurer", "descp": "Approx $25\nGoing it alone ... this solo adventurer pledge gets you 1 Ice Dice tray.\nEach tray makes 7 dice shaped ice blocks.

Only the bravest adventurers dare to explore the secrets of the frozen wastes!\nMonster Scenery presents: Ice Wilds!  A complete range of icy, wintry scenery, complete with snowy pine trees, frozen hills, tundra game mats, and more!\nTake your games past the bounds of civilization into unexplored, dangerous territories! As pictured, the 6'x4' table includes approximately 25 scenery sets. Click to see a larger version.\nLast year, your support launched the Monster Scenery range.  We\u2019ve gotten tons of rave reviews about our original trees and hills and we\u2019re excited to continue to expand the range and variety!\nIce Wilds introduces an all-new type of evergreen tree.  Like our original trees, the tree tops are removable and every piece can be used on its own as a piece of scenery.   \nThere are four different sizes of tree tops, all of which look good on their own and can be stacked to make towering firs: the taller tree trunk with all four sizes of tree tops is over 10\" (25cm) tall!   \nFully stacked Pines tower over minis and smaller trees alike!\nThe pine trees are available in three styles: green, blighted brown, and wintry white.  Choose which one best matches your adventures!\nThis Ice Wilds campaign also introduces a new style of transparent blue Monster Scenery Hill.  These icy, glacial hills look great on the new wintery maps.  The clear blue brings a new level of dynamic color to the winter landscape.  \n\nCheck out all the sets and pledge levels below to build your Ice Wilds pledge!\n When you join the Monster Scenery: Ice Wilds campaign, you'll choose the Pledge level that includes the number of sets you'd like, then add the value of any Add-ons you want to include.  Like our first Kickstarter campaign, you can mix and match the Ice Wilds sets to create a table that\u2019s exactly what you want!\nThere are pledge levels between one and thirty sets, so whether you're playing small skirmish games or hosting tournaments you can choose the pledge level that's right for you. The higher your pledge level, the less expensive each set will be. Additional sets are the same price per set as your pledge level.\nWhen the pledge manager opens, you'll be able to use the value of your pledge towards any of the products featured in this campaign.  For example, if you pledge at the $280 level you could get eight painted sets for $35 each (normally $40 each).  But if you'd prefer, you could use also use some of your pledge to get a game mat or other add ons.  And if you want to go bigger, you can include additional painted sets at the same $35 per set price.\nExplore Pine Forests year round! Pine trees in green and blighted brown shown on the scrubland Monster Game Mat. As pictured, this table includes approximately 20 scenery sets.\nAs the campaign progresses, you'll unlock stretch goals that add new items to the sets and free pieces for every shipment!\nCheck out the selection of sets and add-ons, then choose your pledge level!\n\nAs you venture northward, the leaves start to thin, then disappear. Evergreen pines dominate the landscape, eventually giving way to glacial ice.\nThe new pine trees look good right on the tabletop and you can vary their height by placing them on one of the trunks.  Plus the trees can be stacked on top of each other to make even taller trees!\n\n\n\nThe Pine forest set is available in three different styles: Evergreen, Blighted Brown, and Winter White.  Each Pine Tree set comes with seven treetops, two trunks, and a double-sided forest floor template. The new template is neoprene, with a pine-needle forest floor on one side and a water feature on the other.  \nDouble-Sided Pine Forest Floor Neoprene Template: Included with Evergreens and Blighted Pines\nDouble-Sided Ice Wilds Neoprene template: Included with Winter Pines, Winterfall Forest, and Glacial Icefields\n\n Backers familiar with our first scenery Kickstarter will recognize the shapes: as the popular rocky hills from that campaign. That means these combine perfectly with the hills you already have. These winter hills look great combined with the gray rock hills to make frozen, rocky terrain.\nThe Ice Hills are available in three different styles: Snowy, Frosted Ice, and Glacial Ice. The Snowy Hills are fully painted in a blue and white color scheme. The Glacial Ice Hills are fully transparent blue.  The Frosted Ice Hills are the clear blue hills with a frosty white accent.\nThe translucent plastic is a terrific effect on the tabletop - you haven\u2019t seen hills like this before!  Check it out:\n\nCold brings down the leaves - then ice brings down the trees\u2026\nThe Winterfall forest set combines bare, standing tree trunks with fallen, broken tree trunks and stumps.  These make terrific areas of difficult ground and provide cover from incoming fire.\nThe set includes two double-sided neoprene templates featuring snowy ground on one side and an icy water feature on the reverse.   \nThe glacial icefield set is available in the same three styles as the Ice Hills: Snowy, Frosted Ice, and Glacial Ice.  Each set gives you two areas of frozen ice chunks intermixed with wintry bushes.\nThe set includes two double-sided neoprene templates featuring snowy ground on one side and an icy water feature on the reverse.\nBuilt along ancient roadways, you can still find scattered settlements where sturdy folks carve a life in the harsh environment of the frozen tundra.\nWinding through the frozen landscape, the rivers and roads are key to traveling quickly.  Each river/road segment is double-sided, with a wintery road on one side and an icy river on the other side.   Combined, they\u2019re over 48 inches long!\nFront and back side of a river pieces. Ice Road & River pieces are 3 1/2 inches in width (90mm). Designs subject to some adjustment.\nPLAY\n\nThe full-color graphics are wrapped around clear plastic which gives a real sense of depth to the water!  When you're looking at the river segments, you're actually seeing the water graphics through a layer of clear material - it's a very cool effect that was a bit hit when we introduced it with the Monster Scenery Crystal Clear ponds.\nStanding taller and longer than the bygone people who built them, the Ancient Ruins sets includes four ruined corners - including one ruined wall with a gothic doorway and a taller ruined corner that stands 11\" (280mm) tall!\nAll the Ancient Ruins pieces are compatible with the wall system introduced in the Monster Scenery: Metropolis Kickstarter. The full color, tempered hardboard walls push-fit into the plastic corners to create buildings that are durable and easy to assemble and disassemble.\nFull-Color Hardboard means these ruins are ready to game right out the box, no painting requried! Just click together and get adventuring.\n Expand your winter wonderland with a variety of Add-ons. When choosing the sets for your pledge, you can also count any combination of two $20 Add-ons as a \u201cset\u201d.  If you want to include Add-ons in your pledge, simply increase the amount of your pledge by the total amount of the Add-ons you want to include. \nThe Monster Scenery Game Mats are durable, versatile game mats for all your tabletop adventures. Every Monster Scenery mat is designed to match the painted Monster Scenery.\nEvery mat is double-sided and printed on thin, lay-flat neoprene. They're available in a variety of sizes and are designed to look good when placed side-by-side with each other.\nMany of the sizes are available printed with a 1\" grid.\nA few scattered icy rocks quickly turn this ice floe into an arctic ocean!\nSmall = 1.5\" Long Medium = 3.5\" Long Large = 3.75\" Long\nSmall = 1.5\" Long Medium = 3.5\" Long Large = 3.75\" Long\nThe popular Monster Scenery bushes return in two new styles: Winter Bushes, with a light dusting of snow, and Autumn bushes, in a warm brown. Each bush is large enough to be an obstacle to shooting and movement for 28-35mm miniatures.  These look great in and around the ice hills and forests.\n\nEach Winter Foliage Add-on includes three snow-covered treetops.  These can be used on their own as large shrubs and are compatible with the standing tree trunks from the Winterfall Forest set (and previous Monster Scenery tree trunks).\nEach Ice Crystals Add-on includes four medium crystal formations and two large crystal formations. The large formations can fit together to make even larger formations! These are perfect for creating areas of dangerous terrain, adding magical elements to the table, or using as objectives for your games.\nWood Fence section = 3\", Wood Fence Corner = 1.5\" square *models supplied unpainted\n Carve out civilization in the deep frozen forests with this Wood Fence. This sturdy and tall pine wall will help keep the beasts at bay, at least for a little while. Connect up the straights and corners to surround your camp, or build a long picket for your soldiers to hold back the enemy.\n\n Loyal companion or vicious beast? This wolf pack includes 3 unique wolf sculpts for use in your adventures, unlocked as part of our 75k stretch goal.\n\n\n Perfect for arctic and forest environments, its not uncommon to see bears of all types roaming around on your travels. Set includes one walking and one standing bear. \nGet across the tundra in style with a bear-pulled sled. Set includes 3 unique harnessed bears, and a sled with removeable cargo. Click your mini's base onto the back of the sled and set off on your journey!\nPenguins travel in waddles! 8 Penguin miniatures for your polar trek, featuring 4 unique poses. Unlocked as our 115k stretch goal. \nThe work of a mad mage, or merely nature's doing? This mighty beast roams the ice challenging anyone who infringes on its territory. Bring your players a unique encounter with the Dire Penguin!\nTake shelter from the storm, search for lost adventurers, or use it as an objective - either way, the Hunter's camp is a useful destination on your tabletop.\n\n Note on Stretch Goals: In the first Monster Scenery Kickstarter, the stretch goals were painted.  Due to Covid-related closures and shutdowns, that's not going to be possible this time around.  But these pieces are super quick and fun to paint!\n\nFor the first time, we're offering unpainted versions of some of the most popular Monster Scenery sets!  These are the same detailed sculpts found in the painted sets, ready for your brush!\nEach unpainted set is $30 and includes the same pieces you'd get in the painted version, including all unlocked stretch goals for that set!  Unpainted sets do not include the neoprene templates.   \nA Note On Scale\nMonster Scenery is designed to be used with a variety of tabletop miniature games.  Monster Scenery works well with miniature scales between 28-40mm.  \u201cNatural\u201d scenery like trees and rocks is pretty forgiving when it comes to scale. The same tree can look good with a wider range of miniatures - the taller the miniature, the smaller the tree looks!\nThe first Monster Scenery Kickstarter was a big hit and got rave reviews when the finished scenery was delivered.  Check out some of the reviews and unboxings from our first campaign:\nGeek Orthodoxy wrote up a great review.  From their summary, \"Overall, I am pleased with the products. The coloring and shading looks nice\u2013certainly better than I could do. Really good painters may scoff, but decent looking pre-painted terrain is a major selling point for me.\"\nThere Will be Games says in their review, \"I really like these little touches as they create much more of a complete environment,\" along with \"This is one of the better pre-painted terrain choices I've seen out there- great quality and a very reasonable price for ready-to-play scenery.\"\nMust Contain Minis wrote, \"A lot of thought and effort went into the packaging of this company\u2019s products. They look nice in the box and even better on the outside. When taking the terrain out for the first time, I felt it was good enough to go.\"\nInkdmage on Instagram gave high praise saying, \"Monster Fight Club is hands-down the ArchMage of wilderness 3D terrain for role playing and war gaming,\" along with \"The aesthetics, sturdiness and cost of their product line are enough to put them at the top of this industry\u2019s hill; and their reliability for stocked products, both on their website and in retail, secure the position of leader of the pack.\"\nSkirmish Wargames backed the first campaign (thanks!) and posted a video run-through of his pledge shipment: \"I'm really impressed with the whole set, actually. Obviously, a lot of thought was put into this and someone really took time to consider how the miniatures were going to interact with the terrain and how the terrain pieces were going to fit together\".\nCrabbok talks through his Monster Scenery collection in a video: \nAnd Naomi from Sword 'n' Steele unboxes a shipment of Monster Scenery:\nBased on your location, we will either ship to you from our hub in Europe (EU backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the United States (USA and the rest of the world).\nShipping will be calculated based on the size and weight of your pledge in the Pledge Manager.  We do our best to provide affordable shipping, but shipping is getting more expensive and we can't provide exact shipping quotes until we know how much will be in your shipment.  If you know what you want your pledge to include, you can email us at info@monsterfightclub.com and we can try to get an estimate.\nBackers who do not complete their Pledge Manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via e-mail notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from our US location. This may incur additional shipping costs to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.\nDue to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally.\nMonster Fight Club is a close-knit team of hobby industry veterans whose purpose is to evolve tabletop gaming through fun and unique board game experiences; innovative accessories, terrain and models for tabletop role-playing games and wargaming; and creating distinctive pop culture collectibles.\nThe team behind Monster Fight Club includes many former staff members of Gale Force Nine, including its founder, John Kovaleski.

After that, we have a policy of no questions asked refunds, but that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and may lead to project delays which could impact your fellow backers. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Again, we regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter\nQuestions about this project?

Initially you will receive a bridge, bridge walls and a guardhouse, big enough to use for large scale battalions and smaller skirmish games. These pieces will be expanded on much, much further with the stretch goals, allowing you to have ruined pieces, warehouses, guildhalls, more river walls and residential buildings to adorn the top of the bridge. You don't need to limit this to being a riverside dwelling, you could make this a full scale port if you wished! It will be a great addition to Lord Cireneg's City but also a complete piece in its own right! \nSTL files are scaled for 28mm gaming.\nThe bridge is a massive piece to use on your tabletop. It is slightly over 20cm wide with a modular design that lets you make it as long as you wish, giving you plenty of space to game upon. You could have an entire scenario just on this piece alone! The gentle slope lets miniatures stand when placed upon the bridge (unless they have a poor centre of gravity) and the cobbled texture stops them sliding. Each arch section is 20cm long (made of 2x 10cm long pieces) and the ramp up is just short of 40cm. The first social goal is to make a shorter set of steps leading up to the top of the bridge to allow you to game on a smaller space if you so desire.\nPLAY\n\nLarge Cuts\n...and smaller cuts for smaller printers\nThe Gatehouse is a stack-able piece that provides a break along the bridge between attackers and defenders. The portcullis is able to be raised and lowered allowing for a simple entrance to the city or for you to play siege games. A draw Bridge has been added to this through the stretch goals.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nlarge cuts\nsmall cuts\nThe Bridge Walls allow you to make the bridge look even more grand with walls lining the river. This adds a section to access the bridge and some great little nooks where beggars and ruffians can hide out. A great set of pieces to help out with an urban waterway. The walls are optional, you can still use the Bridge without them. There are plenty of goals allowing for a wide variety of looks to the walls and even buildings that attach to them.\nPLAY\n\nbasic wall pieces (many more to be added with stretch goals)\nPLAY\n\nHow the walls slot together.\nThe Witch's Hovel can be added to your pledge by increasing your pledge amount by NZ$20. \nHere is a quick list of the stretch goals unlocked so far. For more detail see further down this project.\nNZ$1000 - Wall Front Steps\nNZ$2000 - Alternate Wall Front\nNZ$3000 - Jetty\nNZ$4000 - Rowboat\nNZ$5000 - Sewer Wall front\nNZ$6000 - Small Building\nNZ$7000 - Building 1\nNZ$8000 - Building 2\nNZ$9000 - Building 3\nNZ$10000 - Bridge Ruins\nNZ$12500 - Alternate Roof\nNZ$15000 - Wall Steps, Cityside\nNZ$17500 - Alternate Cityside Wall\nNZ$20000 - Alternate Riverside walls x 4\nNZ$22500 - Draw Bridge\nNZ$25000 - Big Pier\nNZ$27500 - Warehouse\nNZ$30000 - Guildhouse\nNZ$35000 - Wide Bridge\nNZ$37500 - Wall Ends\nSocial Stretch Goal - Shorter Ramp/Steps\nBONUS - 22.5\u00b0 River Wall Bend\nBONUS 2 - Bridge Building Base\nClick the link to download many of the free designs (or purchase other designs) from my store at DriveThruRPG. Some are pay what you want so if you like them you could spend a little bit if you so desire. These are not specifically associated with this campaign but many will be useful to fill out the Bridge District.\nRoughly US $0.66, \u00a30.50, \u20ac0.56\nIf you are just keen to stay up to date with things and see how the campaign pans out, then this is the pledge for you!\nRoughly US $33, \u00a325, \u20ac28  \nThis pledge level will get you the Bridge, The Gatehouse and the Bridge Walls. This also includes any applicable stretch goals that may be unlocked.     \nRoughly US $99, \u00a375, \u20ac84 \nIf you want to add a city to the Bridge District then this is the pledge level for you. You get everything stated in the \"Bridge District\" pledge level plus all of the unlocked files from Lord Cireneg's City. This includes city residential buildings, all jam packed together to create a bustling city feel, plus the inn, the gallows, the market and the bell tower. This saves around NZ$50 on the full price of the city. Definitely value for money here!\nRoughly US $132, \u00a3100, \u20ac112\nIf a Bridge district and a city aren't enough for you then you can add a castle into the mix as well. This gives you everything from the \"Riverton: Bridge and City\" pledge level plus you get Sir Cireneg's City (before he was made a lord). This adds in the castle walls and towers, plus all the interior buildings like the smithy, kitchen, Lord's Hall and more! This also includes ruined versions of the walls and towers too. This is a saving of around NZ$90 from both the city and the castle.\nThe first social stretch goal is a shorter set of steps up to the bridge. This measures around 14cm long instead of the longer ramp. Great for fitting into a small space on the tabletop. Share this post pinned to the top of my Facebook page and once we get to 20 shares on Facebook this goal will be unlocked!\nOnce we reach the amounts shown these extra pieces will be added to your pledge. The stretch goals shown may not be indicative of the final designs, most have been completed and many test printed.\n This goal provides a set of steps down to the river.\n A new river front section to add more variety to the walls of the river. \n A Jetty for at the bottom of the first stretch goal.\n Tie the row boat up to the jetty.\n A sewer entrance, a great place to have a nasty surprise or an objective point for a game, maybe the start of a new scenario?\n A thin building that will sit atop the bridge. \n The first of three buildings. These will all have interchangeable pieces. Each level is made of a front and back section that can be swapped with other buildings as well.\n The second building for your bridge. Really help make the bridge district a thriving place.\n And a third building type!\n 10K is a great mark to bring in the ruined bridge. Complete with a rickety looking bridge.\n Another Rooftop for the Bridge buildings, create a different looking skyline with this new goal. That completes all of the residential buildings atop the bridge.\n Steps down to the City. This goal gives you some steps down to the city side of the river from the wall.\nAnother alternate to the city side of the Wall.  \n4 more alternate fronts. These are copies of the of the previous ones but they are created without the barrier wall. Great if you want to have a big ship docking right alongside the wall.\nThe Final Drawbridge has arrow loops to replace the doors.\nThe Drawbridge makes the gatehouse even more secure. This will come with a piece to add to the end of either side of the bridge, a drawbridge and some arrow loops to replace the side doors (not shown). Just add some cheap jewelry chains and it will really look the part.\nThe Pier sits up against the Alternate Wall fronts to create a place for people to fish or catch a big boat for that long voyage.\n\nThe Warehouse can be stacked up multiple levels high. It is built to go against the wall. Add some twine to the pulley to have a rope hanging down to raise goods from the lower level.\n\nThe Guildhouse is a multipurpose building, while it is labelled the Guildhouse it would be great as a dockside tavern or merchants home. It has access from the wall via the steps unlocked previously.\nThe wider bridge at NZ$35K brings you modular parts to make the bridge even wider. This will allow you to make epic battles on the bridge. Certain parts will not be compatible with the wider bridge such as the Gatehouse, Draw Bridge, Ruins and the Shorter Steps up.\n\nThe Wall ends adds some steps down to the end of the walls. Great for finishing of the ends of the walls and allowing more access to the higher level.\nFulfillment of Lord Cireneg's Bridge District will be completed through DriveThruRPG. Each backer will receive copies via their account. Fulfillment will begin as soon as possible. This should hopefully be within 2 weeks of the project funding. A survey will be sent out shortly after the project has funded to gather email addresses associated with DriveThruRPG accounts. Please note, this is the only way to gain these files. It will be advantageous to you as you will then have the files in your library so you can access them as often as you would like.\nHere are some printed examples so you can see what they can look like when printed and painted. These were painted with a quick acrylic spray followed by craft paints and then a shade. I'm no professional painter as the pictures show and I didn't pay anyone to paint these to a high quality standard but they still look great on the tabletop!\nThe Gatehouse\nThe Ruins Stretch Goal (without the rickety bridge)\nThe Drawbridge Stretch Goal, lowered.

In 2020 alone, Philip has personally launched, produced, and delivered eight different Kickstarter projects . . . and that doesn't count his day job!\nDuring the mid-2000s, Philip wrote and produced PDF game supplements, creating an extensive catalog of content (including treasures, feats, spells, classes, and encounter ideas) that gamemasters used in their campaigns. \nWith decades of experience writing, producing, manufacturing, and delivering game content, Philip is well-suited to seeing this project through to the very end.\nFind Philip's PDFs at DrivethruRPG! \nI am working with BackerKit for this latest project.

As with my previous campaigns, I will post project updates to let all backers know the status of the work.\nAdditionally, none of the new content -- or the stretch goal content! -- has been written. If this project closes successfully, then I will start creating the new material. The process will include a review stage where project backers get the chance to read the rumors and report any typos or errors that may have been missed. The review stage is necessary to cleaning up those pesky typos before the project is finalized.\nHardcover edition, digital mockup.

However, things can go bad. As an individual, I do not have access to a company to assist when things go wrong, and I have no control over life. Everything should deliver on schedule. If something goes off the rails, I will post an update to explain the situation.\n\nThe biggest challenge for this project is using DrivethruRPG coupon codes to fulfill the print rewards. This is a new approach for me and I will need time to check/test/verify the print books before I send out the codes. The other challenge directly related to these codes is the risk of misunderstanding. I am doing all I can to make it clear that backers will have to pay printing and shipping costs to receive the printed books. Please see the FAQ for more info.\n\nNOTE: At project launch, none of the new content has been written. If the campaign closes successfully, and stretch goals are unlocked, then I'll start the serious task of writing the new content necessary to complete the book.

Once all players have played and passed, all players reveal their played card, add the passed cards from their neighbors to their hands, and draw a new card from the deck.

The following shows what miniatures are included in each pack. Simply add $4 to your pledge for each additional pack you want.

To add another Deck of Reference Cards to your Pledge (+glossary card); 11 cards total, with a tuck box; please add $10 to your pledge total!\n\nUPDATE #18: Fur Lined Bag revealed!\nThe winter-themed Fur Lined Bag of Tricks is made of heavy leather and trimmed with warm fur. It contains creatures well-suited for icy-terrains. This bag is a must for adventurers who intend to face the frost-bitten cold of the harshest snowy climates, like the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale. It is a Rare Magic Item.\nAnd... to celebrate Rime of the Frostmaiden, we are offering a small extra bonus. \nScroll down to see summaries of all of the Unlocked Stretch Goals, SEVEN brand new Bag of Tricks designs, for a total of TEN Reference Cards to be included in every pledge.\nThe Bag of Tricks is a classic uncommon wondrous magic item found in the Dungeon Masters Guide and Basic Rules for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. This magic item allows a player to pull a small fuzzy object from within which transforms into a random beast (from a roll table) when thrown. \nNeed a distraction? POOF! Giant Goat in the thieves den. \nStuck in a tight spot? BAM! Dire wolf in the jailhouse. \nTime for shenanigans? POP! Baboon in the lords privy. \nAll around, the Bag of Tricks is a magic item which encourages creativity and has almost endless versatility in social, combat, or exploration encounters. \nThere are three original Bag of Tricks colors. The Rust, Gray, and Tan bag. Each which includes a different set of creatures.\nOriginal illustration of the Rust Bag of Tricks by Roman Grigorev.\n\"Anyone have the stats for a Giant Badger?\"\nUnfortunately, to get the most out of the Bag of Tricks players need to keep up to eight different creature stat-blocks ready to go any time they want to use it, or else risk slowing down the game. What's worse, is that the size of the summoned creatures can range anywhere from Tiny to Huge, making scrambling for improvised combat tokens a nuisance. \nI have seen players stop using magic items like the Bag of Tricks because of how cumbersome they can be to play with at the table. And that, my friends, is truly lamentable. \nTo remedy this tragedy, we at MYRIAD have taken it upon ourselves to provide a complete solution for this incredibly niche, highly situational, arguably trivial problem that many never knew existed. \nAnd so we present.... \nThe Bag of Tricks (revisited) is the first in the MYRIAD (revisited) series, which aims to enhance role playing experiences by offering creative solutions to obscure tabletop problems.\nWe have taken the three original Bag of Tricks (Gray, Rust, and Tan) and transformed them into an immersive, engaging, and expanded player experience! New Bag Types, custom dice, creature tokens, and more!\nEverything a player needs to make the most of their in-game Bag of Tricks is included in this Kickstarter and will ensure faster game play, improved visuals for combat, and increased player immersion. \nWe have knocked our Stretch Goals out of the park! That's it! We're done!\nSeven extra Reference Cards, upgraded packaging, multiple optional Dice Packs, a Glossary Card... Whew! Thank you all!\n\nSTRETCH GOAL DESCRIPTION:\nThis is a brief summary of all Unlocked and future Stretch Goals!\nUNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS\n $2,000 - CAMPAIGN FUNDED! Thank you!\n $3,000 - Azure Bag of Tricks Unlocked! Aquatic creatures with a Swim Speed.\n $4,000 - Olive Bag of Tricks Unlocked!

Thank you all. \nEach Bag of Tricks (revisited) pledge includes three (now, TEN!) over-sized Reference Cards with original artwork, Glossary Card, a Dice Pack of three color-matched D8's, an engraved three-piece wooden Creature Size Token, a velvet drawstring pouch and professional full-color tuck box and engraved gift box for storage.\nAnd that's it. Just a clean, efficient, practical, grab-and-go, tight little package.\nHow do I use the Reference Cards?\nThe core element of the Bag of Tricks (revisited) are the Reference Cards. They have been designed to save significant time for everyone at the table, and allow the player to use the Bag of Tricks as soon as they get it with zero page-turning or web-browsing required.\nWhen your character receives a Bag of Tricks throughout your adventures simply grab the respective Reference Card from the Bag of Tricks (revisited) card sleeve and keep it alongside your character sheet.\nFerocious and exotic creatures ready to aid your party.\nWhen the time comes to use your Bag of Tricks, roll the color-matched D8 (covered below) and use the roll-table on your Reference Card to see the which creature you summon, then simply flip the Reference Card over and you have your creatures statistics ready to go! No Monster Manual needed!\nUNLOCKED BONUS CARDS:\n\n\nThe Azure Bag of Tricks is filled with aquatic and amphibious creatures, each of which feature a defined Swim Speed. This Bag was designed for encounters that might occur outside of the typical forest or dungeon environments, where flippers are more useful than feet! It is an Uncommon Magic Item. \nThe Olive Bag of Tricks contains leafy objects which are concentrated motes of Feywild magic. Conjure fey spirits, sentient plants, or forest guardians to aid you on your journey. It is a Rare Magic Item. \nLike it's namesake, the Patchwork Bag can summon creatures whose features are one-step outside of typical bounds of nature. The Patchwork Bag is well suited for eccentric Player Characters with a fascination for bizarre and creatures with peculiar abilities. It is a Rare Magic Item. \nThe Tattered Bag of Tricks* is a favorite among those who appreciate the beauty in the grim and macabre. This bag is perfect for Necromancers, shifty Rogues, or any character with a darker nature. It's also a good choice for your campaign villians! It is a Rare Magic Item.\nThe Saddle Bag of Tricks* is a magic item of convenient conveyence! Each creature that can be summoned is one that can be ridden as a Mount, and is conjured fully equipped with saddle, reins, and associated tack. It is an Uncommon Magic Item. \nThe Gossamer Bag of Tricks* is the epitome of flight. Inspired by the Air Genasi, each creature within the Gossamer Bag of Tricks has a Fly speed. But we're not talking about a flock of run of the mill birds here. Flying swords, stone creatures, and winged beasts! It is a Rare Magic Item.\nThe winter-themed Fur Lined Bag of Tricks is made of heavy leather and trimmed with warm fur. It contains creatures well-suited for icy-terrains. This bag is a must for adventurers who intend to face the frost-bitten cold of the harshest snowy climates, like the frigid tundra of Icewind Dale. It is a Rare Magic Item.\n\n BONUS! GLOSSARY CARD\nIn order to keep the Stat Blocks as clean as possible we did have to apply some short-hand for some of the creatures Special Traits (referred to as Features on the Reference Cards). These include things like the ravens Mimicry ability, or the wolfs Pack Tactics. Since the whole purpose of these cards is to reduce the amount of time Googling miscellaneous details or flipping through the Monster Manual, we have opted to include a Features Glossary.\nClick here to view Update 12 for a full preview of the Glossary Card.\nCard Details:\nEach card is printed on durable, high-quality cardstock, features original artwork, and measures an impressive 5\" x 7\" (slightly smaller than a half of a piece of paper). We found this is a perfect size to make all the text legible, while still small enough to allow players to tuck the Reference Card into notebooks, binder sleeves, or in their dice tray at the end of the session. \nThe front of each card includes the full length magic item description, a beautiful original illustration, and the creature roll table for the respective colored Bag of Tricks (gray, rust, or tan). \nThe back of the card is dedicated entirely for creature stat blocks. Great pains were taken to ensure a clean, legible, easy to find layout for the monster statistics.\nMost reference cards include only one creature, but we found a way to cram eight (8) full stat blocks on each card. Impressive, no?\n Worried the text is too small? \nWhile we're confident our designs are actually more legible than existing first and third party reference cards, you can click here for a printable PDF sample card!\nLegal Disclaimer: All of the information included on the Reference Cards is taken exclusively from the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition Systems Reference Document (SRD) and is used freely under the Open Gaming License (OGL). \nBe prepared with double-sided Creature Size tokens for your new furry companion.\nBut what about combat?\nWell, the Bag of Tricks (revisited) also includes a stunning laser engraved wooden Creature Size Token for use on your battle-maps!\nThis token is a combat-aid comprised of three modular double-sided Birch circles. No matter what size creature the player summons they will have a table-top marker ready to place on the table.\nCOMMUNITY TIP! Some players may also choose to use these markers for Wild Shape!\nThe rings are designed to fit together to represent creatures of any size. \nThe smallest circle can be used for Tiny (T), Small (S), and Medium (M) creatures\nIf you summon a Large (L) creature then you just add-on the middle ring\nIf you summon a Huge (H) creature you use all three rings. \nDon't know creature sizing rules? Simply match your Creatures letter on the reference card to the letter on the ring and you're all set. \n\"What if I have multiple creatures in combat?\"\nWhile we feel one Creature Size Token is enough for most players, if you intend on having multiple beasts conjured at one time during Combat, consider adding on additional Creature Tokens to your pledge ($5 CAD for one, $8 CAD for two) to make sure each beast has a token.  \nAdditional Acrylic options!\nIf you would prefer an acrylic Creature Token, you may also select from the list below!\nLet it Roll with themed Dice Packs\nEach Bag of Tricks (revisited) pledge also includes a Dice Pack of three (3) color-matched D8 dice with a unique stitched design to foster player immersion. If a player receives the Gray Bag of Tricks in-game, well, then they receive the Gray D8 to keep at their side!\nCapture the feeling of reaching into your Bag of Tricks by rolling the color-matched Dice!\nChoose your Dice Pack!\n Dice Pack 1: Rust (red) Dice, Tan (yellow) Dice, and Gray (gray) Dice \n Dice Pack 2: Azure (blue), Olive (green), and Patchwork (purple) Dice\n Dice Pack 3: Tattered (black), Saddle (brown), and Gossamer (pink) Dice\nPledges beginning at $40 CAD will include ALL 3 Dice Packs! \nWhen it's time to pack up for the night... \n Component storage can be the bane of any tabletop or board game player so wanted to include a velvet drawstring bag to comfortably hold the Bag of Tricks (revisited) Dice Packs, multiple Creature Size Tokens, as well as a bunch of your own dice! The drawstring bag measures 4\" x 5.5\" and is laser engraved with our Creature Size Token design.\nTuck Box will be in FULL COLOR!\nSimilarly, you can stow your Reference Cards in-between game sessions with the included Tuck Box (design pending) and presentation storage box. The storage box is engraved with artistic designs taken from the campaign.\nOriginal illustration of the Gray Bag of Tricks by Roman Grigorev.\n The Pledge Tiers for this campaign are: \n$22 CAD - Bag of Tricks (revisited)\n$30 CAD - Bag of Tricks (revisited) + 2x Creature Tokens\n$32 CAD - Bag of Tricks (revisited) + Dice Pack 2\n$40 CAD - Bag of Tricks (revisited) + Dice Pack 2 + 2x Creature Tokens\n$40 CAD - Bag of Tricks (revisited) + Dice Pack 2 and 3 (Save $2) \n$46 CAD - Bag of Tricks + Dice Pack 2 and 3 + 2x Creature Tokens (Save $4) \n + Add-ons: Extra Decks of Reference Cards (cards only) - $10 CAD\n + Add-ons: Two Extra Creature Tokens - $8 CAD\n + Add-ons: Extra Dice Packs - $10 CAD\n + Add-ons: Add extra Creature Tokens and Dice Packs as desired.\n\nPlease note all prices are in Canadian Dollar (USD equivalent shown).\nREMINDER: The matching D8 Dice for the Fur Lined Bag of Tricks will be included free in all pledges over $30 CAD! \n\n\nTo purchase multiple Bags of Tricks (revisited), additional tokens, or Dice Packs, simply add on the extra amount to your pledge. \nThere are no additional shipping costs for extra units or add-ons.\nShipping costs (tracking included):\nUnited States - USPS First Class Mail - $8 CAD\nCanada - CanadaPost Flat-Rate Parcel - $13 CAD (see note below) \nInternational - USPS First Class International - $18 CAD \nWe are endeavoring for Christmas delivery, but with COVID and the USPS postal situation, please understand that minor delays may be unavoidable.\nPlease note: International shipment may incur longer delivery windows. \nWe are customs-friendly for International backers. \nWho is MYRIAD Tabletop Innovations?\nFor nearly 10 years we have primarily operated as Chinook Crafts, a home-based small business that has specialized in manufacturing and selling the most wonderful kinds of homemade nostalgic geekery.

We've got the know-how and the means to execute this project with very little risk. \nOriginal illustration of the Tan Bag of Tricks by Roman Grigorev.\nFulfillment Timeline:\nFor North American backers we are on track for a very-likely (but very tight) Christmas 2020 delivery. International customers can expect an extra 2-4 weeks to account for the mail delays during the holiday season and COVID related delays. \nWe are confident in our delivery schedule. In preparation for this campaign we have completed almost all of the back-end work. All rewards are fully designed and ready to be sent to the manufacturers, and our budget is also rock solid, so all we really need is the funding.\nProduction details:\nThe bags and card sleeves have a one-week turn around from local vendors and our laser engraver is an in-house piece of equipment.\nQ-Workshop has a wonderful track record for quick turn around on custom dice for small-run orders. \nOur card printer is in full operation during COVID and has a 3-4 week turn around. \nThank you!\nThank you for taking the time to read and hopefully support this campaign! \nIf you have any questions I can be contacted through Kickstarter, or through e-mail at MyriadTabletop (at) gmail.com. \nAt MYRIAD, we aim to be transparent with our collaborators and do our best to support the talents of independent entrepreneurs.

Details Here.\nHello! We're Andrew and Jared - a couple of engineers who specialize in making customizable gaming miniatures. Since we released DesktopHero 2 at the end of last year, more than 30,000 people have used it to design their own minis.\nHeroes make an essential part of any adventure - but they're only half the story. Today we're pleased to bring you the other side of the conflict. \nWant to help your players feel the battle?\nGive them a monster that exactly matches your campaign, rather than rewriting your campaign to fit your available minis.\nWant to give your players a sense of progression in their boss fights?\nBring back a defeated monster to fight again, showing the wounds it took in the previous battle.\nWant to blow your players' expectations out of the water?\nGive them amazing monsters to fight.\nWe designed TitanCraft to be easy to use, yet powerful in what you can create.\nStart by Loading a Basic Monster.\nThese are monster templates for you to use as a starting point. Want to make a fire demon with tentacles for arms? How about a skull aberration with spidery crab legs?\nThese pages can also serve for inspiration if you don't know quite what you want yet. \nAdd clothing, body parts and items.\nBrowse the library of parts and find what your monster needs.\nWe've got tentacles! Eyeballs! Horns! Wings! Claws! A set of hats because Jared thought there should be some!\nBorrow parts from other monsters and attach them wherever you think they should go.\nOne-click pose presets.\nPosing monsters is super simple - TitanCraft gives you a menu of easy presets so you can quickly try out new poses and find one that fits.\nOr, if you already know exactly what you want:\nCreate Your Own Poses.\nEach monster part has an internal skeleton made of posable bones. You can select any of these bones and use simple tools to move them around, rotate them, and change their size.\nYou can give your monster any pose you can imagine.\nEdit Proportions.\nProportions sliders give you additional control over your monster's appearance.\nYou can control individual parts separately, or modify all similar parts at the same time to give it a uniform look.\nAnd, if you're looking for a specific style, you can pop open the Advanced panel and edit proportions bone-by-bone. This allows you to create some cool effects like super-sharp horns or alternating ridges on tentacles.\nOrder it Delivered. \nWhen your monster is ready, add it to your cart along with any extras you want. Our 3D printing partners will bring it to life and pop it in the mail so it can grace the table during your next game session.\nOr, Download and 3D Print at Home.\nIf you're the kind of person who has a 3D printer (or three or five), good on you! You know the secret to super inexpensive miniatures!\nTitanCraft is perfect for 3D printing DMs; Once you've unlocked a monster, you can customize and download as many variations of it as you want without having to pay for it again.\nGot the pose wrong on your fire demon?\n        Just re-pose it and download a new STL.\nWant to create separate versions of your monster for different encounters?\n        Won't cost you anything extra.\nWant to create a whole army of baby aberrations?\n        It's already unlocked, go ahead and make a hundred.\nSave and Share Your Creations.\nIf you've made a monster you particularly like, you can generate a unique URL pointing to it. Once you've got that URL, you can save it to load your monster again later, or share it so your friends can check out and load your design.\nYou can also use other people's monster URLs as a starting point to create your own monsters.\nWe're aware that backing projects on Kickstarter can feel like a risk. In order for you to feel confident that this project is the real deal, we waited to launch the campaign until after we had an alpha version ready for you to try. \nHead over to titancraftminis.com where you can freely customize, share and download monsters, and get a feel for the tool.\n(Note: Only variations on the aberration monster are available for now.)\n\nA few of our favorite demo creations. Click to edit!\nAny of these 10 monsters can be used as a starting point for customizing your own monsters. Additional monsters will be added as stretch goals and voted on by you, the backers! (See below.)\nUnnatural creatures with alien abilities. Varied in appearance but always deadly to cross.\nHighly intelligent malevolent telepathic eels. Stay out of the water.\nAncient beings of shadow and flame, hungry for chaos and conquest.\nNot the smartest kid in his class, but he saves a fortune on contact lenses.\n\"If you're referring to the incident with the Dragon, I was barely involved.\"\nA mindless mass of jello that envelops anything in its path. Even grandma's fruitcake.\nA towering humanoid with formidable strength.\nCould a griffon and a chimera have a baby lion?\nA slimy blob of acid that wants so badly to be human.\n\"No, we're not going to open that park again! Why do people keep thinking this is a good idea?\"\n For a complete gallery of monster pictures, click here!\nMerchant License Reward Tier\nThe Merchant License reward gives you rights to sell physical prints of your custom monsters. By backing at this level now, you get rights to sell as many prints as you want without the fee per sale that is planned for the non-KS vendors program.\nHere are the details:\nOnly physical prints may be sold - digital files may not be sold or redistributed.\nThis tier gives you rights to sell only the monsters and models unlocked in this Kickstarter.\nThere is no limit to the number of monsters you can sell.\nThese merchant rights do not expire.\nModifying exported STL files using other software tools is allowed. Any file that is produced in this way falls under the same license terms, including that the digital file may not be sold or redistributed.\nYou may not create or sell creations that infringe on another party's intellectual property.\nWe reserve the right to update this license agreement if needed. If this happens, the new license agreement will be posted as a Kickstarter Update and updated on the campaign page.\n Physical Reward Levels\nBecause custom monsters can be infinitely varied, it's difficult to tell ahead of time how much a particular monster will cost to produce. For example, a gargantuan-sized aboleth with 10 tentacles and a pair of widespread wings costs a lot more to produce than a medium-sized aboleth with 4 tentacles and folded wings.\nWe provide 3 categories of miniature rewards: Basic, Standard, and Deluxe.\nHere's a chart to help you understand what you can expect from each monster category, and the tradeoffs between adding extra parts to your model and the total size of your model. \nHand Painted Add-On\nWe are currently looking into providing an optional BackerKit add-on to have your monsters hand-painted by a professional artist! We're still in the process of getting all the details ironed out, and will post an update when we have more information.\nShipping\nPledge prices do not include shipping. Shipping costs will be calculated and collected when you redeem your reward after the Kickstarter campaign has finished. Final shipping costs may vary depending on country and monster miniature size/quantity.\nNote: In order to reduce shipping costs outside the US, we are looking for additional 3D printing partners. If you provide 3D print fulfillment outside the US and can print in MJF Nylon PA 12, please contact us at jared@titancraftminis.com.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTES:  International shipping is currently restricted from certain countries due to COVID-19 service impacts. We don't know how long these restrictions will stay in place, and we will continue to monitor these service impacts. Tracking information may not be available to certain countries. For any questions or concerns you may have, please contact us.\n Update 9/23: Emil at Squidmar Miniatures featured TitanCraft in his latest video. Check it out!\nModels are professionally sculpted with exceptional detail.\nMaterial\nOur monster miniatures are printed with a multi-jet fusion printing technology. \nMJF printing selectively applies fusing and detailing agents across a bed of nylon powders which are fused by heat. After a layer is finished, another bed of nylon powder is distributed on top, and the process repeats.  The unused powder acts as supports for the 3D model getting printing, and is simply vacuumed off when production is complete.  This results in detailed models with none of the blemishes seen in traditional printing or casting methods.\nPainting the Minis\nBecause MJF prints have a slightly coarser texture than cast miniatures, we wanted to make sure they would still be paintable. Here's what mini painter Alex Nelson reported:  \nDurability\nBecause we chose Nylon PA 12 as our printing material, the resulting miniatures are more durable than regular 3D printed minis. They can be handled and transported as needed with a normal level of caution.\nHowever, they can still break if dropped or thrown. If you're worried about how your miniature might be treated, most limbs can be thickened in the software before ordering.\nWe're a 2-man team from Tucson, Arizona with a background in software design, 3D modeling and 3D printing.\nWe are partnering with JawsTec to provide you professional MJF printed models.  Thank you JawsTec team!\nWe also partner with talented freelance artists from all over the world, many of whom have their own websites which we've linked to below.\nA special thanks to Morgan Morey who was one of the first artists to work with us on this project.  Morgan is an extremely talented 3D sculptor who provided us with our balor models.

Chaque semaine, nous postons un recap de ce qu'il s'est pass\u00e9 sur le blog, en fran\u00e7ais : semaine 1 ; semaine 2 ; semaine 3.... Bonne lecture :)\n\"Designed by the creators of Shadows of Esteren and Fateforge, Creatures is a love letter to fantasy bestiaries. Its 400 pages detail more than 200 illustrated creatures using the 5th Edition ruleset of the most famous of roleplaying games. Its contents include 6 playable species, NPCs with related adventure hooks for all levels, reimagined classic creatures and brand new ones, as well as 15 archetypes, providing you with material to design new monsters for your games!\"\nDownload a Preview of Creatures\nWork on Creatures started in France in 2016. It took our studio four years to put together the 400 pages and hundreds of artworks depicting the creatures within. The book is now translated and in the very last steps of being put to PDF and proofread.\nBy backing this campaign, you will immediately be given access to a WIP excerpt from the book. This preview will give you a good idea of the work we put in and of what you will receive. To download this chapter, click the following link. Enjoy !\nMerchant-pirate hobgoblin by Gawain\n\nContents\nHere is a presentation of the book\u2019s highlights. You can also download the table of contents to get an overview of Creatures\u2019 contents.\n Monsters & Adversaries. The world the PCs live in is full of dangers and strange, formidable monsters. Half of the book\u2019s contents will surprise your players by putting a twist on fantasy classics; the other half will bring them face to face with brand new creatures, both friend and foe. A lot of the species are not evil by nature and lethal combat should not be the only option... The book is organized in thematic chapters, allowing the DM to pick creatures suited to the setting and atmosphere that suits them. Discover the creatures of the night, or those of volcanic lands!\nGobelin!\n Playable Species. Many species have been given cultures of their own, as rich and complex as those of humans or elves. Discover 6 new playable species: the wise and formidable ulkani, the dreamer kobolds, the axe beak-riding goblins, the bugbear keepers of sacred forests, the merchant-pirate hobgoblins, and the steppe lord orcs.\n Legendary Creatures. Legendary creatures have also been given particular attention: all have received entirely new lair actions and regional effects, providing material and inspiration for your next scenarios.\n Archetypes. Design one-of-a-kind monsters, drawing from 15 available archetypes, such as vampire spawn, ashen, rabid, haunted\u2026 With these archetypes, you can design memorable antagonists, such as an ezen\u2014a horde leader\u2014or a nemesis tailor-made for your party. Learn more here.\n Animals & Predators. Animals have their own place in the world. More intelligent and with powerful variants, they are part and parcel of this book. For those who wish to play with a more gritty atmosphere, Creatures includes options for new wild predators with higher CRs, making them true, rightly feared threats. In particular, beasts can be made much more dangerous when their profiles are modified by archetypes such as haunted, ashen, or rabid!!\nWild Spirit by Harkale\n Modular system. Creatures makes use of the modular system, a collection of optional rules ranging from epic to gritty, allowing you to fine-tune the atmosphere of your campaign. Each modular rule comes with its associated icon. Learn more here.\nOrc from the Iruuls mountains by Gawain\nStretch Goals\nThe base goal will support the book\u2019s printing. Beyond that, we have several bonuses and upgrades planned to thank you for your support :)\n400K Goal: Gobbler Mini\n500K Goal: Chinchilla Mini\nRewards\nYou can download a full summary of all rewards, add-ons and stretch goals here.\nThere are three available covers for the book of Creatures: \nStandard Edition (1), \nFateforge Edition (2) (both of which will later be available in retail), \nRed Dragon Edition with an alternative cover (3), exclusive to this Kickstarter ($70 reward tier and up). \nOther than the cover, the content of each edition is exactly the same. Copies of the Red Dragon Edition may be available at conventions or during special events, but not in retail. The Fateforge edition makes sense if you collect the other books of the Fateforge series. $70 reward tier and up gives you access to the Red Dragon cover and allows you to choose between the 3 covers. You will choose your cover during the pledge manager.\nStandard, Fateforge and Red Dragon Edition\nRed Dragon Edition by Gawain - Fight the Tarasque!\nThe Creatures: Collector Pack tier gives you access to the limited edition of the book (Red dragon,  alternate cover) but you can decide to receive the Standard or Fateforge  edition instead. You will also receive two exclusive bonuses: 4 printed Lairs in a portfolio and the Appendix, a 40 page full color book of game aids and annexes.\nFateforge RPG Collector Pack\nIn addition to the Book of Creatures: Collector Pack, the Fateforge RPG Collector Pack includes the two core books for Fateforge RPG: Adventurers (book for the  players, hardcover, 400 pages ; more infos here) and Grimoire (spells and magic,  hardcover, 330 pages ; more infos here) + several games aids and bonuses. All this  material is 5th Edition compatible. Grab the last copies of the first  print run with a great discount! Welcome in Eana! You will choose between Standard or Red Dragon editions for your books. Only the covers change.\n\"A tense collection of well thought out 5e rules, exciting twists and a promising setting\"   Geek Native - Read the full review here.\n\"Fateforge is a well written, beautifully designed reenvisioning of 5e.  I've spent hours on Reddit trying to find solutions about how to handle  intrigue, or mysteries, or darker, grittier feel better - a lot of the  time the answer was: \"nah, just use a different system, it's not what 5e  is for\". Studio Agate is proving that with well-thought rules and  useful tips on narration, you can get that feel. Love it.\" Chris L.\n\" Powered by a very robust and highly polished ruleset, Fateforge offers a heroic fantasy universe with a unique French touch: poetic and epic, with a rich lore and in-depth characterization.\" Dice Everywhere\nOptions\nIn the course of the campaign, you can add one or several options to your pledge.\nHow to add options?

[link] \n The Chronolith +$20 (print & PDF). The Chronolith is an original 50-page adventure by Eric Nieudan. It is  compatible with any game making use of the 5E rules, and has been  designed to be played autonomously, sandbox-style, offering great  freedom and many possible twists. Intended for characters of levels 1-5,  it will take the party on a dizzying trip through space and time, and  pit them against dangers both mundane and extraordinary from many ages!

The book is almost ready. Last time, we delivered four months after the end of the KS. We are confident in our schedule but the actual crisis can delay the shipping or customs process. A lot of stretch goals can also extend production time.\n\nBy participating in this campaign, you will follow the uncertain process of designing, manufacturing and delivering a project. There are always risks that the schedule will change. For 10 years, we have dedicated our days and nights to creating these universes. But the risk remains. If you don't want to take this risk, don't participate in this Kickstarter campaign and wait for the public release in 2021. \n\nWe want to thank all the people and the community who have supported our project from the start.

This Kickstarter has been highly anticipated by our customers because we have a huge assortment of amazing terrain along with our outstanding support-free miniatures. We took a little break from terrain because we have been planning Orc Tusklands for quite some time! Once you see this outstanding package, you\u2019ll see that it was worth the wait!\nOrc Tusklands does not require you to have any of our Tilescape products because it\u2019s used as scatter terrain. You can use it with whatever you have on your table and it will incorporate perfectly: just place and play! \nWhat\u2019s New?\nWe have a very exciting announcement to make! We have incorporated an Orc Tusklands Compendium that illustrates our Orc Tusklands creatures, vehicles, and weapons for use with your Dungeons and Dragons 5e settings. We are offering this as a PDF. We will make a reward tier for just the compendium if you don\u2019t have a 3D printer but would still like to delve into the Tusklands!\n\"If you\u2019ve been thinking of adding a 3D printer to your home, this is a great time! Both FDM and SLA printers have become extremely affordable at around the $200 mark for a very reliable machine. There is a plethora of support groups on Facebook so you're never alone in this hobby. This would be a good time to mention our Printing Partners! If you don\u2019t have a 3D printer but would like to have our miniatures and terrain, you can contact one of our licensed printers. They are happy to print for you and ship to your home address. I will include a list of our Printing Partners in the FAQ section.\"\nWhat\u2019s the Same?\nAs always, all of our terrain and miniatures are support-free. What do we mean by support-free? When we created Rocket Pig Games years ago, the only truly affordable and user-friendly printers were FDM. We wanted our customers to have a fun experience with 3D printing. We didn\u2019t want them to struggle with adding supports OR removing them so we create them to be 100% support-free. We don\u2019t have anything \u201cpre-supported\u201d because there are NO supports. You simply print and play...that\u2019s it! If there\u2019s a Deluxe or Epic creature with a dramatic pose or overhangs, it will be professionally sliced and keyed. Each piece will print (without supports) and be ready to assemble. We do not test with resin BUT our customers who do (and there are many) report that many of our miniatures still print support-free with resin or require very few supports. Win Win!\nThe Fun Never Ends!\nIf you enjoy printing unique, support-free miniatures and terrain and want to get started before the Kickstarter ends just head on over to our store or our Patreon! We have the largest selection of support-free miniatures available and it keeps growing every month. There are thousands of files of miniatures and terrain to discover! Please take advantage of our freebie packs of Tilescape and Tilescape 2.0 terrain so you can see first-hand why our modular terrain is the best choice! Check out our FAQ section for a coupon code good for 20% off anything in the store!\nOur store categories are chock-full of .stl goodness! Each one is brimming with more and more files so be sure to fully explore each one.

Choose the one that best suits your needs and sell your prints to pay for your hobby! Every Printing Partner license tier comes with our Patreon miniatures each month.\nVENTURE INTO THE TUSKLANDS\nOn a continent ignored by the world at its own peril, a powerful nation grows stronger as it sharpens its tusks. Orcs and goblins work together to create mighty weaponry and tame dangerous beasts as war hangs over the horizon. But dark forces lurk in the shadows who will stop at nothing to gain power. Discover a landscape of harsh blastlands, mighty empires, and strange creatures in this setting compatible with the world\u2019s most famous RPG.\nOrc Tusklands is an RPG supplement that introduces you to the creatures that inhabit the Tusklands both big and small. Take control of a bestiary of dozens of monsters, ranging from the gigantic tusk titans that wield the land\u2019s most valuable resource, goblin hounds that have mutated into a variety of disturbing beasts, and fiendish demons that seek to control the Tusklands for themselves.\nIn addition to these creatures, this supplement holds statistics for races both new and familiar that have been shaped by the world they inhabit. This includes new racial options for players with the Tuskland Orc and Tuskland Goblin. Within this book, discover a culture of military might and adaptation in a land where every living being must fight to survive.\nOver 70 pages of detailed 5e entries!\nDozens of beautiful illustrations!\nPlayable Tuskland Orc and Goblin races!\nStats for Siege Weapons, Orc Ships, and more!\nDownload the FREE Sample PDF here!\n\nTHREE Core Sets:\n Tusklands: Build your fortress with these modular structures!

Other than this we have collaborated with dozens of Kickstarters during these last two years. Providing models all round to community members in some of the most popular campaign offered in Digital on Kickstarter.\n\nAll Core models have already been created and will be delivered directly after the Kickstarter end, when payment is received. So no waiting more than necessary for your core files. All Stretch Goals have also been completed, but need to be tested and will be available shortly after that.\n\nDIGITAL MEDIA:\nWe strive to produce models that will print with as little support and parts as possible. Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit. Lovecraft will always try their utmost to ensure that you receive your files and we hope that you enjoy printing them as much as we have enjoyed creating them. If there are any issues please contact support@i-lovecraft.com\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end Resin machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, the files have been previously tested on Resin and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 150 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round.\n\nResin printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish, even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed, standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'. We do try to restrict the maximum size of models to 180mm sq where possible.\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered.

It contains a variety of interesting and unique adventures--featuring lots of new fey creatures, magic items, and even spells--and professionally made maps and artwork.\nInto the Fey was created with not just players but also game masters in mind. It is well-organized with individual adventures designed to be easy to reference and use at the game table. Several plot hooks are presented for each adventure, suggesting different ways a game master might introduce the quest to their players, and roleplaying guidelines are provided for important NPCs.\nIn the small lumber town of Aeredale, just south of Pelview Grove, things are not quiet and well. The lumberjacks at Fort Ravenbranch report hearing melodic music from deeper in the forest and even glimpses of small dancing shapes. Sewer cleaners speak of seeing flitting movement from the corner of their eyes, for there only to be nothing there. And farmers hear tittering laughter -- and sometimes mad cackling -- from their fields.\nNo, the inhabitants of Aeredale little suspect that the Vex'Mortem Fey have set their sights on the region. They know not that even now, Chittering Lucy Slopgrowth is positioning her wart-covered claws to squeeze the throats of Aeredale, Fort Ravenbranch, and the surrounding countryside.\nAnd only a band of brave and stalwart adventurers -- or mercenaries! -- can save them.\n Into the Fey features the following:\nQuests and Adventures. Into the Fey will contain 11 complete adventures with professionally made maps and inspiring artwork to take your players' characters from level 1 to 5. Each adventure includes everything a game master needs to run it at their table:\nQuest Point System. This new system allows a game master to run Into the Fey as a non-linear module. That is, the players don't necessarily have to play the adventures in a certain order. This system provides a way for low-level characters to tackle more challenging adventures and level up faster, and for high-level characters to complete adventures they may have skipped, but still get credit toward leveling.\nNew Fey Creatures. When I set out to craft an adventure module themed around the fey, I naturally sought out existing fey creatures. However, the fifth edition core rule books contain very few fey... But that's good news for you! It means there will be plenty of brand new fey creatures included for game masters to use and players to encounter.\nExpertly Crafted Dungeon Maps. Every good adventure needs a great dungeon map, right? That's why I've commissioned Lani from Paths of Inspiration as my Dungeon Cartographer. Have no fear of unimaginative, bland adventure maps, my friends! These maps are gorgeous, come in both player and game master versions, and are designed to aid the game master in running the game.\nStarter Town of Aeredale. Adventures and treacherous fey are all great and dandy, but you also need somewhere for characters to go on those adventures and encounter those fey, right? The town of Aeredale is a fully fleshed-out town, complete with a map, that serves as the backdrop of the adventures characters can go on.\nAeredale Region Overview. What are the chances your players are going to wander out of the town? Pretty good, right? That's why Into the Fey also fleshes out the region surrounding Aeredale and the corresponding region on the Fey Plane -- just in case players are brave (or foolish) enough to venture there. Beautiful region maps will be included, too, of course.\nRandom Encounters. Hey, what's a town or surrounding countryside without random encounters for players to blunder into? And don't worry, they are not just tables full of things that attack the characters. Instead, these random encounters actually contain a bit of a story with them and can even serve as short side quests for the group to go on.\nFaction System. Making friends and creating enemies are two things all adventuring parties are guaranteed to do, right? Into the Fey includes my faction system, complete with several factions to use, and faction favor rewards for each adventure.\nBeautiful Art. Wait, did I leave the best for last? Maybe. I have some stellar artists lined up to complete the art for Into the Fey. Trust me, their work is truly amazing! (And examples of it are scattered all about this page, too, by the way.)\nThe different products available in this Kickstarter are as follows:\nInto the Fey PDF. This includes the core material of the module plus all stretch goals, delivered as a full-color PDF.\nInto the Fey Hardcover Book. This includes all the core material of the module plus all stretch goals, delivered as a beautiful, full-color, high-durability hardcover book.\nInto the Fey Hardcover Book\nMap Pack. This includes digital image files of all the maps in the module for quick and easy use in your preferred VTT, such as Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds. You'll also get digital tokens of all the creature and NPC artwork commissioned for the module! Unlocked as one of our stretch goals, all backers at the $25 tier and above will get this for free!\nInto the Fey Draft. This includes the draft of all the core material of the module (but not stretch goals), delivered as a basic black-and-white PDF. It will contain everything a game master needs to run the module for their players, but without all the frills and fancy stuff. It will be delivered as soon as possible after the Kickstarter successfully closes so that groups can start playing right away and participate in playtesting if desired.\nWallpaper & Art Pack. This includes digital wallpaper of artwork I commission for the module. Everyone who pledges on day one of the Kickstarter gets this for FREE. Otherwise, it can be purchased later via add-on.\nTactical Tokens. A set of high-quality Tactical Tokens specially designed with the creatures featured in the module. Don't just play Into the Fey with your friends. Play it in style!\nDice Bag (KS Exclusive). This is a gorgeous, micro-suede dice bag, with my Kickstarter-exclusive DM Lair logo or my dragon-head logo--your choice!--embroidered on the exterior. This is a high-quality dice bag, designed to last.\nT-Shirt (KS Exclusive). What better way to be an ambassador of Nerd-dom than by wearing this high-quality, 100% cotton shirt? The front features my Kickstarter-exclusive DM Lair logo, and the back my signature phrase, \"I've been a dungeon master since high school.\"\nMens KS-Exclusive T-Shirt\nLadies KS-Exclusive T-Shirt\nOne-Shot Collection. Available as both PDF and printed booklet, this contains all the stand-alone adventures I've published over the years. All are well-designed and will offer hours and hours of fun for players, but they will also show my journey as a publisher, from my earliest (and slightly cringey) work to my latest (and far more professionally done).\nCover Art Digital Wallpaper. You get the beautiful cover art of Into the Fey as a high-resolution image file, perfect for wallpaper on your computer.\nCover Art Poster. Better yet, hang the cover art of Into the Fey on your wall! This poster will show all your friends how nerdy -- and awesome! -- you truly are.\nThe following will be available as add-ons via the pledge manager once the Kickstarter successfully closes:\nInto the Fey PDF - $25\nInto the Fey Hardcover Book - $40\nInto the Fey Draft - $15\nDice Bag - $35\nT-Shirt - $30\nTactical Tokens - $40\nCover Art Poster - $15\nWallpaper & Art Pack - $15\nOne-Shot Collection PDF - $10\nOne-Shot Collection Hardcover Book - $20\nThe below stretch goal map depicts available stretch goals and our progress toward unlocking them.

I create four more complete adventures for the module. \nMap Pack. A printable PDF and JPEG files of all the maps, perfect for virtual tabletop (VTT) use.\nPlayer Handouts. I create special handouts for players, including them in both the module and as a separate printable PDF.\nHalf-Page Art. I commission half-page art throughout the module.\nNew Random Potion System.

Shipping will be charged through the pledge manager once the campaign has closed and we are getting closer to shipping physical rewards out.\nThis project is customs friendly in the US, Canada, European Union, and Australia. No additional customs charges!\nBelow is a list of estimated shipping costs for the Into the Fey Hardcover book. Keep in mind that these are estimates and actual costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address, pledge level, and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA - $15\nCanada - $22\nEU - $27\nAustralia - $32\nRest of the World - $32\nWe'll ship to most places in the world. However, please note we are unable to ship physical products to these countries and regions: Baltic States, Brazil, Middle East, Russia, and South Africa, though you can order digital items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a former professional writer by trade who has been designing my own adventures for over two decades and running them for my own RPG groups, I'm well-positioned to write and design this adventure module. I also have various connections with others who have embarked on projects of this nature before and who are lending me their expertise and experience to ensure this project is a success.\n\nBelow is all the planning and preparation that I've done to mitigate risks as much as possible and ensure backers get an awesome product on time.\n\nThe adventures themselves have already been drafted, reviewed, and are undergoing a private playtest.\n\nI've already established connections with the following: the graphic designer for cover design and interior layout of the module; several artists who'll be doing interior illustrations and artwork; the artist for the dungeon maps; and the artist for the overland and town maps.\n\nThe artist working on the dungeon/adventure maps has begun work, and some are completed already.\n\nI've selected the publishing house that will be printing the physical hardcover books, and my graphic designer has worked with them before and is familiar with their requirements. This will help ensure a smooth experience once it comes time to print.\n\nI've selected and have an agreement with the company who will be creating the T-shirts and dice bags. Prototyping has already been finished, and they can begin production as soon as they have the green light.\n\nI've worked out an agreement with Tactical Tokens for the tokens that will be created, and production on those can begin, too.\n\nI've reached out to several third-party logistics companies that can handle fulfillment, and I am in the process of determining which one will best fulfill backers' shipping needs at the best price.\n\nCosts and finances. I've gotten quotes from all major parties involved in the production of the adventure module and related merchandise. Other costs and expenses have been considered. And I've both punched the numbers extensively and consulted with others to ensure I haven't overlooked something. My conclusion is that my funding goals and calculations are solid to make sure this project is a success and that I don't run into financial obstacles.\n\nFunding Goal. Why only $10,000? Isn't that kind of low? Yep, but it does cover all my baseline costs. I've structured the project so that most of the big-ticket items (namely the artwork) are baked into the stretch goals. That way I'm able to proceed with the project at that funding level. Furthermore, the costs of physical products are calculated into the pledges, and I've worked with manufacturers to avoid minimum order sizes. Thus, the project is able to be funded at a lower cost.\n\nDelivery Timeline. This is the trickiest part. I've punched the numbers extensively using timeline quotes from artists, manufacturers, and others, and I anticipate that everything should be ready for shipment by the summer of 2021. However, little things tend to crop up with projects like this and often timelines get pushed out due to these hiccups. My official goal is to have all physical rewards shipped by August 2021. (And my personal, un-official goal is to make it happen sooner.)\n\nThe Unknown. With any project of this nature, things will always come up. I've attempted to account for every variable upfront that I'm aware of and that my experienced advisors have told me of. However, new variables and unforeseen impediments are bound to crop up. And when they do, I'll just deal with them like everything else in life: step up and persevere.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Receive Updates + Purchase Add-Ons", "descp": "This pledge gets your foot in the door.

All models have been completely made by us and designed to be perfectly printable with all the most popular resin printers. \nAll models are without the base and they have a dimension to 32mm (from head to toe).\nEach model has been tested and exported as a high-quality STL file.\nTheir realization took place entirely on Zbrush. Behind each miniature there are days of work and careful study of proportions and positions, to make them as realistic as possible.\nWe are proud of what we have achieved with so much work and we hope that our dwarves can please and satisfy everyone.\nHegnar The Impetuous\n\nIgnes The Assoult\nVognar Cuthroats\nHesur Strormbearer\nBig Holin Longlook\nLittle Bolin Longlook\nSinar The Fearless\nKenus Soulstealer\nHobur The Party-boy\nRilonna Ironmind\nDoli The Smasher\nDorfas The Eldritch Knight\nFelin Fastep\nRufus Breakrock\nKinessa The Fury\nKamli The Summoner\nRargtad The Electrocutioner\nNurin The Averse\nTegnar The Bloodthirsty\n\nMalyan The Proud\nBagnar Meltiron\nDoran Grimlook\nDwari The Dynamiter\nBryna The Indomitable\nBaldur The Adventurer\nDorella Breakheart\nMifur The Stinky\nKogan The Raider\nSonus The Transmutator\nLomli Longclaw\nAll the rewards will be distributed through the MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager.\nSoon after three weeks after the end of the project, in your email linked to Kickstarter you will receive an email from MyminiFactory with a link to access the project's Pledge Manager, where you can download your rewards, upgrade your pledge and purchase any available Add-ons.\nPrinted and painted by Maria zur Nedden\nPrinted and painted by Tyson Koch\nPrinted and painted by Aaron Walker\nPrinted and painted by Yisongliu_minis\nPrinted and painted by Whitecrowstudios\nPrinted and painted by Thepaintedwookie\nPrinted and painted by Aaron Walker\nPrinted and painted by Matheus Tavares\nAre you tired of wasting hours and hours of time and work supporting your prints?  This is the tier for you!\nThe Pre-supported version of the pledges are made entirely by us on Chitubox and includes  .STL and .Chitubox files for each model , pre-supported and manually tested, so as to save you time and resin and allow that printing proceeds without ruthless problems. \nThe .STL files will allow you to print the models on any slicer and printer without having to use Chitubox. In addition to this you can easily scale the model without having to reposition the supports. In case you want to reduce the size of the model, please pay attention in removing the supports and increase the exposure times to compensate the fragility of the supports and details.\n\nThe .CHITUBOX files will allow you to make any changes you deem appropriate to the supports, without having to reposition all the supports from the beginning.\nPrinted and painted by JoshuaTheCorrupt\nEach supported model has been tested on an elegoo mars with exposure times 5/8/60 and layers from 0.03 and printed with Elegoo Gray waterwashable resin. \nWe advise you to use parameters similar to ours. The success of printing is not guaranteed as you too will have to do your part, correctly calibrating the plan and using the appropriate printing parameters. \nScale-down Test\nDimensions only refer to this model\n How far can I go in scale down the pre-supported models?\nScaling down pre-supported models is possible but a lot is up to you. You must correctly adjust the exposure time and the speed of detachment and movement of the plate.\nWe have not tested the scaling down of every single pre-supported model, if you reduce the size too much, you will probably need to reinforce some points but the existing supports make a great foundation.\nFor the tests in the photo we used an exposure time of 9s.\nDo you want to sell your prints in your online or physical store? This is the tier for you! With this tier you will have the lifetime right to sell the models of this project.\nPrinted by Excellent Minis and painted by CraftworldStudio\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nYou may not sell or distribute the 3D files.\nThe allowed changes to the model are mirrow, scale, hollow and cut of the object in parts as long as they are subsequently reassembled in the post-printing phase so as not to alter the final yield. Other types of modifications are not allowed.\nYou must credit us as the artist, and link our Instagram's page.\nIf you wish you can use our renderings or our photos of the models in your shop.\nYou cannot use the miniatures in any type of project. (such as crowdfunding projects, board games, etc.)\nYou can't make cast/molds or mass production and you can't use our models (or portion of them) to create new stuff.\n\nWe remind everyone that the commercial license is necessary to undertake any type of sale of printed models, whether this is done through an online store, through a physical store or not.\nPainted by Curro Design\nTwo weeks after the end of the project, a questionnaire will be sent to you to fill in with the details of the shop and the owners, so that it can keep track of all the stores that are authorized to sell physical copies of our models. For this purpose, the license is valid only for a single shop. Should you close or change the shop where you intend to use the license, you will have to contact us so that we can update the list accordingly.\nPrinted and painted by Theclacksmith\n\nTips and tricks:\nWe recommend washing the printed parts in ispopyl alcohol or hot water (for water-washable resin) and leaving them to soak for 5-10 minutes so as to make the supports easily removable and without leaving evident signs.\nIf the substrates seem too hard to remove, increase the treatment time in isopropyl alcohol (or water).\nFrom sketch to painting\nRemember to take care of the miniatures with UV light only after washing, drying and removing all the supports, so as to prevent them from hardening and leaving unwanted marks.\nTo print the prototypes and test the Pre-Supported files we relied on our faithful Elegoo Mars.\n\n\nLuther The King\nKing's Bust\nBryna Bearded Version\nKinessa Bearbed Version\nMalyan Bearbed Version\nRilonna Bearbed Version\nIgnes Bearbed Version\nOrdain The Insane\n\nDwana The Queen\n\nKlaus The Barrel\n\nSoldier Set 1\n\nWarbear\nWarbear Variant\nKing and Queen Mounted Version\nSoldier Set 2\nDwarf-pult\nSoldier Set 3\nSoldier Set 1-2 Helmet Version\nSoldier Set 4\nMimma The Melee Housewife\n A HEARING THANKS! \nDuring the realization of this project we were lucky enough to meet and collaborate with fantastic artists.\nPrinted by ExcellentMinis and painted by CraftwolrdStudio\nWe want to thank them from the heart, because it is also thanks to their commitment and work that this project has come this far.\n Excellent Miniatures : The first and biggest thanks goes to Dr. Stephan Wei\u00df from ExcellentMiniatures for having created all our models with his amazing Asiga printers and giving us all this great photos.

And this is done to ensure that during production and fulfillment, everything can go as smoothly as possible.\n\nThis project is not one that is just throwing ideas around, everything are ready for production. All of the photos and videos are of actual dice prototype sets. We have done our research in phase 1, and made numerous mold and design adjustment to make sure the quality of dice during mass production will be exactly the same as the prototype dice.\n\nThis is also NOT our first dice campaign. Back in 2016, we launched our very first Dice Kickstarter. However, with the pandemic and how it is impacting international shipping, there are still a lot of uncertainties surrounding shipping and potential delays. Therefore we have given ourselves plenty of leeway by dividing fulfillment in to 3 batches, but we will be doing our best to send out as much rewards as possible in the first batch to make sure as many backers as possible will get something before Christmas! \n\nI launched my very first Kickstarter campaign in 2014, and over a span of 6 years, I have successfully fulfilled 12 different campaigns.

They were launched here on Kickstarter 3 years ago! Stat Trackers are a combined initiative tracker and stat reference card for the GM all in one. You just hang them over the GM screen in initiative order and running encounters is now a snap! \nThe players see everyone in the combat, in initiative order. Friend & Foe trackers have inspiring artwork on the players' side.\nAll the stats for everyone right on the GM screen. Edited and designed to be easier to use than a traditional monster entry. Pictured here are a selection of the Friend & Foe trackers in the works!\nFRIENDS AND FOES EXPANSION BOX\n We are expanding our product line by adding hundreds of new, unique 5e compatible Monsters and NPCs in our Friends & Foes Expansion Box. Every Friends & Foes Stat Tracker comes beautifully illustrated so the players can see what they are up against! \nFriends and Foes comes with 200+ original Monster and NPCs. The GM Screen in photo features Artwork by Mike Faille, who will be creating our custom GM screen (see below).\nThe Friends & Foes Box Set comes with a 50+ page booklet giving you a summary of every Monster and NPC included in the set.

Now contains 250 Friends and Foes on the Box set!!!\n55K Stretch goal unlocked for a total of 250 Friends and Foes!\n COMPATIBILITY \nThe Friends & Foes Box Set can stand on its own in your GM toolbox, but works even better as an expansion to our existing Complete Stat Tracker Set, Character Trackers, and Blank Monster Trackers, all of which can be added on to your pledge.  \nThis expansion is fully compatible with our \"Complete Stat Tracker Set\" which we launched 3 years ago right here on Kickstarter and is still going strong. The Complete Stat Tracker Set features 317 official 5e Monster Animals and NPCs, plus 50 Character Trackers and 50 Blank Monster Trackers.*Note the Complete Set is not illustrated.\nWHAT LURKS THERE IN THE DARK?\nOriginal monsters can surprise even the most experienced, dare we say jaded, players. Quickly create unique, interesting encounters for your group using one of the hundreds of new Friends & Foes! \n\u2022 Each monster tracker is illustrated on the player's side.\n\u2022 On the GM side, all the stats for these critters are arranged in an intuitive, easy-to-use format with background information on the reverse side of every tracker!\nThe Monster Trackers in Friends & Foes cover a range of needs:\n\u2022 First, there are an array of brutes, casters, and leader types for some of the standard foes, like orcs, goblins, sahuagin, drow, etc. \n\u2022 Second, there are our own creature creations that make good stand-ins for more common critters we are not able to include (due to copyright restrictions). \n\u2022 And, finally, a host of unique, terrifying, and dangerous creatures from our own twisted minds that we think you will enjoy springing on your group! \nFriends & Foes starts with 150 Creatures and 50 NPCs but that number grows the more stretch goals we reach!\nFRIEND OR FOE?\nIncluded in the set are a large number of ready-to-go, original NPCS that can be included as either friends or foes of the party! \n\u2022 Each NPC tracker is illustrated on the player's side. \n\u2022 The GM side of the card has the stats for the NPC,  all at a glance, as well as a general description of the NPC class (ex: Swordmaster). Also included is a quick character profile matching the art on the card (ex: Swordmaster Celestria Simon). This way, you can easily insert rich, believable,  interesting, ready-to-go NPCs into your game.  \nNPC trackers in Friends & Foes come with a general description as well as a ready to use character profile for a named NPC.\nGIANT CUSTOM FILE BOX\nThis giant file box is twice the size of our Complete Stat Tracker set! It can easily hold 750 Stat Trackers with room to search through them, using the alphabetical tabs that come in every box set. Keep all your Stat Trackers organized in one place. The lid is secured with magnets and flips back and under the box so it's out of your way when gaming.  \nPLAY\n\nCUSTOM ILLUSTRATED GM SCREEN\nArtist Mike Faille is creating an original, brilliantly-illustrated GM screen with creatures and NPCs from our Friends & Foes box set. The GM side is specifically designed with Stat Trackers in mind, but can be used by any GM of 5th edition. Follow Mike's progress right here as he finishes this amazing artwork.   \nADDONS\nJust add the amount for every addon you want to your pledge level. We will confirm your order during the post-campaign survey.\nTELL ME MORE ABOUT USING STAT TRACKERS\nSimple, but super effective. You simply hang Stat Trackers over your GM screen in initiative order. The players see everyone in the encounter in turn order on their side of the screen, but the GM side of the Trackers has all the stats for everyone in the encounter. No more flipping through books or computer tabs during play! \n\u2022 Complete Stat Tracker Set (released August 2017) includes 317 official 5e monster, animal, and NPCs, plus 50 Character Trackers and 50 Blank Monster Trackers (all available as add ons to any pledge). \n\u2022 The Friends & Foes Box Set is our work in progress, and why we need you! This expansion set will include hundreds more monsters and NPCs to use on their own or with your other Stat Trackers. Every custom creature and NPC is now fully illustrated! In addition to stats, each creature includes background information and other game-related rules on the reverse side.\n WHY KICKSTARTER? \nWe are turning to the Kickstarter community to help us make this project a reality. The original content of our Friends & Foes Expansion Box Set means we needed to hire more writers, Illustrators, and editors in addition to the cost of printing and manufacturing this set. We are off to a great start and, with your help, we can make this project a reality and a go-to resource for any GM of 5th edition.\n Credits and disclaimers:\nSpecial thanks: My partner in life, love, and business--my wife Allie ;  my wonderful daughters -- Megan, Emily and Julia; my supportive parents and in-laws; my bro Joe; my spectacular gaming crew; my good friend Stefan Pokorny, Nate, Nina, and the rest of the incredibly talented staff at Dwarven Forge; Joe Manganiello for his unsolicited patronage and support; and more friends, fans, and fellow gamers than I could possibly mention by name.
