[{"backer": "David Hooper", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Switch between handheld and tripod modes (and back again) in seconds.  \nFilming yourself is not easy. You\u2019re often on the go with tons of people looking at you like you\u2019re crazy while you hold a camera in your face. You\u2019re used to the weird looks and eye rolls, but don't you wish your handheld tripod wasn\u2019t so clunky?  \nWe\u2019ve designed something better. Meet SwitchPod. \nSwitchPod is lightweight, compact, and nearly indestructible. It will save you time between shots so you can focus more on shooting and less on messing with your gear. \n\"From vlog mode to tripod mode IN SECONDS.\" - Peter McKinnon \n\"I'm never using my Gorillapod ever again.\" - Levi Allen VanderKwaak \n\"This is such a sturdy tripod... It's the only way to vlog. Seriously, it is THE tripod for vloggers.\" - Dave Altizer of Kinotika\nSwitchPod works with any camera. No more fussing with tripod mounting plates, our embedded 1/4-20\" standard tripod screw and tightening knob will help you attach any camera in seconds. \nOpens and closes quickly.  Move easily from shot to shot and waste no time setting up. Magnets help to keep the legs collapsed together while in vlogging mode, but are gentle enough that, with the flick of your wrist, you can easily switch to tripod mode.\nEasy to hold. Finger grooves allow you to grip the SwitchPod at your comfort level anywhere along the neck. If your camera is heavy, choke up. If it\u2019s light, slide down. \nNon-slip feet. Discreet, recessed feet allow you to set your camera down quietly on a surface without it sliding away.  \nQuickly attach or remove your camera. The tightening knob allows you to switch cameras swiftly while ensuring that any camera is safely attached.  \nTake it anywhere. The thin and lightweight design allows you to easily slip it into any camera bag, pocket, or fanny pack (if you\u2019re THAT cool).    \nEasily slide it into bags & pockets.\nUse a carabiner to quickly clip it anywhere.\nStrong enough to hold heavy rigs and won\u2019t sag. Despite its lightweight design, the SwitchPod is incredibly strong and made of an aluminum alloy (not plastic). It will support a heavy camera, lens, microphone, and more without breaking or slowly collapsing. \nThe SwitchPod easily holding 100 pounds (and not being crushed to death!)\nAdd your own quick release plates or ball heads. Have a bunch of tripods with the same quick release adapters? Modify the SwitchPod by adding your own quick release plate. Need a ball head? You can add that too.  \nAccessorize. Use the two \u00bc-20\" threads on the legs to add a mic, a monitor, an LED light, or your Hello Kitty keychain.\nReady to Roll. Turn your SwitchPod into a full video rig! (Note: We tried attaching a fax machine as well, but cable management was too much of a pain.) \n Weight: 11.1 oz / 315 grams\n Material: Aluminum (Alloy)\n Length in Collapsed Handle Mode: 11\" long\n Size of Handle: 1.5\" deep by 0.75\" wide\n Size in Tripod Mode: 9.75\" tall by 9.75\" wide\n Color: Black\n Two \u00bc-20 threads for accessories\n Circle pad to protect base of camera\n Patent Pending \n\u201cYou can have in any color as long as it is black.\" - Henry Ford \nNo, but really. Just black. Keepin\u2019 it discreet, keepin\u2019 it classic. We\u2019re making just one size and one color for this first batch.\nIt's even better in slow motion, right?\nWhile attending a conference in late 2017 we noticed how many YouTubers and vloggers were walking around, using an item not meant for vlogging. We\u2019d watch over and over again as people struggled to transition between holding their camera out in front of them and setting it down on a flat surface. What they were using was cumbersome, time consuming, and honestly, kinda hard to watch. \nWe thought to ourselves, \u201cThere\u2019s got to be an easier way\u201d. \nBut there wasn\u2019t. So over the next 14 months we invented SwitchPod. \nSince the initial idea, we\u2019ve spent just over a year creating and testing prototypes, getting feedback from people who vlog all the time at events like VidCon and VidSummit, and fine tuning every feature meticulously into the final matte black, metallic prototype.\nWhat started as crude sketches turned into CAD drawings. Then 3D printed models we could actually hold and eventually into working tripods.\nWe\u2019ve tried different lightweight materials, hand grip sizes, mechanisms for keeping the legs in place, knobs for attaching your camera, and more. \nHere's a sample of all the prototypes we've been working on.\nEvery detail and feature has evolved over the last year into the product we originally dreamed of creating.\nWe have completed our final design changes, selected our suppliers, have worked with the same manufacturers on our 4 final prototypes, and have our supply chain in place. \nOnce this campaign is funded we will place the order for the molds to be created and the manufacturing will begin.\nIn order to make them perfect and not rush through the process, we\u2019re estimating 4 to 5 months until final delivery, which should be August or September 2019. \nPat Flynn & Caleb Wojcik\nPat and Caleb are both entrepreneurs and have been running online businesses for over 15 years combined.\nPat Flynn is best known for his blog and podcast Smart Passive Income, where he conducts income experiments and shares the results. \nCaleb Wojcik runs a video production company and teaches creators how to make better videos through his YouTube channel and online courses. \nThey\u2019ve worked together for over 5 years, during which they\u2019ve launched online courses, digital products, books, and filmed a ton of YouTube videos. They both live in San Diego.\nIf you know someone specific or have an audience that would be interested in hearing about SwitchPod, we would love your help sharing this campaign with them. Thank you in advance!\nFor press inquiries about SwitchPod or this Kickstarter campaign please email pr@switchpod.co. Or download our media kit including photos, GIFs, videos, branding, and more below.\nThere are a bunch of people we\u2019d love to thank that helped us turn our idea for SwitchPod into a reality. \nFirst off, the team over at Prouduct. Thiefaine Magre, Richie Norton, Jase Bennett, and Cole Chamberlain. For their support, advice, expertise, and hard work from day one. Thank you.\nSecond, to all the people that saw early prototypes in person and gave us valuable feedback and recommendations. Levi VanderKwaak, Greg Farnum, Caleb Pike, Armando Ferreira, Casey Neistat, Peter McKinnon, Thomas Frank, Charli Prangley, Roberto Blake, Kitty Peters, Jason Vong, Dave Altizer, Connor McCaskill, Robert Campbell,Ben Sullins and anyone else we forgot to mention! \nThird, our own team. Jen Wojcik, thank you for all the hard work on photos and other parts of this launch. And Tim Krupa, thank you all your help with editing and for always being a sounding board for good (and bad) ideas. \nMake the switch.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are each successful business owners and are dedicated to bringing this to our backers as quickly as possible. All that being said. Sometimes things happen that are out of our control. And while we have alllll our fingers and toes crossed that the manufacturing and shipping process goes as smoothly as possible, if things do go wonky, we promise to keep you in the loop.\n\nSupply Chain Risks: We\u2019re working with an amazing engineering and manufacturing team that has brought many products to market, but things can happen, even with experts involved. Sometimes machines break. Sometimes the factory loses power. Sometimes the timeline isn\u2019t totally in our hands and things can take longer than we\u2019d hoped. \n\nShipping Risks: Weather is a thing guys. It can affect timelines. So can port closures and other uncontrollable factors. We\u2019re willing to blow up a raft with a foot pump (not our mouths, we\u2019re not savages) and paddle out to get boxes, but no promises that\u2019ll speed up the process. \n\nActs of God: We\u2019re based in San Diego.

I\u2019m Pat Flynn, and I\u2019d like to invite you to celebrate the launch of the first ever hardcover, print edition of my book Let Go.\nMost of us live life within a series of prescribed plans that help us decide what to do and where to go next.\nWe go to school. Get good grades. Get a job. Climb the corporate ladder. \nRung, after rung, after rung.\nAnd the higher up you go, the more committed you become to that path because, well\u2014you've already climbed so far, and the fall is a lot longer from up there.\nBut what happens when your plans change or you become unhappy with the path that you're on? How easy it is to change your path?\nCreating a new path in life is one of the hardest things anyone can do. I know from personal experience:\nOn June 17, 2008\u2014exactly 10 years ago\u2014I was kicked off of my own ladder. I was laid off from my dream job as an architect.\nIt was one of the worst days of my life, but looking back, it was a huge blessing in disguise.\nIt turned out to be the best thing that could ever happen to me.\nThe most amazing things in life usually happen on the other side of moments like that, moments that try to break us down. Although our lives begin to fill with fear and confusion, those moments can turn into something great\u2014absolute new beginnings, if you let it.\nNot only did my layoff allow me to explore the other options that were available to me as I started down a new path in life as an entrepreneur, but it taught me the most important call-to-action all of us need to practice in order to create purposeful change in our lives:\nTo let go.\nI had to let go of who I thought I was supposed to be\u2014the years of architecture school, my career path, and my parents' example.\nI had to let go of the fear that I wasn't qualified or skilled enough to become an entrepreneur, and I was worried about what others were going to say about me in the process.\nThis book, this campaign, is a call-to-action to anyone looking to create a new path in their life.\nYou must learn how to LET GO, because you cannot possibly start climbing a new ladder if you're still holding onto the old one.\n June 17 is my Let Go Day, and I celebrate it every single year. This being the 10-year anniversary of this special day, I wanted to do something really cool.\nThis campaign is my way of celebrating this 10-year milestone and sharing my excitement about the launch of the Special Edition of Let Go\u2014a beautifully designed coffee table book\u2014with my audience and fans.\nThe celebration includes a slate of special rewards, from incredible deals on the digital, audio, and hardcover versions of Let Go, to once-in-a-lifetime VIP experiences!\nI\u2019ve set up the campaign so that you\u2019ll find something amazing at whatever level you wish to contribute.\nYou see, this is more than just a book about my story. It\u2019s a call-to-action to YOU, an instruction manual to help you through life's tough times, and a reminder of the most important idea for anyone looking to grow: Let Go.\nYou can check out the reward tiers on the right, or scroll down to get the details of all the rewards.\nAnd for those of you who picked up a digital copy of the expanded edition of the book when it first came out in August 2017, a special THANK YOU! You\u2019re going to love the amazing print edition we\u2019ve created.\nA Beautiful Coffee Table Print Book\u2014and So Much More!\nThe version of Let Go coming out this summer is extra special. Finally, the book gets a print release. But not just that\u2014it has an elegant hardcover treatment, replete with gorgeous interior illustrations and a design I\u2019m incredibly proud of. Plus, a limited number will come in a special edition, individually numbered and signed by me. This special signature edition also comes with a customized sleeve to protect your book, too.\nIllustration treatment from artist.\nThis Kickstarter is your chance to get your hands on a copy of the expanded edition of Let Go in digital, audio, hardcover, or signature edition.\nBut this campaign is about way more than that too!\nI\u2019m opening up some of the reward tiers for a few opportunities that rarely come around\u2014including some that have never been made available to the general public.\nIn fact, a select few of the upper-tier rewards include a chance to spend some quality time with me in various ways.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing I\u2019m the most excited about: one of the reward tiers includes a VIP ticket to my first ever live conference, which will be happening in the summer of 2019. It\u2019s going to be an amazing experience, and I\u2019m making 100 tickets available via this campaign.\nI\u2019ve never done anything quite like this before, and I\u2019m so excited to share this book, and this lineup of amazing rewards with you.\nHere\u2019s a rundown of all the great stuff and experiences you can get your hands on in this campaign:\nThe digital version of Let Go (ePub, mobi, PDF)\nThe Let Go audiobook, plus bonus videos and digital mobile and desktop wallpaper\nThe print Special Edition of Let Go\nThe print Limited Signature Edition of Let Go (signed and numbered limited edition)\nAccess to Smart From Scratch, my hands-on, comprehensive online course that has already helped thousands of people develop and validate their own business ideas\nTickets to my first ever live conference in summer 2019 in beautiful San Diego, California, along with front row seats and a VIP dinner with me\nA fun group day with me in San Diego, California\nA private 60-minute one-on-one call with me via Skype or Zoom\nA virtual keynote or presentation by me to your team or group\nAn in-person keynote or presentation by me to your team or group\nA full-day one-on-one with me in San Diego\nThe Reward Details\nNow that you\u2019ve got the full scoop on all the awesome details of the campaign and rewards, I\u2019d like to tell you a little more about my story and this book\u2026\nLearning to Let Go\nLet Go is my story about overcoming adversity through a commitment to pursuing my own path, and it's a story that has been shared before, but never like this.\nI've told my story several times on podcast interviews and on TV before, but the first time I really wrote about the deep emotions that came after my layoff was in 2012 in a simple blog post. \nThe response to that post was incredible, and my audience wanted more details about what exactly happened and how I was able to survive and thrive.\nPeople were asking questions like:\nWhat did April (my fianc\u00e9e) think after she heard the news?\nHow did my parents react?\nHow did I really transition from depression to entrepreneur, and what steps did I take?\nSo, I wrote a small book\u2014the first edition of Let Go back in 2013\u2014which was simply published on Kindle. It happened to become a bestseller in a few categories on Amazon, which was an amazing thing to see.\nA few years later, I published an updated version with a lot more stories and lessons learned since becoming a successful entrepreneur\u2014because the truth is that I've had to learn to let go of even more things to continue to grow my business and raise a family, too.\nAs I once heard, \"What got you here won't get you there.\"\nThrough it all, I\u2019ve learned the power of letting go\u2014of fear, of limiting beliefs, of things that may have worked in the past but don\u2019t work anymore\u2014in order to let in growth and abundance.\nI want to help you let go of what's holding you back, and this book, and the corresponding reward levels, can help you do that.\nI'm excited to see this book and the call-to-action boldly displayed on the cover on your bookshelf or at your desk to remind you daily that you need to remember to let go in order to grow.\nI'm excited to potentially see some of you in person at my group events, or even my big first conference next year.\nAnd most of all, I'm excited to one day hear about your story, and hopefully the role that this book played in it. \nChoose the reward level that makes the best sense for you, and I can't wait to deliver this to you later this year! The campaign will help with the production costs, as we wanted this to be a higher-end piece that you can proudly display in your home or office. \nAdditionally, if you're looking to start an online business of your own one day soon, I'd suggest the \"No Brainer Level,\" which gives you access to my online course Smart from Scratch, which has a normal retail price of $247. \nYou get this book, AND the course, at the $147 pledge level, so if you're looking for help to determine what your business should be about, or how to narrow down all of your ideas to one good one you can move forward with, the \"No Brainer Level\" is the right one for you.\nThanks again. I appreciate you! Cheers!\nWhat People Have Been Saying About Let Go\n\u201cIn this world of hype and hyperbole comes an author courageous and compassionate enough to deliver authentic hope. True, Pat's story is chock-full of emotion, but it's also sprinkled with entrepreneurial lessons along the way. You'll find yourself captivated by the larger plot taking shape and you'll soon realize that your life mimics the same potential for impact. All of this begins when you're willing to LET GO.\u201d \u2014Kary Oberbrunner\n\u201cLearning to let go is a pattern on the path to success, as Pat clearly points out in his book. From comparing yourself to others to starting to act like a real CEO\u2026 this book helps me look at each letting go moment as a big win. I could really relate to all the self-doubt that even the amazing Pat Flynn experiences. Thanks for keeping it real, Pat. It's nice to know you are human just like me.\u201d \u2014Adrianne Meldrum\nAbout Pat Flynn\nPat Flynn is an acclaimed thought leader in the areas of online entrepreneurship, digital marketing, and lifestyle businesses. He overcame career adversity at an early age by finding his own path and true passion. Despite his success in business, Pat\u2019s greatest joys are spending time with his family and friends as well as helping inspire and educate others on how to succeed with their own entrepreneurial careers.\nSince 2014, however, he\u2019s become more interested in areas of philanthropy, specifically in the world of education. He is on the advisory board for Pencils of Promise, and has helped build schools in Ghana, Africa. He plans to use his success to help education locally, a passion of his now especially since his two young children are now of school age.\nPat is routinely praised for his authentic leadership style and business principles. Forbes recently named him one of the ten most transparent leaders in business. The New York Times profiled him as a case study in smart online business building. And countless podcasts and blogs have featured his story and the techniques he uses to manage and grow this audience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an online entrepreneur, I have a tremendous amount of experience seeing ambitious creative projects to fruition, including publishing print and digital books, creating multiple online courses, two successful podcasts\n\nThis campaign was not a last-minute decision; I, along with my incredible team, have been working behind the scenes on all aspects of the campaign for several months.

For us as creators, it\u2019s a word that explains how we earn a living from our work, so we\u2019re taking the word back and re-defining it with this project.\nThe Documentaries\nWhen we started this project in late 2016, the craziest thing we could think of was traveling all over the country to meet creators in their homes to tell their stories.\nOver the course of four months, we did just that as we took four trips to film 90-120 minute interviews with nine different creators across seven cities.\nWe spent the rest of the day with each creator filming their lives \u2014 from their favorite workouts, to getting the kids in bed, to making snacks for baseball practice.\nThe outcome: nine short films ranging from five to nine minutes capturing the emotional journey of making a living as a blogger.\nThe Coffee Table Book\nWhere the documentaries serve to share the emotional arc of each creator\u2019s journey, the coffee table book dives into detail to capture exactly how it all happened along the way.\nBeyond the nine creators featured in the short films, we also sat down for long-form audio interviews with eight more creators.\nWe\u2019ll tell all 17 stories in the book with engaging prose, data-driven graphics, and stunning photography.\nYou can expect to learn:\nWhy they care about their work so much \nHow they got started \nHow they built an audience \nWhen they decided to create their first product or service \nThe biggest struggles and triumphs on the way to earning a full-time living \nHow their business earns money today \nTheir biggest personal and professional lessons learned from earning a living as a creator\nBut more than anything, you can expect this book to represent why your story as a creator matters. Why being a creator - a blogger, a podcaster, a YouTuber - is one of the most fascinating and rewarding ways to earn a living today.\nThe Creators \nThis project features 17 inspiring creators spread across many different industries, skillsets, and cities. Some will be featured in the short films and written stories, while others will be featured solely in written stories.\nThese creators are:\nAsad Chaudhry - Magic - 52Kards.com \nBarron Cuadro - Men\u2019s Fashion - EffortlessGent.com \nBrooke Schoenman - World Travel - HerPackingList.com \nChad Collins - LEGO and Events - BrickFestLive.com \nCorey Willis - Interior Design - HeyThereHome.com \nCourtney Slazinik - Photography - ClickItUpaNotch.com \nCrosby Noricks - Fashion and Public Relations - PRCouture.com \nDave Stuart - Teaching - DaveStuartJr.com \nThe Fantasy Footballers - Fantasy Football - TheFantasyFootballers.com \nJean Van\u2019t Hul - Art and Parenting - artfulparent.com\nJoshua Becker - Minimalism - BecomingMinimalist.com \nKrista Stryker - Fitness - 12MinuteAthlete.com \nMique Provost - Creativity and Home Making - ThirtyHandmadeDays.com \nPatty Palmer - Art and Teaching - DeepSpaceSparkle.com \nSarah Morgan - Online Business - XOSarah.com \nTyler James - Comics - ComixTribe.com \nVanessa Levin - Pre-K Teaching - Pre-KPages.com\nA Preview of The Stories\nTo get a taste for what we\u2019ll share in the films and coffee table book, here are a few of our favorite quotes from the long-form interviews:\n\u201cMy audience is the one who told me I should have a business and I kept saying no. I was just putting content out there like bloggers do and somebody said, \"I'd pay you for that if you could send it to me as an attachment.\" \u2026 They started asking more and more and wore me down. Finally, this little light bulb went off in the back of my head and I was like, \"People would pay me for this? To do what I love? Really?\" - Vanessa Levin, helping pre-school teachers keep the kids educated and entertained\n\u201cIn order to get into [fashion] nowadays, you have to be a little bit different from everyone else. You can't just do a \"what I wore today\" blog, because there are millions of other people who are doing it. So, what is that thing that would make you a little bit different from the people who are already in the niche?\u201d - Barron Cuadro, helping men dress with confidence and style\n\u201cI remember the day I made 12 cents and I was like, \"Holy shit, you can make money doing this? Game on.\" - Corey Willis, helping you make your house feel more like home\n\u201cTeaching matters because all of human history is built on teaching. It's this constant investment in those who follow. So, teaching in the classroom matters a lot to me because it's my calling and I feel like I'm made to try to teach these kids about world history and life.\u201d - Dave Stuart, helping teachers become better teachers\nThe Team Behind the Project\nThis project is created by the team at ConvertKit, where we\u2019re on a mission to help creators earn a living.\nConvertKit is email marketing software for online creators - the authors, makers, chefs, photographers, YouTubers, teachers, artists and other creators building the future.\nEmail remains the #1 tool for building an audience and making a living online. If you believe in the importance of empowering creators to build the future, then you believe in the work we do at ConvertKit. \nWe're a remote team of 30+ people in 24+ cities across 7 countries. We hire A-players and we believe in the power of great company culture to help us grow.\nWe've partnered with the phenomenal team at Caleb Wojcik Films, who shot all of the video for this project. We also received help from our long-time writing partner, Kayla Hollatz, and a talented editor in Amanda Johnson.\nWe started this project because we believe creators are the future, we want to help tell the stories of the creators building that future, and now we need you to help us finish it. \nChoose your favorite tier and make a pledge to bring I Am a Blogger to life!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'll need to create the coffee table book and video documentaries. Both of these are already underway, and the funds from this project will help us get across the finish line. \n\nWe already have the full team in place to help edit, produce, design, and print the documentary films and coffee table book.\n\nThe biggest risk to this project would be our current print or video partners going out of business. We have contingency plans for quickly finding a new print or video partner if absolutely necessary, but we don't foresee this being an issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Join the movement", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["85 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Get early access", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["226 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Inspire a friend", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Hardcover coffee table book featuring the stories of 17 bloggers\n\"Create Every Day\" vinyl sticker\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["75 backers", "Limited (25 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 150 or more", "title": "Spread the message", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Hardcover coffee table book featuring the stories of 17 bloggers\n\"Create Every Day\" vinyl sticker\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5 backers", "Limited (10 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "Become a patron (20)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nThanked as a patron in the printed book\nThanked as a patron in the credits of all 9 documentaries\n5\u00d7 Hardcover coffee table book featuring the stories of 17 bloggers\n\"Create Every Day\" vinyl sticker\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (13 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Become a patron + meet in person (10)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nTicket to Craft + Commerce 2018\nThanked as a patron in the printed book\nThanked as a patron in the credits of all 9 documentaries\n5\u00d7 Hardcover coffee table book featuring the stories of 17 bloggers\n\"Create Every Day\" vinyl sticker\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (6 left of 10)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10,000", "title": "Screening in your city (1)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nA screening of I am a Blogger hosted in your city (US only)\nA mastermind taught by the ConvertKit team for 10 of your friends\nTicket to Craft + Commerce 2018\nThanked as a patron in the printed book\nThanked as a patron in the credits of all 9 documentaries\n5\u00d7 Hardcover coffee table book featuring the stories of 17 bloggers\n\"Create Every Day\" vinyl sticker\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (1 left of 1)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Inspire a friend (100)", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Hardcover coffee table book featuring the stories of 17 bloggers\n\"Create Every Day\" vinyl sticker\nDigital access to the book featuring 17 bloggers' stories\nFree first month of ConvertKit email marketing tool for creators\nEarly access to the video documentary series featuring 9 bloggers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Your documentary early access is here!", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\nWe did it!

If no, how can you improve?\nWhy didn't you achieve your goals?\n  Add, remove and rearrange pages any way you want using a modular disc binding system.\nRefill based on your needs: task management, goal tracking, notebook pages and more.\nTake pocket notes and add them to the notebook.\nUse the two included rulers to bookmark what\u2019s important. \n        The Perfect Notebook is a fully customizable notebook, packed with unique, highly effective, refillable productivity tools (90 pages, 180 sheets):  \n       Each add-on or refill cost is $7. Some rewards include 3 refills of your choice at a discounted price, but you will also be able to add any add-on once we send out the BackerKit survey.\n         30 seconds of your time could make the difference in growing the Perfect Notebook community. Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who could use an excellent productivity tool!\n              Why do we so often fail on the tasks that matter to us the most? This is a question asked and answered by Prof. Dan Ariely in several articles and research documents. \nWe followed Prof. Ariely\u2019s guidelines when we designed our BIG BLOCKS system, which is included in The Perfect Notebook.\nDan Ariely is a Professor of Psychology & Behavioral Economics at Duke University, as well as the author of the New York Times bestsellers Predictably Irrational, The Upside of Irrationality, The Honest Truth About Dishonesty and Pay Off. \n    The Perfect Notebook never runs out: \nBuy only ONE and keep refreshing it with our refills.\nManage weight and bulkiness: remove and archive pages you are done with, add new ones and start creating new ideas.\nOpens 360 degrees to save desk space. \nWhat could be better than a notebook you can customize to your particular sense of order?\nThe Perfect Notebook is not a planner, but a task manager. \nThe Perfect Notebook uses the daily task pages as a unique feature that allows you to incorporate \"BIG BLOCK\" tasks everyday, parallel to regular day-to-day tasks.\n  While many applications for time management exist, none can replace the added value of sitting down with a pen and paper. It\u2019s just faster, way more convenient, and therefore you will actually use it. \nHere is what Amy Schellenbaum, Popular Science, had to say:  \n\u201cWriting things down can make you feel better, mentally and physically.\u201d  \n\u201c...Once you\u2019ve written down all the tiny things you need to get done, you give your brain the capacity and the encouragement to actually do the things.\u201d  \n\u201cThe manual effort: It\u2019s easy to underestimate the swell of satisfaction from making progress on something physical. To-do lists give nerds like me the thrill of checking something off. It\u2019s a genuinely pleasurable experience.\u201d  \n   \u201cA lot of tech people I know are going back to paper, because a paper planner \u2026 there\u2019s still no better tool than a paper planner.\u201d organization and time-management guru, David Allen, said during a recent Wired.com interview.\n    Select your preferred reward tier (your card will only be charged at the end of the campaign). \nChoose the accessories and refills that fit your needs. \nAt the end of the campaign, we will send you a BackerKit survey, which will allow you to finalize your order, change reward tiers, select more than one reward tier and customize your order with add-ons. Extra shipping rates may apply, depending on your selection(s).\n    We put a lot of thought into the design of the Perfect Notebook to make sure it would be both effective and beautiful. \nColor Palette - the Perfect Notebook couldn\u2019t just use black ink. We tested many colors and shades and finally opted for a color palette which used the the classical Montblanc Leo Tolstoy ink as reference. This beautiful ink shade, printed on a thick, 90 g/gqm, cream colored paper just looks great.\n Blue color shades used across The Perfect Notebook:\nHowever, color is not just about looks. We decided to use colors as a simple and intuitive prioritization tool in the daily task pages. \nThe mechanism is simple - darker blue equals high priority. Lighter blue equals lower priority:\n        Design: Oren Fait | www.orenfait.com\nVideo: Yawaradi Studio | www.yawaradi.com\nLayout: Maia Lichtenstein\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom our experience, production and fulfillment pose the biggest challenges in a Kickstarter campaign. \nWe are working hard to make sure we fulfill the demand by producing and delivering the notebook according to schedule, so you receive your notebook on time. \nTo achieve this goal, we have teamed up with a leading printing company that will help us with production and logistics, ensuring you will get your notebook quickly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THE DIGITAL PERFECT NOTEBOOK", "descp": "You will receive a complete PDF of The Perfect Notebook at the end of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["3,234 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 34 or more", "title": "ONE PERFECT NOTEBOOK", "descp": "One Perfect Notebook including the daily task manager pages (40 sheets, 80 pages), the \u201cBig Blocks\u201d system (10 sheets, 20 pages), a ruled notepad (40 sheets, 80 pages) and two ruler bookmark.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["485 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 46 or more", "title": "ONE PERFECT PACK", "descp": "What is a perfect Pack:\n**One Perfect Notebook stacked with all the features listed above with 3 refills to keep the notebook going for longer.**\nThe Perfect Pack is our second best value reward (second only to our double perfect pack :)) with a triple refill pack you can replace in seconds to last you through next year :)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,367 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 58 or more", "title": "TWO PERFECT NOTEBOOKS", "descp": "\"Give one to a friend\" pack.\nWant to buy yourself a notebook and give one to your friend as a gift?

This project was so different for the Kickstarter community. We\u2019re not selling a product; we\u2019re sharing a big idea. \nYou responded in such a huge way. Because of your generosity and backing, we\u2019ve raised our full stage 1 goal and some good design phase funds. This is a HUGE WIN!\nTo stay updated on our journey, sign up for updates at ThePurposeHotel.com. \nWe\u2019ll keep you updated every step of the way.\n But for now, it\u2019s time to CELEBRATE!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJOIN US FOR OUR NEW CAMPAIGN!\nOver the last month, we\u2019ve shared with the world our vision for The Purpose Hotel. And we are overwhelmed with the response. Thousands and thousands of backers came together to show everyone that we can help make a change for the better.\nNew response has created a new opportunity for us. This is our new campaign and our new goal. Scroll down to \u201cnew things\u2026\u201d for all the details!\nFor those who are new to The Purpose Hotel idea, scroll down to \u201cIntroducing The Purpose Hotel\u201d and join us!\nNew things are happening with The Purpose Hotel\nWe have dissected our budget to include the minimum of what we need to launch and get this project underway. Sure, we still hope we raise as much as we can, but by creating smaller goals, we can get started faster and maintain the flexibility we need to grow at the right pace. We\u2019re launching this Kickstarter with a smaller incremental starting goal of $347,000. \nReaching our goal of $347,000 allows us to complete our initial designs for the look and feel of our building and how it will look in the city of Nashville. At a minimum, this allows us to complete a financing package that will allow us to move forward with the project. We're excited that this first step is very achievable. But we still need your help to reach that goal. We have same perks and backer benefits as before. So if you\u2019re returning, Welcome back and thank you for backing us again. If this is your first time here, Welcome and thank you! We need your help.\nIntroducing The Purpose Hotel\nI've traveled the world for the past decade as a photographer, and every time I stay at a hotel, I can't help but think -- what if everything in this hotel was connected to a cause or a need?\nCould a simple shift like that change the world? Imagine not just a hotel, but a global hotel chain, where every time you book a room: \nA child gets sponsored.\nThe internet fee fights human trafficking.\nEvery product (soap, shampoo, linens, furniture, curated art, specialty products) is purchased from partners who are making a difference. \nIn the lobby, a clean water well symbolizes the flow of hope and life to everyone and everything connected to the hotel.\nBy choosing this hotel, you touch a hundred lives or more locally and internationally. You literally change the world in your sleep.\nAnd that\u2019s just the beginning. The design reimagines the hotel as a creative, interactive experience that ignites the imagination, promotes play and fosters community.\nFrederick Buechner said, \"[Purpose is] where your deep gladness and the world's deep hunger meet.\"\nWe aim to create a joy-filled space where this generation can come together and make awesome things happen.\nIt starts right now.\nLet\u2019s make history.\n-jeremy\nAs seen in:\nWhat the Press is Saying\n   The Purpose Hotel features top-of-the-line products and materials that contribute to social good.\nAll good hotels provide a retreat \u2013 a respite \u2013 for its traveler. The Purpose Hotel goes farther: it connects you to something that\u2019s bigger.\nSimply put, people are the purpose.\nEverything in the hotel is carefully considered with how it benefits others. By backing The Purpose Hotel, you become part of a larger movement.\n1 for 100 Benefit Model\nThe goods and services that make a guest\u2019s stay comfortable and luxurious help improve the quality of life for people around the world. Our design and operations teams strive to source items that maximize the number of people who benefit from the jobs it takes to create, manufacture and fulfill them.\nA single stay doesn\u2019t give just one person hope (which would be amazing in itself). We believe one night can elevate the circumstances of 100 lives or more.\nTogether, we can build a for-profit venture that creates opportunities for these partners to not only continue their amazing work, but to multiply it.\nBuild something that changes lives\nWe can build something that changes lives and becomes a defining mark of this generation. What will we be remembered for? We can leave a legacy of purpose, hope and freedom. (Or we can be known for Pok\u00e9mon Go.)\nThe fuel behind it all will be you -- those who unite around the idea that a better way is possible.\nAnd it\u2019s going to be SO. MUCH. FUN.\nThis hotel will generate jobs and innovate opportunities for people who need it most, whether they live in the neighborhood or on the other side of the world.\nBy playing your part, you help make it all possible.\nYou may never be able to sponsor 300 children or build 40 wells or help hundreds of people escape a life of poverty or addiction.\nBut you can help us build a mechanism that can. When you back this idea, you become part of the very backbone of this movement.\nYou may never even want or have a need to stay at an actual Purpose Hotel, but you want to be part of the reason this movement exists. You want to do something tangible to fight against the injustice and sadness in the world.\nThis is it.\nBecome a co-founder\nWith your help, we can build a place where people can unite around causes we can all agree on: making sure everyone has access to clean water, education, jobs, and place to call home. We want to leave the world a better place.\nThe Purpose Hotel provides a way to secure your legacy.\nJoin this Kickstarter at the co-founder level and you become an agent of change. Your face will permanently be part of a special co-founders feature wall in every Purpose Hotel that we build, including our first in Nashville, Tennessee.\nAs a co-founder, you\u2019ll be in on every step of the process. This is just the beginning \u2013 the ground level. We\u2019re dreaming of Purpose Hotels dotting the map and eventually spanning the globe.\nLet\u2019s show the world what we can do together and build out this vision at a level never seen or imagined. We\u2019re not just building a hotel chain; we\u2019re innovating a business model that reimagines the hotel concept and allows hundreds of organizations to multiply their efforts and hundreds of thousands to fulfill their purpose -- including yours.\n  The Process of Building a Hotel on the Internet.\nWhy crowdfund? Founded on the belief that what unites us is more powerful than the boundaries that divide us, The Purpose Hotel will be built communally on the internet. We\u2019re not crowdfunding just because we need the money. We\u2019re crowdfunding because it gives you a place in the process. The idea of this hotel being built for the world, by the world is a far more beautiful narrative than the traditional for-profit launch.\nThe Purpose Hotel is a rallying point. It\u2019s a junction where community, justice, microenterprise, technology, art and design intersect.\n This hotel concept eliminates the need to agonize over which movements or causes to support. You become part of many of them.\nHere\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take (besides copious amounts of caffeine and animated cat gifs).\nCommunity managers to scout locations and rally support within cities and local communities\nAccounts team to source all the design needs and partnerships\nA design and engineering team to blueprint the building\nAn interior design team to craft a custom, boutique hotel experience\nA hotel management team to reinvent guest services\nA dedicated family of supporters to share this idea with the world\nThere\u2019s a place for everyone to get involved \u2013 starting right here. Make a difference by backing our design phase now.\nOur Guide: Jeremy Cowart\nJeremy Cowart has spent the last 10 years photographing celebrities including Sting, Britney Spears, The Kardashians, Taylor Swift and more -- and stayed in hundreds of hotels. None of them left him inspired. So he began to reimagine the modern hotel.\nAlthough he\u2019s an entrepreneur at heart, he knew this hotel idea would be an enormous and ambitious undertaking. So he began telling people, one by one \u2026 People just like you. You responded. In a BIG way.\nAnd not just you, but industry insiders, celebrities and some of the most influential business, religious and nonprofit leaders in the world.\nHe\u2019s inviting all of us into this story.\nJeremy believes that as individuals, our influence is limited, but together, we\u2019re about to see some amazing, incredible things happen...\nJeremy's Story:\n   GOALS / STEPS\nHelp us meet and exceed our goal to build a strong foundation for The Purpose Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. Here is how we'll use the funds: to design our hotel, make arrangements for our building and head toward the operations phase. This hotel will be a catalyst for change in a powerful and incredible industry that needs a breath of fresh air.\nGOAL $347,000\nRenderings / Development\nReaching our goal of $347,000 allows us to complete our initial designs for the look and feel of our building and how it will look in the city of Nashville. At a minimum, this allows us to complete a financing package that will allow us to move forward with the project. We're excited that this first step is very achievable. This step will stir excitement in our city and gain approvals for the hotel and its mark on Music City!\nGOAL $347,000 - STEP 2 \nDesign and Architectural Planning\nOur next step will be to execute the actual look and feel of the hotel's interior and exterior. Design/engineering planning will take place to discuss building efficiency and how it can be one of the most unique locations in Nashville. This design will place us on the map and turn heads as to a new standard for hotels. \nHotel Features\nEvery product in The Purpose Store will have a cause and a story -- allowing guests to purchase beautiful accessories for their home and office while knowing that they\u2019re helping families around the world improve their circumstances. The hotel will also feature:\nHallways and common areas filled with light and sound.\nRooms rich with textures and fine finishes, including one-of-a-kind handmade items.\nAn interactive TV feature where patrons can see and interact with all the organizations The Purpose Hotel is connected with. \nThe Purpose Hotel staff will have the ability to contribute and share their own stories. They will be part of the experience and ongoing motivation of what this hotel is all about.\nWhat will a guest experience look like?\nWhen you arrive and check in, you automatically become a member of the community. Your receipt and online account show your individual impact and the collective influence of people choosing The Purpose Hotel. It adds up quickly.\nUnder the room number outside your door, you see a boy or girl who your room helps gives access to education, food, clothing and more.\nInside your room, you relax in a plush, modern place where you can learn about every object in the room and why it was selected.

We\u2019ll show how your support works toward our building goals before the ground is even broken.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one that has a purpose as strong as ours. This idea has been incubated for four years. Nine months ago Jeremy began giving it legs, meeting with advisors and consultants and assembling teams to research and prepare the idea as a product for Kickstarter. Much diligence and many resources have been invested to get it to this point. However, we know a concept like this will have numerous challenges to bring it to full reality.\n\nBut here's what keeps us moving forward (and the reason we chose Kickstarter to fund the initial phase of this project): you have shown us overwhelming support. You, the community, along with industry outsiders and insiders, nonprofit partners, and leading voices from a variety of sectors continue to champion this idea and speak into it. We continually hear of ways to expand our vision beyond our first location. We have yet to hear from anyone who has a reason for us to believe this can\u2019t become reality. But we temper our optimism with caution. We know the next 2-3 years (what we\u2019re calling our studio phase) will be extremely difficult, but we are excited about assembling our \"dream team\" and taking the next necessary steps.\n\nDREAM TEAM: The aim of this Kickstarter is to fund the first year of our studio phase, when we will attempt to raise the capital funding needed to bring this project to completion. This team will bring together the best design artists, international supply and finance, and hotel operators in the industry. Our finance team members have assured us that if we secure funding for our studio phase, we can put together a finance package that can build this hotel. We have a great pool of experts surrounding us from inside and outside the industry. There\u2019s a quote attributed to Picasso that says, \u201cLearn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.\u201d That\u2019s the approach we\u2019re taking.\n\nHOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE: This is going to be a 2-3 year process to build the first hotel. We will have a lot of fun along the way and involve our co-founders in every step of the process. We're already planning an awareness tour for The Purpose Hotel, and we're hopeful to launch our Purpose Store online almost immediately, so you can see the great products we are working into the hotel and have the opportunity to help these organizations and support us along the way.\n\nSOURCING / PARTNERS: We know one of our biggest challenges will be in procuring enough goods that meet our stringent requirements to supply our ongoing operations. But we\u2019ve been encouraged in our meetings with dozens of social good and not-for-profit entities on how we may source materials and continuously ensure quality-control. We already have a first-rate Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment (FF&E) team and award-winning design team to help build the building in place.\n\nCONSTRUCTION: We are less concerned with the construction to operations phase because we have plenty of top partners who are eager to work with our project. We do have challenges finding the right property. Having funds in hand to pay cash (or mostly cash) for property will give us great leverage with owners and city planning managers.\n\nGIVING BACK: Once our project is out of the ground, and we are operating as the first Purpose Hotel, we will have more ability to generate profit and give back in a direct way (but from day one we\u2019ll source from and partner with organizations who are helping those in need). There is quite a bit of risk of getting us there. However, we believe the large support network of organizations we\u2019re partnering with will drive our operation toward reality. They\u2019ve done so much of the leg work over the years and are helping us find vendors who will supply materials in a sustainable, non-traditional and social conscious way. Together, we\u2019re working to ensure every link in the supply chain can support and grow with us.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: We will continue to refine our process during our studio phase, and strengthen our hotel operations plan. This may bring adjustments to our model, the products we offer, and even the cities we will launch hotels in, but every decision will carefully weigh how it affects others. People are the purpose. We\u2019ll never make a change for the sole purpose of boosting profits or making a name for ourselves. We\u2019ll do everything in our power to keep our partners, the people we\u2019re helping, our staff, our guests and our co-founders\u2019 best interests at the forefront. And we\u2019ll keep you, the founding members, up-to-date on exactly what and why changes were made. We believe accountability is key.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for, such as a supplier missing a deadline, a machine breaking down, a shipment getting lost or even a natural disaster. Anything can cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of delivery setbacks, we have already vetted the supply chain and ensured the delivery of products for our Kickstarter backers. We aim to begin delivering these November 2016.\n\nWe are working with experienced manufacturers who have a passion and track record for delivering excellent products. Because the products being curated for The Purpose Hotel are in limited quantities and custom batches, there will no doubt be some surprises along the way. But we\u2019re confident we can address any obstacle by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise. We\u2019re not going to sweat it. Plus, there\u2019s always the option of stress eating. Chips and guac, anyone?\n\nAny pledge amount adds critical momentum and brings us one step closer to our goal.

The amount of support, encouragement, and enthusiasm about the Volt Planner has been overwhelming. I cannot wait to get these planners in your hands and see all the incredible things you'll be able to accomplish in 2017. \nI backed the Kickstarter. What are next steps?\nThanks for your pledge! We will be sending out a survey at the close of the project to gather your shipping address. Please be on the lookout for the survey and get it back to us so we know where to ship your book! Expected ship date is the first week of December, likely sooner. We'll share more shipping info in the backer updates. \nI missed the campaign--is it too late to get a Volt Planner? \nIt's never too late! :) We have the 2017 Volt Planner available for preorder on our website. Be sure to check out the site--you might just see something else you love. \nI pledged for the digital PDF version of the planner. When will I receive it?\nWe will be sending out the PDF a couple weeks after the campaign ends. If you missed the campaign and are looking for the PDF, we will have it available for sale on our website in a couple weeks. \nI'm interested in the limited edition custom cover for the planner--is there any way to get one?\nYes! We sold out of covers so quickly on the Kickstarter but we're already making more. You can find them for sale on our website--they're not quite ready yet so be sure to check back when this page goes live (hopefully in a few weeks).  \nI really enjoyed the updates, especially the worksheets and tips & tricks. How can I get more?\nStay up-to-date with announcements, advice, and more by signing up for our newsletter. Go to our website and scroll to the bottom to sign up! \nThank you for a great campaign. Keep on shining, superstar. \nHOW WOULD IT FEEL TO ACCOMPLISH EVERY SINGLE GOAL YOU SET OUT FOR YOURSELF THIS YEAR?\nHow successful could you be if you weren't slowed down by day-to-day distractions, and started making real, tangible progress on your most important work and goals?\nIf you\u2019re tired of always feeling like you\u2019re farther behind than you want to be, and you\u2019re ready to start accomplishing the things you truly want to do to move your career and your life forward, then you need the Volt Planner.\nDesigned and delivered by the same team that brought you the incredibly popular Spark Notebook and Spark Planner, the 2017 Volt Planner takes the very best goal-setting, planning, and personal organization tools from those planners and bundles them into a full year of laser-focused amazing success and productivity. \nYou don't need to be perfect or have superpowers to be successful. You just need the right tools. Anyone can be amazing. You can be amazing.\nThe Volt Planner is sleek, professional, and designed to make you more successful. We have taken the science of setting and achieving your goals and wrapped it into one beautifully designed planner - and you won't want to start your year without it.\nWith the Volt Planner, success is always at your fingertips.\nOver the course of my career, I have worked with some of the smartest, most successful people in the world. From my time as a software engineer at big companies like Microsoft and Amazon to my time as a Chief Technology Officer at successful startups like Moz and Decide, to sitting on boards of international organizations, I have seen one thing time and time again:\nThe most successful people in the world are always organized and put together.\nThey rely on targeted goals, smart planning, and deep, focused work to accomplish amazing things. I\u2019ve learned so much about how to be amazing from these people, and now I want to share this proven system to help you be more successful too.\nTwo years ago I launched a Kickstarter to produce a goal-setting and note-taking system called the Spark Notebook. We were able to share the notebooks with people all over the world - it was amazing to create something that made so many people more successful and productive. \nHere we are today, over 30,000 books later. We've shipped to thousands of people and were overwhelmed with inspiring success stories and lots of encouragement to keep the goodness coming year after year.\nYou've got your goals--mine is to take these proven planning tools and give them to you in one planner that you can use to make 2017 your best year yet.\nResearch has shown that people who write down their goals \u2014 and who review those goals regularly \u2014 experience more success than those that don't.\nI wanted to create a place where goal-setting could be beautifully simple and powerfully effective.\nIn the Volt Planner, you\u2019ll find smart, simple, easy-to-use layouts that will help you stay on track every day, all day. This planner takes those big, complex goals and turns them into accomplishments by breaking them down into manageable tasks. After just one week, you'll feel like you're actually getting somewhere and will be one step closer to success.\nTake a look at the images below to get a feel of how beautiful (and functional) these pages are:\nYEARLY THEME & ACHIEVEMENTS\nGreat things come to those who plan for them. Lay out your great plans and big dreams, and keep a record of what you achieve and when.\nMONTHLY GOALS & 30-DAY CHALLENGES\nTrack your monthly goals and challenge yourself to create (or break) a habit. Success is *all* about consistency.\nMONTHLY CALENDARS\nMonthly calendar spreads so you can keep track of all your important dates, reminders, and appointments.\nWEEKLY GOALS & WEEKLY JOURNALING PROMPTS\nEach week there is a place to recognize your progress, learn from your mistakes, and plan how you'll keep going. And of course plenty of blank, flex space to be used for your big thoughts and grand ideas.\nWEEKLY OUTLOOK\nA weekly outlook designed for time blocking - that way you can plan your day and always know you are working on something that matters.\nHAND-CRAFTED AND ARTFULLY BOUND TO LIE FLAT NO MATTER WHAT\nEach book is put together by hand. This isn't just a planner; it's also design, a craft, a work of art. We use a special binding so the planner lies flat, no matter what page you are on.\n---\nThe Volt Planner has the following layouts:\nYearly Theme & Goals - you need to set direction\nAnnual Achievement Tracker - so you can celebrate all the great things you do next year \nMonthly Overview (12 months) \nMonthly Goals (1 for each month) \n30 Day Challenge (1 for each month) \nWeekly Goals - prioritize and strategize so all of your work matters \nWeekly Overview - designed for time blocking to help you make the most of every single day \nWeekly Inspiration Prompts - these are designed to get you thinking, but also designed to be mostly blank so you can fill them with great ideas, fantastic drawings or plans for your next big thing.\nIn addition to the useful design, you\u2019ll also discover these other great features:\nMade in the USA. I\u2019m proud to send something to you made in the country where I live. \nTwo-page markers. You\u2019ll never have to worry about losing your place. \nA luxurious and sophisticated cover. I want this planner to feel and look sophisticated so we have tested all kinds of cover materials and picked one we know you will love. \nHigh quality, ink-proof, acid-free paper. No more ink bleeding through pages. Fountain pen safe (I\u2019ve tested it myself!). \nSpecial lay-flat binding. These books are hand-sewn and designed with a very special binding that allows you to write easily on every page - front and back. \nEnvironmentally sound. We use soy based inks for printing. We use rainforest friendly paper. Everything is produced where we know the labor and manufacturing practices are to the same high standards as our products. \nOver 250 pages. We have designed each page to be clean, simple and flexible. \n 5.75\u201d x 8.25\u201d size. A perfect size for at your desk or in a meeting.\nDuring my entire career as an entrepreneur and executive, I've struggled to find a notebook that had the functionality I needed that I also wouldn't be embarrassed to carry into a board meeting.\nIt seemed like the only notebooks with goal-planners, journaling pages, and organization systems were bright pink and looked like a scrapbook. Not exactly what I was looking for to be taken seriously.\nOn the other hand, though, the sleek, modern notebooks I found lacked all functionality and served only as appointment books or calendars. They were just lined pages with no system for notes, goal-setting, or effective planning. \nThe search for the perfect, professional notebook left me wondering: Why is it so hard to find a notebook with tons of functionality and a beautiful, professional design?\nSo I built my own. I launched the Spark Notebook as a Kickstarter two years ago and the Spark Planner last year. Once the notebooks were delivered to thousands of people across the globe, feedback came pouring in.\nI heard again and again from users who wished for two things: \nA full year of pages \nFewer notes pages and more planning pages \nI listened, and that's exactly what I want to give you with the Volt Planner. Tons of functionality, a full year of amazing planning and goals, and no distractions from your biggest dreams and accomplishments.\nWith the Volt Planner, you can achieve any goal. You can make anything happen.\nAccomplishing amazing things isn't about being superhuman. It's not about being perfect. It's about having the right tools, the right system, and the right plan.\nThe Volt Planner helps you put all those things right in one place, and a place that's so artfully designed you'll want to have it with you all the time \u2014 and your coworkers will ask you where they can get one too.\nNo more wishing you could accomplish more every day, or feeling at the end of the year like you could have done more if you'd only worked harder.\nWith the Volt Planner, you can look any goal in the face and know you'll achieve it. You'll look back on every year and be amazed by what you've accomplished.\nI want you \u2014 and your ideas \u2014 to be heard. I want you to walk into your next meeting as the person everyone else wants to listen to, the person so organized and on top of things that everyone turns to you first. I want you to get more from your career and the things in life that leave you feeling accomplished and proud.\nI want you to do everything you want to do. I want you to wow your boss, coworkers, and clients with how incredibly productive and effective you are. I want you to feel proud and accomplished. And I know the Volt Planner can help you get there.\nIf you want that too \u2014 if you want to show 2017 what you're truly capable of\u2014 then please pledge now so we can build The Volt Planner and make being achieving your goals in 2017 a beautiful reality.\nThe badge below is only displayed because we were contractually required to do so.

(Click here for instructions)\nTired of telemarketers calling your landline or mobile? I'm sorry to say, they will never, ever stop. And no amount of screaming \"take me off your list\", or \"he doesn't live here\", or \"I will never buy your product\" will make these calls go away. \nBut now there is a way to fight back.  The Jolly Roger Telephone Co. provides a friendly, agreeable, patient robot that talks to these rude telemarketers for you. It is happy to chat, and will typically keep an unwary salesperson engaged for several minutes.\nThese merciless organizations have technology on their side with robotic auto-dialers, robotic soundboards, and an array of other tools ...but they have no morals. Their weak spot is that they need human agents to talk to you when you answer. So the only way to stop this intrusive industry is waste their precious human resource - to hit them in the cost of labor. Now by subscribing to the Jolly Roger Telephone Co. you can get revenge! \nIn order to accomplish this, we need to build the infrastructure to allow \"Us\" - the consumers - to fight back. We need telephone systems, we need telephone numbers, and we need to pay pretty big phone bills to the carriers.\nWe are asking for funding to build the first version of a consumer-friendly monthly service so you can take back your telephone and return to a time when your phone was for you and your friends.\nWhat will the product be?\nVersion one is a subscription service. Here's how it works:\nYou register for the service at our Jolly Roger web site and provide your email address and one or more telephone numbers you will be calling from.\nYou will be given a list of numbers for different robots (in different accents, different voices, different inane comments, male/female, etc.)\nWhen an annoying telemarketer calls you, transfer them to one of our phone numbers (your favorite Jolly Roger Telephone bot). This bot will keep your telemarketer engaged as long as it can while you continue with your fun. \nWhen the call is complete, you will automatically be emailed a link to the recording and any other information we have been able to gather about who is calling. \nYou will access the Jolly Roger Telephone web site to manage your account, review calls, download or share recordings, and a variety of other fun options.\nVersion 2 of the service will expand upon Version 1 to include the following:\nYou will be able to automatically forward your calls to Jolly Roger Telephone.\nIt will act as a call screener - automatically detecting telemarketers and sending them to your favorite robot but letting your friends and family get through to you or leave a message.\nJust like any other answering machine (\"voicemail\" to the rest of you), you will be given the opportunity to record your own voice as the voice of the robot.\nDoes your robot work really well? Share it with the Jolly Roger community and have it take calls for other telemarketers. We will maintain a leader-board of which robots are working best at wasting telemarketers time.\nEnhanced information about who the telemarketers were and what they were calling about will be made available on our web site.\nHere is a quick breakdown of how the funding will be used:\n$12k for Legal and Professional Services\n$12K to complete Development \n$22K for Operations\nWe have a prototype up and running now where you can send your calls to our bot. \nHere is what Gizmodo.com is saying about this service\nRecently featured on TheBlaze.com\nHere is what they are saying at Reddit\nEven our friends Down Under get annoying telemarketer calls (Sydney Morning Herald)\nPlease visit our Facebook page\nVisit our YouTube channel to hear our bot in action", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any innovative technology project there are potential difficulties with scaling service offerings in a reliable and expedient manner, so we do expect to work hard to build and scale the infrastructure.\n\nOur major risk is that at some point the established business interests in the Outbound Telemarketing industry notice the impact of our offerings and begin to fight back either by technical or legal means.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Roger Anderson\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nRoger Anderson is a telecommunications consultant in Los Angeles, CA.

Not exactly what I was looking for to be taken seriously.\nOn the other hand, though, the sleek, modern notebooks I found lacked all functionality and served only as appointment books or calendars. They were just lined pages no system for notes from plans from goals.\nThe search for the perfect, professional notebook left me wondering: Why is it so hard to find a notebook with tons of functionality and a beautiful, professional design?\n\nSo I built my own. I launched the Spark Notebook as a Kickstarter last year. Once the notebooks were delivered to thousands of people across the globe, feedback came pouring in.\nI heard again and again from users who wished for two things:\nA full year of pages\nFewer notes pages and more planning pages\nI listened, and that's exactly what I want to give you with the Spark Planner. Tons of functionality, a full year of amazing planning and goals, and no distractions from your biggest dreams and accomplishments.\n\nYOU WANT A SPARK PLANNER. PLEDGE NOW TO GET YOURS!\nWith the Spark Planner, you can achieve any goal. You can make anything happen.\nAccomplishing amazing things isn't about being superhuman. It's not about being perfect. It's about having the right tools, the right system, and the right plan.\nThe Spark Planner helps you put all those things right in one place, and a place that's so artfully designed you'll want to have it with you all the time \u2014 and your coworkers will ask you where they can get one too.\nNo more wishing you could accomplish more every day, or feeling at the end of the year like you could have done more if you'd only worked harder.\nWith the Spark Planner, you can look any goal in the face and know you'll achieve it. You'll look back on every year and be amazed by what you've accomplished. \nI want you \u2014 and your ideas \u2014 to be heard. I want you to walk into your next meeting as the person everyone else wants to listen to, the person so organized and on top of things that everyone turns to you first. I want you to get more from your career and the time you spend at work.\nI want you to do everything you want to do.

The good news is - I've done this before. \n\nI have been working with my printers for months to get the best possible materials and most timely shipping methods possible for these products.\n\nI want you to have this planner to kick off 2016, so you can start the new year on the right track. The biggest risk for us, then, is that your notebook might be late.\n\nProblems may come up (they always do...) but the vendors I am working with have a history of producing quality products on time. It's their job, and they do it well.\n\nI guarantee you will get your planners, and I will do everything in my power (up to and including hopping on a plane and heading to the printer myself) to get yours to you on time so you can start using them as soon as possible. \n\nI can back up what I say here \u2014 when my Kickstarter for the Spark Notebook was delayed at the fulfillment center, I had all 5,000 notebooks shipped to my house, where I packed and mailed them myself. And I'm prepared to do it again, if I have to. I am committed to getting these planners and notebooks out to all of my customers on time.\n\nIf problems do come up or you aren\u2019t happy with your planner, I promise to do everything I can to make it right. I want you to love your notebook, and if you don\u2019t, I want to fix that.\n\nI am committed to being transparent and open during this whole process.

Please read our Frequently Asked Questions at the bottom of the Kickstarter or our website. If you still have a question you may contact us via our website.\n\u201cWhat the heck am I doing with my life?\u201d This was the question I asked myself while caught in a period of directionless floating. In 2013, I had just graduated from UCLA, and I had no idea what I wanted to do next. After a dark period of depression, I realized I wasn\u2019t the only person facing this problem. I knew something needed to change. Life was too short to keep thinking \u201cwhat if.\u201d\nI thought about what was the most productive and fulfilling times in my life, and I realized I always had a trusty sidekick, my planner. I searched from the perfect planner, but it didn\u2019t exist. So, I made my own.\nI designed a planner that not only helps you plan your daily life, but also helps you define and chase what you want out of life.\nWe launched it on Kickstarter, and it became a viral phenomenon. In what felt like overnight, I went from working in my parents' garage, to a warehouse with a full staff.\nWhy another Kickstarter?\nI started this company wanting to give the world a tool that I wish existed when I was feeling lost. \nFrom day one, we have offered the PDF for anyone to use for free; we launched our Pay-it-Forward program, a program that allows people pay a planner forward to a stranger in need at half the cost; and we've given thousands of Passion Planners to 84 non-profits all around the country.\nBut we want to do more.\nNow, on our two year anniversary, Passion Planner is taking one of our biggest steps forward. Today, through Kickstarter, we are becoming a Get-1-Give-1 Company.\nEvery time you purchase a Passion Planner we are going to give one to someone in need. When you invest in yourself, you will also be investing in the dreams of someone else.\nHere\u2019s to helping more people, together.\nQuestions?

I reordered one classic planner again this year but don't understand why it went through kick starter again instead of a Passion Planner company website? I find the terminology used for the ordering process really confusing and wonder if it's a kick starter thing or not. First, why is the survey called a \"survey\" when it's really just shipping information that we're giving? If it were a survey it would be done AFTER the item is received as opposed to before. I know personally, I didn't order the academic planners this year because both of the people I bought them for said that the print was hard to read and the planning space was too small to write in. I left a message about this last year but never received any indication whether the message was received or if changes were going to be made to the product (if others had similar issues). The other phrase often used, which confuses the heck out of me, is \"Reward\", when referring to the planner that we ordered! How is it a reward, when we're paying for it?? Why isn't it just an \"order\"???

The wallet now sales on our website at www.basicswallet.com. Check it out! We are excited to introduce the 2nd product in the Basics family, the BASICS Notebook!\nWhen discussing this idea with friends and family we were often asked, \"Why a Notebook? Isn't that a step backward in technology?\". To this question we responded that the notebook is not a step back, but instead a tool to be used in tandem with modern technology to keep your life moving forward in the right direction.\nSo Why a Notebook?\n During our first Kickstarter, we noticed very quickly that our notebooks were crucial for accomplishing goals, tasks, notes from business meetings, drawing prototype ideas, brainstorming, and to just keep the project moving forward. It was nice to have everything in one place and be able to have access to it anywhere and anytime. However, with all of the notebooks we went through we couldn\u2019t find one that accomplished everything we needed and covered every aspect of our lives. One notebook that would allow us to plan, set goals, provided pages for notes, and blank pages for drawing and sketching. \n We developed different layouts that we tested on our own and then passed on to others for feedback. After receiving feedback we finalized the design and have loved what we have come up with, and we know you will too. \n It has been interesting to see what we have been able to accomplish by setting goals and taking action. We have all been taught this principle before\u2026 \"You will never succeed if you don\u2019t try\". Making your dreams into realities requires that you take that first step of setting goals and making plans. What better way to do this than with a pen and paper? \n To us, there is no replacement to the feeling of planning, brain storming and taking notes, with a good old fashion pen and paper. However there is nothing old fashioned about this notebook. We have countless innovations and page layouts that will both simplify and improve your life. Lets take a Look!\n             Share Our Project and Get a Free PDF Copy of Our Monthly and Weekly Layout!  Here's How it Works:\nWe want to spread the word so that The BASICS Notebook can help as many people as possible.  In order to get your free PDF copy, click the green button below to follow these two simple steps:\nThanks for your support!  We will email your free PDF within 2 weeks of our Kickstarter Campaign end date.  If you also want to purchase the actual notebook, check out the innovative features below and select a reward level above.\n Thanks to everyone's support we are able to make the notebook even better! Here are some stretch goals that we will apply to each reward level if we hit the specified funding goal! Help us spread the word and hit these funding goals so that we can make this an even better Notebook!\n Grid Dot Paper - We will add a new option on each reward level for a black notebook in the 12 and 6 month version that replaces the lined paper for grid dot paper. (Only available in black). \nPen - We will include one pen for each notebook. \nNew Color - Every new color requires a very large quantity to be purchased but if we hit $500k, then we will introduce a new color based on feedback we receive. If we hit $500k we will send out a survey to ask for your color choice.\n Perforated Pages - We will perforate the last 15 pages of the lined paper section and the last 5 pages of the blank page section.\nThe BASICS Notebook is hard cover and made of a high quality faux leather that just gets better over time. The notebook is available in two colors, black and mint, giving both men and women the option to choose whatever color they like best. We have used a high grade thick elastic to hold your notebook closed. You're going to love the way this notebook feels.\nPen Holder\nHow many times have you thought, \"I should write that down, no, I can remember\" and one hour later poof... Its gone. Now you can capture inspiration and important thoughts in the moment, and never be lost without the tools you need to write it down. \nBy lowering the height of the pages in the notebook by just 0.3\" inches, we have created the perfect place to securely store your pen or pencil.\nThe Pen Stored in the Notebook\nDouble Elastics\nThe first dual elastic notebook of its kind: \nThe thicker elastic is designed to hold the notebook shut, and it also holds the pen in place as explained above. \n The thinner elastic is designed to be used as a bookmark in the calendar so that you can easily turn to the right page every time you open the notebook. \nThese elastics also work together to help the notebook stay open. Perfect for reading, typing, or on windy days.\nLays Flat\nWhile the elastics help, we have designed our notebook so that it lays flat without the aid of the elastics.\nBack Pocket\nWe have added a pocket on the inside of the back cover allowing you to store important papers and documents. Each notebook will come with 2 pages of whiteboard paper (see feature below), which will be placed in this pocket to give you room to do some brainstorming. A great place for creative thinking.\nWhite Board Pages\nWhen working in groups, drawing, or if you just have something that you want to jot down, you can use the 2 whiteboard pages found in the back pocket of the notebook and easily erase everything when you are ready to move onto the next brainstorming session.\n While all of the exterior features of the notebook simplify your life, it's the inside of the notebook that is really going to help improve your life.\nWe have designed The BASICS Notebook with the best materials inside and out. Inside the notebook we used eco-friendly 80g ivory paper. The notebook comes available in two options, a 12 month and 6 month planner.  Here is a breakdown of what is in each of these two options followed by the quantity of pages in each layout:\nEach notebook has a total of 220 pages, giving you a notebook thickness that is comfortable and convenient.  Below you will see the number of each type of pages in each of these two options, the 12 month and 6 month notebooks:\n Pricing\nBoth the 12 and 6 month notebooks are sold at the same price.  Once the Kickstarter Campaign ends we will send out a survey asking you which type of notebook you would like.  If you pledge at the one notebook level you will be able to choose the 12 or 6 month planner.  If you buy any reward level that offers multiple notebooks you will be able to choose any combination of 12 month or 6 month notebooks you want.\nHere is a rundown of what the monthly and weekly layouts look like and how they can be used. Find the colored section you are curious about in the monthly and weekly layout sections below and read the corresponding description below the image.\nClick the link below to see a digital copy of the 6 month notebook:\nClick the link above to see a digital copy of the 6 month notebook\nMonthly Layout:\nA ) 3 Daily Tasks \u2013 Fill out three things you want to do on a daily basis and check the box each day that you do that activity (i.e. exercising, personal study, planning, etc...). This will give you visibility on how well you are performing these tasks on a daily and monthly basis.\nB ) Notes \u2013 Two notes sections are provided for you to use however you want. There is always something that needs to be written down.\nC ) Monthly Focus \u2013 Select something that you would like to focus on this month in order to improve (i.e. budgeting, meeting new people, eating healthy, or any other positive activity).\nD ) Monthly Calendar \u2013 We have given you an open calendar where you can add any dates you want. This gives you the flexibility to use the calendar whenever you want rather than having a notebook that will expire. Here you can get a big picture view of your entire month, and never miss another meeting, appointment, or party. We will provide a yearly calendar with the notebook so that you have easy access to the dates anywhere you have your notebook. \nE ) Goals ---> Tasks \u2013 Here we have provided room to write down your 3 most pressing goals for the month. Then connected to each goal are three lines to list three smaller tasks that will need to be completed in order to achieve that goal. This activity forces you to break down big daunting goals into smaller and more digestible tasks to ensure that you know what to do on a weekly basis to accomplish your goals.\nWeekly Layout:\nA ) Notes \u2013 Two notes sections are provided for you to use however you want. There is always something that needs to be written down.\nB ) Weekly Layout \u2013 The weekly layout gives you an hourly break down of the 7 days of the week with 1 line for each hour between 6am - 10pm. For early morning, lunch, or late night activities, we have added an extra blank space before 6am, right after 12pm, and right after 10pm. Assign these hours to fit your needs. Just like with the monthly calendar, we have given you an open weekly calendar where you can add any dates you want. This gives you the flexibility to use the calendar whenever you want rather than having a notebook that will expire. We will provide a yearly calendar with the notebook so that you have easy access to the dates anywhere you have your notebook.\nC ) Activity \u2013 Research has shown that happy and positive people are more productive, have higher income, demonstrate superior performance, and overall are more successful. So let\u2019s focus on this and create opportunities to foster a more positive outlook on life. Each week you will find a new optional activity that will help you become more positive and optimistic in your day to day tasks. Which in turn will make you more successful.\nD ) Daily Priorities (Checklists) \u2013 Jot down your most important to-do\u2019s for the day here and check them off to ensure you don\u2019t forget anything.\nE ) Goals ---> Tasks \u2013 This is the same exercise as shown in letter \u201cE\u201d in the monthly layout above, but gives you the space to make weekly goals. This activity forces you to break down big daunting goals into smaller and more digestible tasks to ensure that you know what to do on a daily basis to accomplish your goals. Again taking your big picture goals and dreams and helping you turn them into smaller actionable tasks.\nWe collaborated with Kirk Wilkinson, author of \"The Happiness Factor\" and \"I Am Strong\" to create 30 unique activities to boost positivity and increase productivity. \nResearchers have found that people who have a consistent practice of expressing gratitude report having more intense and frequent positive emotions. Grateful people have more energy, are more productive, are healthier, handle change better, report feeling hopeful and more empathetic, are less materialistic and are more forgiving. \n Expressing gratitude brings additional benefits of creating stronger relationships, the ability to deal with difficult situations and trauma better, reduces the need to compare yourself with others and allows you to see to good in others and the good around you. Gratitude can change your life!\n \u201cGratitude is a potent cure-all for negative emotions,\u201d Says Kirk Wilkinson a world-renowned expert in personal happiness and personal development and bestselling author of two books:The Happiness Factor: How to be Happy no Matter What! and I Am Strong: The Formula to Improve your Self-Worth. \nHere are examples of 2 of the 30 unique activities that will be found on the weekly layouts:\nTake a picture of something you are grateful for and post that picture to social media explaining why you are grateful.\nWrite a hand written note to someone who has made a positive difference in your life and deliver it to the person.\nGet a jump start on your own personal happiness with Kirk Wilkinson and develop the practice of expressing gratitude by downloading The Happiness Factor iPhone App by texting \u2018happy\u2019 to 878787 or Click here.

My name is Marcus Whitney.\nThis book and the company I have just founded to bring it to you (more on that below) is brought to you in partnership with the creative team at Mountain. You'll notice they are hosting this Kickstarter as well.\nThere are three things Create and Orchestrate will do for its reader:\nThe reader who lacks the courage necessary to start and run a business will be greatly encouraged, and learn why the entrepreneur is a vital role in our society. \n The reader who doesn\u2019t understand how to be a founder will become clear on the principles and practices a founder should have to be a strong leader. \n The reader who has never started or run a business will become aware of what to do when starting and running a business. I want Create and Orchestrate to re-ignite a fire in America, the idea that innovation and enterprise will come from everywhere in this country. \nWhat we need is more shots on goal. And while business books are continually being written for the initiated few, I am writing this one for the uninitiated many.\nHere is what you can expect to find in this book:\nThe simple way to embrace the mindset of a founder. \n Stories from many unlikely entrepreneurs who bucked the odds and as a result did well for themselves and their community. \nThe straight-forward blueprint for going from an idea to an operating business. \nA discussion (since there is no one right way) about the different approaches to growing your team and your business. \nA true demystification of business finance and operations (the thing that most of us get hung up on).\nI believe that:\nEntrepreneurship is a mindset and a way of doing things that everyone can learn. It is a skill, like swimming. Even though some people have more natural ability in it, the mindset and way of doing can be taught. \nEntrepreneurship can help you solve problems that traditional approaches can not. \nThrough entrepreneurship, you can beat the odds of economic immobility for your family AND make a positive impact in your community. \nBecause of these beliefs, and my first hand experience both being an entrepreneur and mentoring over 100 entrepreneurs, I'm writing a book to help develop a new wave of unlikely entrepreneurs, in hopes that they will mobilize in their communities and provide innovative solutions to the most pressing issues we face. \nThe issue I'm addressing is Income Inequality. I want to help more people make more money and control more of their time so they can be better wives, husbands, mothers, fathers and members of their communities. \nHelp me do that by pre-ordering Create and Orchestrate. \nThank you so much for your support of Create and Orchestrate and The Unlikely Company. We hit our first goal, which pushes us forward on creating the book. We are now looking to fund our first initiative. As you know, I want to create 1000 unlikely entrepreneurs. I believe this will happen through a variety of efforts. I believe Create and Orchestrate will create many of them, but I also believe that grassroots efforts in our communities will be key to this goal as well. To that end, I am partnering with the Oasis Center in Nashville to launch an after school, social enterprise accelerator program called Oasis Venture.\nThis program will teach 20 high school students how to launch a social enterprise so that they can address the needs of their community sustainably. They also will be learning the basics of being an entrepreneur which will be a life skill they can use in many more endeavors throughout their lives.\nThis program will cost around $45K at a base. I am hoping to provide $30K of this funding from The Unlikely Company as part of our double bottom line commitment. If we can get to $100K in pledges than we can do that. The big number I want to see grow from here is the number of pledges.\nLet's get 1000 pledges in the next 20 days. I know we can do it. Thanks for all your support and belief.\n- Marcus\nMy name is Marcus Whitney, and I want to make the world a better place by developing \u201cthe unlikely entrepreneurs.\u201d\nMy job as President of Jumpstart Foundry is to predictably launch successful startups in the Healthcare industry by educating, mentoring and investing in entrepreneurs. As a serial entrepreneur myself, I\u2019ve been involved in the creation of almost 60 businesses over the last 5 years. This all started because in 2007 I left Emma Email Marketing where I led technology to start a business. Once I was on my own, I found out just how much I didn\u2019t know about starting a business.\nOut of pure stubbornness, I pushed through failure after failure until I developed a solid understanding of what it takes to launch and sustain a business. On my journey, I became fortunate to become known in some circles as someone who can mentor beginner entrepreneurs. In speaking with these founders, I found they usually were in need of two things:\na mindset that would give them the courage needed to be bold, and to endure during the inevitable tough times ahead. \n a comprehensive base of knowledge about how a business operates and how you get one started\nThen I started to look a bit deeper into who was reaching out to me and why. Yes, they were looking for mentorship and yes, I do that for a living. But a pattern emerged for me last year. Many people were coming to me to hear my story, not just to hear me tell them what to do. And I think part of why they were coming to hear my story is that it was kind of \u2018unlikely\u2019 that a guy like me (African American, college drop out) would be in the position I\u2019m in.\nLeading technology teams and making venture capital investment decisions aren\u2019t typically things done by people like me. In fact, it\u2019s not just me, the majority of people in America don\u2019t actually fit the profile of today\u2019s innovative entrepreneur. That is a big problem, and here\u2019s why.\nThe accumulation and concentration of wealth in America happens in three primary ways:\nInheritance, Investment and Entrepreneurship\nJust check the Forbes top 25 richest Americans and you\u2019ll see that this is how most of them got there. And the vast majority of new entrants come as entrepreneurs. Gates, Zuckerberg, Page, Ellison, Bloomberg, Brin, Bezos & Dell. All mega powerful, all entrepreneurs. Also, all very similar demographically.\nAs the lower class, women, minorities, new Americans and others seek to balance the scales of power and representation in America, the most powerful approach available to them (us) is entrepreneurship. Yet that is not what we are being encouraged to do. I am working to change that.\nI learned about the power of entrepreneurship from my mother.\nShe didn\u2019t become rich from the business she started while I was in middle school and high school, but she did control her time, hire her friends and made sure that her work supported her life and not the other way around. I was lucky to have her show me that I could control my life and realize my dreams through entrepreneurship. For many, they don\u2019t have those examples.\nI learned after I gave my TEDxNashville Talk on Hustling, that people can draw inspiration from the stories of others, even stories from people like me. I was rocked when person after person told me that this talk had changed their life, and that they were believing in themselves in a way they hadn\u2019t done before. I learned that I could make an impact just by sharing my story and what I\u2019ve learned.\nAnd two years later, after more keynotes, more failures, and some successes, I\u2019ve seen little change in the world overall. Except, the gap between the haves and the have-nots is bigger than ever. The examples of diverse entrepreneurs are still few and far between with very few new entrants. And the impact of wealth on our most critical systems like politics, education and criminal justice, continues to tip things in favor of the rich.\nOk, fine.\nIt\u2019s time to help the rest of us focus on getting rich then. The unlikely ones.\nYou might be an \u2018unlikely\u2019 entrepreneur if:\nyou are ambitious you are creative you are a little bit of a REBEL\nand\u2026\nyou are in the lower, to lower-middle class or you are a woman or minority or you didn\u2019t finish college (or maybe even high school)\nIf so, listen up. I\u2019m starting a new company dedicated to helping you become an entrepreneur. Unlike many people in the startup space who are saying there are too many entrepreneurs, I couldn\u2019t disagree more. \nWe need more entrepreneurs.\nWe need more artists to become entrepreneurs. \nWe need more activists to become entrepreneurs. \nWe need more educators to become entrepreneurs. \nWe need more people who love people and want to help people to become entrepreneurs.\nThat is why I, with my mother Isabel Whitney, have launched The Unlikely Company, PBC.\nYou may not have seen a company before that has PBC at the end. PBC stands for Public Benefit Corporation. What this basically means is that even though The Unlikely Company is a for profit corporation (S Corp to the IRS), it is in our charter that we exist for the purpose of providing a public benefit or public good. I believe in this structure for companies seeking to do good in the world because it means the company can maintain a profit motive for its own sustainability (as opposed to dependence on donations), but is committed to doing good at its foundation.\nThe Unlikely Company exists to develop, mentor and eventually invest in the Unlikely Entrepreneurs.\nWe are committed to transparency and at present, our business model is to commit 30% of our net profits to initiatives that will achieve our mission. You can learn more about our business model here.\nOur first product is why you are here.\nI want to write the book that gets you at least 80% of the way there. The book that I wish I had when I got started. A book where I could look inside and read stories about people who I could identify with. A book that turns a steep learning curve into a bunny hill. A book with wisdom, inspiration and simple guidance on how to start and run a business. And, a book that speaks to you as the founder, about your important role in this process.\nI want to bring you, Create and Orchestrate.\nI have become overwhelmed by how convoluted the topic of entrepreneurship has become. What I believe is needed are stories that will resonate and stick with people, as well as simple and clear directions on a very complicated topic. \nI expect to have to spend time, money and other resources to gather the stories and do the research necessary for this book to make an impact. Also, there will be production costs, design, editing etc. It's going to be my first book and I want to make it worth the time you would invest in reading it. \nSo, let's go a little deeper. \nThis is a pre-order for a book. If we hit the goal, I'm gonna do everything in my power to deliver that book. However, as a pre-order, I'm going to handle the money as I would with any purchase made through The Unlikely Company. Rather than allocate a dollar amount (because I want to go way beyond this goal), I'll share how the money will be allocated. The more money raised, the better the end product will be.\nI will invest 20% of the money for travel expenses to capture stories and information for the book. \nAnother 20% will go to Mountain who is managing all aspects of my marketing, multi-media production, design and my primary collaborator on strategy. They also are managing the fulfillment of rewards, so they are pretty important.\n30% will fund The Unlikely Company's operations. That's mostly my time and our operating costs. \nAnd the final 30% will be directed towards The Unlikely Company's commitment to Public Good. Our direct impact. \n30% of The Unlikely Company's net profits go to public good. Our first initiative will set out to develop Unlikely Social Entrepreneurs in Nashville. Average age: 16 years old. \nWe are thrilled to partner with the Oasis Center in Nashville to launch \"Oasis Venture\", an after-school social enterprise accelerator for Nashville's most vulnerable and disconnected youth. We believe introducing entrepreneurship to children during their high school years, as well as the principles of Social Enterprise, will be an empowering experience for all. \nWe also believe that there is the potential for true innovation to emerge from this program that can take root in Nashville's most challenged neighborhoods. \nSTRETCH GOAL:\nWhile Oasis Center is seeking funding along side of The Unlikely Company's commitment, we would like to fully fund the venture as soon as possible. The program will require ~$40K to operate. So our super stretch goal is to hit $100K in this campaign so that we can commit $30K to fund the program. \nNOTE: $30K is more than 30% net profit on $100K revenue (net profit means what's left after we pay all the bills) , but if we hit the stretch goal we will go beyond our normal double bottom line commitment. \nIn the first reward level, you'll find access to the E-book, the first print edition, custom Create And Orchestrate merchandise and updates from me not only during the campaign, but during the process of further researching and writing the book itself.\nThe Create and Orchestrate brand (as well as my new personal brand and The Unlikely Company brand) were designed by the ultra talented Stephen Jones. Stephen is an entrepreneur that I admire because of his commitment to integrity in every thing he designs. He absolutely nailed our brands and we are proud to offer a limited edition T-Shirt for our community to represent our mission in the world.\nThe sold out crowd at CHARGE 2014 in Nashville.\nIn level 2, I'm including ways backers can also get engaged in the annual conference I produce with Jumpstart Foundry and Mountain called CHARGE. CHARGE is all about the story. Last year's kick off event in Nashville sold out and we heard seven incredible, authentic backstories from entrepreneurs of all types.\nJeni Britton Bauer explain how she built an Ice Cream empire and stayed true to herself. We heard James Ellis from Athletics explain how not knowing what you're doing at first is just fine. The important part is that you decide to do it anyway. We heard from Clint Smith on how he built Emma and how Bailey Spaulding is growing a unique brewery in Nashville. We heard quite a bit more as well.\nThis year, CHARGE is already looking to be bigger and better. It will sell out again, no doubt. At this backer level you can secure a spot at the November 2016 event. You can also secure a very limited VIP pass which includes a night before dinner with myself, Jumpstart Foundry, Mountain and any available speakers. \nI strongly urge you to engage at this level. There is nothing like learning from these stories first hand.\nMe introducing a speaker at CHARGE in 2014\nAt our final backer level, I'm offering not only the first edition of Create And Orchestrate but a couple options for a one-on-one experience with me. These range from a 30 minute Skype conference to a full day, in person strategy and design session with me. I'll even fly to you if you're not near me (as long as you are in the US)! \nIf you're idea or your company is at the right place for this kind of in-depth face to face help, then these rewards are for you.\nFirst, thanks to you for making it all the way to this part of the story :) That was a lot to read! \nI appreciate you, and I thank you for your pledge. This is a work of passion and conviction, a calling. Your pledge is vital to my ability to do this, far beyond money. It's confirmation and validation. So thank you. \nThank you to the Unlikely ones who trudge ahead in this world in spite of all the odds against you. You are inspiration enough for me to do all I can to support you. Hell, I'm one of you. \nNow, for the team. \nI can not and did not do this alone. \nI want to thank my family. My parents, Isabel and John who relentlessly and irrationally support and encourage me to do anything I want to do. I'm glad we are finally partnering on a venture together!\nThank you to my wife, Rachel. You literally brought me back to life when we met and everyday with you is a blessing. Best Partner Ever. I love you. \nThank you to my kids, I'm sorry I have to spend so much time working. I love you both and just about everything I do has you in mind. You're growing up to be great, young men. \nThank you to my best friends in the world, RO5 and NPHI. Y'all are my backbone everyday. \nAnd to all my friends for all your love and support. Especially with the delay of this launch, you have all been so amazing. \nThank you to Vic Gatto and the entire Jumpstart Foundry team for your confidence in me to do this and still be your President. Best Team Ever. \nThank you to Mark and Tom with Oasis Center. I'm thrilled to be partnered with you. \nThank you to the Nashville EC and the Social Enterprise Alliance for your support. \nThank you Leadership Nashville, Future Ready Nashville and Young American Leaders Program for transforming me over the last 12 months. \nThank you Make It Pop for your masterful work and bringing my idea to life. \nThank you Stephen Jones for being such a giving, amazing friend. You made all this look so damn good. Glad we could partner on this and hope to partner more in the future. \nThank you to Mountain. You crazy, ambitious, creative rebels. Keep Being Awesome.\nAnd finally, thank you Jacob Jones. You are one badass MF. Literally, none of this happens without you so thank you for your friendship, commitment and your belief in me.

It was a pretty wild ride from start to finish (might even make a good book someday), and we all went our separate ways doing a wide variety of projects and vocations, reuniting occasionally in the 90s to bash it around a bit more.\nLast Promo Shot of Band, 1991\nBut, unlike so many groups who have been through similar experiences, we have stayed close friends ever since, And when circumstances brought Ross Rice (vocals, keyboards, lyrics) back to Nashville in late 2014 where the other band members Kye Kennedy (guitar, vocals), Peter Hyrka (violin, guitar, vocals), Steve Arnold (bass, vocals), and Steve Ebe (drums, vocals) resided, there was simply no good reason not to continue the musical conversation started over 20 years before.\nWe started hanging out again, created new tunes generated from just playing together again. There is an undeniable chemistry afoot here. And now we are thinking....well, let's record it, get it out there somehow. And lo and behold, here is the beautiful new concept of \"crowdfunding.\"\nSo we are asking for your donation, and here is what we intend to do with the money. We have started the project already out of pocket....we will use this money to pay for studio time to complete overdubs, mix and master the final product, pay for a CD and vinyl run with artwork and booklet, and all shipping and postage getting them to donors and press/radio.\nAfter that, we hope to use additional funds to finish building our website, and then we want to secure a suitable venue for an evening, get a bunch of cool lights, a good sound system, and a roomful of good friends, and live record a series of videos in either Memphis or Nashville (possibly both.)\nThe budget we have worked out covers the expenses for all of this, with just a little padding. Additional funds will go to helping us get the music further out, to help the band get to locations yet unperformed!\nCaricature by Michael Maness\n Thank you very much for any and all support making this music and subsequent performances happen!\nHuman Radio at Joe Pisapia's Studio, 2015\nPlease enjoy a brief taste from our archives....\"Me & Elvis\" from a live Rock 103 broadcast on Beale St. Memphis, 1989...the original pre-CD ska version. Thanks for your interest!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenges we might face once funded have to do with how we are received by the public at large. Will our old fans like the band's new material, the differentiation of sound? Will new fans be interested in a bunch of 50-something year old guys trying to bash about, singing about god-knows-what? Is there any relevance to what we are trying to do? We are trying to take a rock 'n' roll attitude about it now, no point in chasing modern trends and fashions. We sound like exactly like ourselves, and nobody else does!\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day, though, none of that really matters. This is a band of serious survivors, we have all made it through an array of professional hells, not all of them musical. And we have nothing to lose....not trying for the brass ring of big label deal, mass acceptance and success. It's kinda cliche, but we are in it for the love of playing the music again, finding our fans and friends out there.

We follow industry standards so you can easily find notebooks compatible with your tpad. You can also make your own custom pages using common binding equipment found in many offices.\nPLAY\n\nGrade 5 Titanium Spiral Coil with a Grade 5 Titanium Lock converts a standard spiral notepad (left picture) into a Titanium notepad (right picture). All \"E\" series tcoils use 3:1 hole standard, the most common standard used throughout the industry (3 holes per each inch). If your spiral notepad uses this standard (most of them do), you can replace the original spring with our tcoil to create your own Titanium notepad.\nThe size of tcoil is specified by the length of the paper (coil direction) and the holding capacity in pages (approximate number of standard thickness pages).\n$30,000\ntpad EXPLORER will ship with a separate refill of paper. We don't want to thicken the design of this model, it is a pocket tpad. When you finish the original set of pages, just refill in under a minute.\ntpad INVENTOR will ship more pages (from the original 160 pages to 320 pages) and larger tcoil to accommodate a thicker tpad. If you want to keep your tpad lighter, just remove some pages. It is, after all, a refillable notepad -- use as many pages as you want.\ntpad JOURNAL will ship with more pages (from the original 200 pages to 400 pages) and larger tcoil to accommodate a thicker tpad. If you want to keep your tpad lighter, just remove some pages. It is, after all, a refillable notepad -- use as many pages as you want.\nWe manufacture covers for tpads from pure Grade 5 Titanium, the revolutionary material typically reserved for space missions and bullet proof shields of advanced weapons.\nSuch amazing performance does not come cheap. The price of Grade 5 Titanium is 10 times higher than already very expensive aircraft grade aluminum. Titanium rings sell on average of $130 to $350; we could make 12 Titanium rings from the material we use in the smallest 3 x 5 inch tpads; the covers of larger tpads use considerably more material.\nThe cost of the material is just the beginning. The problem with manufacturing anything in Titanium, the strongest of all metals (by weight), is that conventional tools simply break apart when one attempts to use them for cutting Titanium. The most advanced methods, like laser cutting, face extreme challenges when dealing with an amazing hardness of Titanium.\nSo we need to move to nono-scale technologies removing individual atoms of Titanium to create a perfect quality cut of extreme precision, but at a high cost of time. The smallest 3 x 5 inch tpad may take over 24 hours to process, followed by finishing operations which, again, need extreme length of time due to the hardness of the material.\nThe material used for tpad covers can easily shield you from bullets; it will also survive any number of trips in your back pocket. You can unlock your tpad and refill it at any time with a large selection of papers available using standard disposable notepads, or you can use your office spiral binding equipment to create your own custom paper pages.\nThe cost of manufacturing tpads is very high. We are convinced their quality will blow you away and all leather notebooks, regardless of their embossing patterns, will look as cheap imitations when matched with an amazing beauty and strength of Titanium bound tpads.\nFor anyone with allergies Titanium offers the only material which doesn\u2019t react with human body.\ntcoil ADD-ONs\nto add any number of tcoils to any pledge, please use the table below for each tcoil added:\nE3-50, ADD +$11 USA / +$13 International\nE5-50, ADD +$13 USA / +$15 International\nE6-80, ADD +$14 USA / +$17 International\nE7-80, ADD +$14 USA / +$17 International\nE7-140, ADD +$21 USA / +$17 International\nE9.5-100, ADD +$17 USA / +$20 International\nE11-100, ADD +$25 USA / +$29 International\nE11-200, ADD +$32 USA / +$36 International\nM210-100, ADD +$16 USA / +$19 International\nM297-100, ADD +$26 USA / +$30 International\nM297-200, ADD +$33 USA / +$38 International\nWeather Proof paper\nWe are going to test several papers available on the market in various colors, from white to light blue and light green.\nRefills\nYou can find the right notepad at a store to use as a refill for tpads or tcoils by matching the patterns printed on the page to the hole patterns in a notepad at a store.

Documents bound with a spiral coil can open flat and offer 360 degree rotation for easy note taking.\nCoil binding hole patterns. There are several hole pattern used with coil binding. Our final selection of the pitch for each product may be adjusted based on many factors, including the manufacturing tests.\n4:1 pitch hole pattern uses 4 holes per inch on the edge of the document.\n0.2475\" pitch very similar to the 4:1 pitch. This pitch was designed to perfectly center 44 holes on an 11 inch binding edge.\n3:1 pitch uses 3 holes per inch on the edge of the document. It is our preferred pitch (at the moment) because of a heavy gauge of our Titanium wire vs. thin standards used in the industry.\n2.5:1 pitch coil (0.400 pitch coil) uses 2.5 holes per inch.\n2:1 pitch uses 2 holes per inch\n3.2:1 pitch (0.3125\" pitch) is common for larger books.\nNote\ntpad(TM) is a trademark of Santoren Inc. tpad system of notepads, including the system for refilling them is patent pending.

It is our goal to provide you with amazing looking products; we may, however, tweak the designs to satisfy limitations of the production environment and to adjust the design based on production model tests. The final weight of the product may be affected by these adjustments.

The main thing that interested me about the Explorer was the wide availability of the standard paper. Right now, I can (and often do) pick up a notepad of that size at Walmart for 19 cents, and with the Explorer, I could replace the flimsy cardstock cover with a long-lasting, durable and endlessly reusable titanium cover that won't tear and disintegrate in my travels. But now, with this major design modification, I will be forced to go online to special-order waterproof paper (that I, and I suspect most of the rest of us, don't particularly want or need), and which, according to the links that @Creator listed in the last update, will cost at least $14.00 each (an increase of 7,368% over the cost for the standard paper). But it's not even about the cost for me. It's about the inconvenience, and lower quality of the waterproof paper. I've found that some pens just don't work well with waterproof paper, and instead of the convenience of picking up replacement paper on a moment's notice wherever and whenever the need arises, I will have to order it online, and still not get what I really want. I, for one, am disappointed. I wish this change had been put to us as a proposal for discussion before the campaign ended, or maybe offered as an alternative reward option for the few backers who may want and prefer waterproof paper. It's a shame, because the original design was a great idea, but @Creator just turned what almost certainly would have become an essential EDC for me into something that will probably just go into a junk drawer and quickly forgotten.", "time": "almost 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Helmet Pickles", "content": "Thx", "time": "about 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Robert Western", "content": "Any new updates?", "time": "about 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Neale Fetterly", "content": "Is the ruler markings something we need to have asked for?

Turns out a lot of people have something they wish they did more often but don\u2019t. So I decided to use my 10 years of design + behavior change experience to come up with a solution. Soon afterwards, FLIP BAND was born.\nFLIP BAND is a wristband you wear as a reminder to do a goal of your choice, whether that\u2019s exercising, meditating, or just taking your vitamins. The act of wearing the band alone already makes it close to impossible to forget your goal, but here\u2019s the cool part... it\u2019s double-sided, and you only get to flip it to its green \u2018feel good\u2019 side after you reach your goal for the day. FLIP BAND seems very simple, but it leverages a wealth of learnings from behavioral psychology and operant conditioning to effectively increase your chances of sticking to your goals in the long-term.\nI originally had no intention of turning FLIP BAND into a product but after seeing how effective it was for friends and family I had to share it with other people. So here I am, Kickstarter!\nWhat people are saying:\n What kind of goals can FLIP BAND be used for?\nJust about anything really, but here are some popular examples: \nHow can something so simple actually work?\nThe FLIP BAND is more powerful than you think. It takes advantage of several aspects of human psychology to increase your chances of sticking to a goal. FLIP BAND works because:\nIt forces you to focus: Most people fail because they want to change too many things in their lives at once and as a result never really commit to any single change. Wearing a Flip Band forces you to focus on one change at a time. If you do this and end up forming one new good habit each month, you\u2019ll end up building 12 good habits per year\u2026 not bad.\nIt\u2019s rooted in science: Behavioral science states that every behavior requires three components to occur: ability, motivation, and a trigger. The trigger is the thing that reminds (or triggers) you to DO the behavior. Overtime, our own daily patterns can become triggers (e.g. waking up leads to you brushing your teeth) but in the early stages of building a new habit, we often need some kind of external trigger (e.g. a post-it note) to remind us to actually DO the behavior. That\u2019s exactly what the FLIP BAND is for your goal  \u2013 a trigger that\u2019s with you EVERYWHERE you go and on your wrist where you can easily see it.\nIt\u2019s rooted in MORE science: The simple act of flipping your FLIP BAND after you reach your goal and seeing a bright green checkmark is rooted in the science of positive reinforcement which has been proven to act as a motivator that strengthens a behavior over time (like sticking to your goal) \nIt leverages the power of accountability: People who pursue a goal with an accountability buddy (which we recommend) are on average 2x-5\u00d7 more likely to stick to their goals long term. That\u2019s why your order comes with a minimum of two FLIP BANDS.\nIt\u2019s tech-free (a.k.a. distraction free): How many times have you grabbed your phone with the intention of doing something specific (e.g. looking something up) but ended up getting distracted by a text message or notification in the process? Apps open you up to distractions simply by being on your phone. FLIP BAND will never do this... but it *will* keep working past two in the afternoon (can you say infinite batteries?)\nRewards:\nStretch goal unlocked: FLIP BAND is now available to everyone in white! \n                                 The easiest way to help is to share the project on facebook or twitter (won't auto-post). The more supporters we get, the more possibilities!\n Details:\nFLIP BAND is made of beautiful high-quality materials that are built to last, soft, and comfortable. It's doubly reinforced for durability and finished with high-precision embossed text for a sleek look and feel. Manufacturing is more costly this way but it's well worth it. \nIt has a great feeling *snap* when flipped\nBEFORE reaching your goal\nAFTER reaching your goal\nMY STORY\nIt's been a lifelong goal of mine to create things that help people. I've been a designer for over 10 years, have spent the past 5 years studying the psychology of behavior change, and 3 years co-founding a company called Everest that created what was once one of the most popular goal-setting apps. Earlier this year I also launched The Dept. of Motivation ... as you can see, I've been obsessed with finding ways to help people be their best selves for a long time, and this pursuit has led me to launch dozens of products along the way.\nA FREE REWARD FOR ANYONE...\nI want to live in a world where people wake up excited every day, regardless of their financial situation.

It's my goal to get you your Flip Band as soon as possible, and here's my plan to do so: \nFebruary: Submit final designs to manufacturer for first production run, packaging, and delivery to me (expected 3-4 week turnaround) \nEarly March: Quality assurance, finalize shipment & fulfillment process\nEnd of March: Begin fulfillment process to you (woohoo!)\nOur Kickstarter is over, but you can still order FLIP BAND here. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter, and it is my goal to get you your FLIP BAND as soon as possible. \n\nI have 5 years of experience shipping products (10 years of experience designing them), and the only real risk I see is that sometimes things can go awry in the manufacturing and shipping process that can't be planned for (a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost). I am overseeing every step of the process myself to minimize chances of unexpected delays and ensure that you receive a quality product as soon as possible. \n\nTrust me, I am just as excited as you are to get you your FLIP BAND and see what you accomplish with it!

I\u2019ve had to reinvent myself over and over to get hired by TV shows, movie producers, and even by Priceline.com when I was 60+ years old.\nSource: IMDB\nIf you or someone you know is over 50 and feels like it\u2019s too late to catch up and re-invent the second half of their lives, TRUST ME\u2026IT\u2019S NOT!\nPeople over 50 have been pretty beat up lately with downsizing, a slumping economy, and so many changes in the way things work. That\u2019s why I wrote this new book Catch Me Up and I need your help to get it to the people who need it most.\nIn a nutshell, this book is about two things:\n1. Achieving great things in your life at any age\n2. How to leverage the new technology around us today to do anything you want, at warp speed.\nI have another confession. Until just recently I HATED new technology. My \u201csmart\u201d phone made me feel stupid. My grandkids had to show me how to use Facebook. I even refused to have an email account. You know what I found out? Without this know-how, I was becoming irrelevant\u2026and a guy like me can\u2019t afford to be irrelevant. So I did something about it.\nI went on a mission to find people who had been laid off, lost careers, had been downsized and replaced by younger people with more tech skills; but who actually fought back and won!\nI interviewed some amazing people for this book.\nPLAY\n\n Meet Cliff Brahm who left the rat race at 50, and became his own boss.\nPLAY\n\nThis is Dave Bateman, who left his legal practice and became a coffee farmer in Hawaii.\nPLAY\n\n This is Julie Cole whose spectacular entrepreneurial spirit has grown stronger in her later years.\n The biggest common denominator among the success stories in the book is that in every case these newly energized folks have discovered new technologies to create their new lives.\nThis is not just a book of \u201cfeel good\u201d stories.\nThis is real life inspiration along with the vital tools and training needed to accomplish great things at any age!\n This book and the website are labors of love. I really believe it can give hope, skills, and even community to a portion of our population that really needs it right now.\nFrankly, lofty goals like this are not that appealing to big publishers. Going the traditional route would've required a number of sacrifices including a change in the overall message. So I've decided to take a page from my own book, so to speak, and use crowdsourcing to fund this project. \n Through Kickstarter, I can preserve the integrity of this movement and give you, my backers, the chance to be a significant part of my cherished project.  You may be asking yourself\u2026\n Most folks have parents, grandparents, an aunt or an uncle who could use some inspiration and maybe even some community. Getting this book in their hands from a guy like me might give them the inspiration to get up, dust themselves off and try again.\n First of all, thank you for scrolling all the way to the bottom and for believing in my vision for Catch Me Up. To become one of my backers, just click on the big green button at the top of the page, to the right of our video. Kickstarter will ask you for your pledge, which reward you want, and how you want to sign up. Signing up is easy! You can even do it through Facebook.\nShirt Design Mockup [Work in progress, this may change]\n We will update you RIGHT HERE on Kickstarter!

It plays best from 5-10 players and each round takes mere minutes to play (but you\u2019ll likely find yourself playing it all evening).\nWe all debate with our friends, family and co-workers over numerous topics every day, and even play Devil\u2019s Advocate once in a while. We debate issues from the trivial, such as \u201cIs bacon the ultimate ingredient?\u201d to the profound, such as \u201cDoes charity breed poverty?\u201d This is why we created The Great Debate. It\u2019s a party game that not only provides a highly interactive way for people to voice their opinions about these subjects in a safe and playful environment, but also uses our unique \u201cIcebreaker\u201d system to help you learn more about the people you\u2019re playing with. Who knows, the person you just met might become your new hiking buddy, skydiving mentor, or scrap booking partner! \nThe Great Debate is not just fun, but also educational and enlightening. Since it covers a wide array of topics, people often learn about topics they might not know about. They may hear, or even pose, a different opinion that gives them cause to reflect or laugh. Even those who are initially shy about speaking in groups can quickly overcome their fears since they\u2019re only given 30 seconds to talk on a subject \u2013 and they don\u2019t even have to believe what they say. The point is not to be right, but to be more convincing than your opponent and to have fun while doing it. The time limit teaches people how to hone their debate skills by thinking on their feet, and delivering their points in a short, concise fashion. Play our game, and you\u2019ll soon find yourself having an engaging, thought provoking, laughing great time with your friends and family.\nHere is a limited print and play version prototype to give you idea of the questions in the game.\n80 Unique Debate Cards \u2013 hand selected and play tested for fun!\n5 Blank Cards to make the game unique for your group\n10 \u201cA\u201d Vote Cards\n10 \u201cB\u201d Vote Cards\nRules\nIt's a party -- do you really need rules?

I was stuck there 9 years ago, and I'd lost hope. Then I scraped and dug my way out of it, and I am proof that change is possible.\nThis book will help you make any change:\nExercise\nEating healthy\nGetting out of debt\nOvercoming procrastination\nLosing weight\nDealing with frustrations & stress\nImproving relationships\nSimplifying & decluttering\nMeditating and being mindful\nDealing with major life changes\nAnd much more\nThis book starts about being about habit change, but it's much more ... it's about how to live, and how to master the process of change. It's about dealing with major life changes, and small frustrating ones too.\nIn the process of creating a small change in your life, by following the steps in this book ... you'll start to develop core Zen skills I've learned from my studies, to find peace, contentment, and the ability to adjust to situations as they change.\nIn practicing these skills, you begin to truly understand them. And in understanding these skills, you'll start to overcome your struggles.\nThis is a volume of condensed learning about the process of change, and the nature of our minds. And a how-to on how to change your habits and overcome procrastination.\nMy Story\nIt started with my struggle with change \u2014 in 2005, I was an overweight, sedentary, broke, deeply-in-debt, junk-food-eating smoker surrounded by clutter and no time for my wife or kids. I was stuck, desperate, overwhelmed, with no idea how to get out.\nBut then I learned the principles of change, by doing a ton of research, studying those who were successful at change, and making some small changes. One at a time. Through these experiments, I learned things that help with any change.\nOver the next few years, I changed everything ... one step at a time:\nQuit smoking\nStarted running, ran several marathons & a 50-mile ultramarathon\nStarted eating healthier, eventually became vegan\nLost 60 lbs.\nSimplified and got rid of clutter\nGot out of debt\nStarted a successful blog, quit my day job\nOvercame procrastination, wrote numerous books\nFound time for my health, family, writing, reading\nAnd much more\nSince then I've helped tens of thousands of struggling people change their lives through habit change. I've learned what works, and what doesn't, and honed my habit method.\nThe Heart of Any Problem\nGoing deeper than the mechanics of habit change, this book will teach you how to get at the heart of any problem you face in life. Any struggle you're facing: procrastination, unhappiness with ourselves, anger with others, stress and worry, dealing with loss or illness.\nWhat is the heart of any struggle? It's attachment to our ideals. Attachment to comfort and the way we'd like things, attachment to how we think people should act, how we should act, how things should go.\nWe all face this problem, and we can't avoid having ideals. These ideals can be useful, but when we become too tightly attached to them, we create problems for ourselves: frustration, irritation, anger, disappointment, stress, worry.\nThis stops us from making habit changes, and makes dealing with other people and major changes in our lives much more difficult.\nBy getting to the heart of your struggles, you will find the way to overcome them.\nChange yourself, change the world\nWhen you back this project, it's not just to get a copy of my book. I'd like you to be a part of a movement, and backing this says that you think this is a worthy movement.\nWhat movement? My hope is that this book will help you change your life \u2014 to help you change habits, become more focused, procrastinate less, and find peace.\nAnd if you can change yourself, you've changed a small part of the world.\nBy changing ourselves, we become the example of change for others around us.\nWe become inspiration for further change, and that spreads into the world.\nMy deepest wish is for you to use this book and create change in yourself, and everyone around you.\nIf this happens, we've succeeded.\nTestimonials\nAs I wrote this book, I tested it out on a small group of alpha testers who implemented it and gave me feedback. I called them the Change Labs group, and they were instrumental in shaping this book.\n\"Leo has distilled a ton of actionable wisdom into the Zen Habits book and I couldn't recommend it enough. Change Labs, a program to alpha test the tools and processes in the book, was one of the most memorable things I've done this year and I can't wait to read it!\" \n-Alyson Madrigan\n---\n\"The Change Labs concept has brought fundamental changes to my life. I struggled with severe procrastination in my illustration work which I can say I have overcome during this year. Working both on the fundamentals (underlying fears) both on habits (making 20 min drawing an everyday priority) have lifted me to a different level. I have just finished a 240 page children's story book in a quality and time frame I never dreamed I was able to. This was a great proof for me.\n\"I also love the simplicity of his concepts. No bullshit, just pure inspiration and actions.\"\n- Cecilia Simonyi\n---\n\"Working with Leo challenged some deeply rooted beliefs about how to lead a fulfilling life. \n\"It was like having a eureka moment; a paradigm shift occurred.\n\"You come out with new ways of thinking and a new arsenal of tools to deal with difficulties.\"\n- Kavi Thancanamootoo\n---\n\"Learning new habits with Leo was the best thing that happened to me in a very long time. Life changer. Forever grateful Leo ...\"\n- Hanane\nWhere the Money Will Go\nI'm asking for $44,700, which will pay for:\nAn editor ($1,200)\nBook designer ($5,000)\nPrinting ($7,000)\nShipping ($3,500)\nKickstarter/Amazon payments fee ($4,000)\nPublishing project manager ($5,000)\nWebsite, ebook, video production ($6,000)\nInternational shipping additional cost $2,000\nLeo's salary $7,000\nTaxes: $4,000\nTotal: $44,700\nNote: the above positions are already filled.\nIn addition, there might be a few possible additional printing costs and unexpected costs, so I'd love a little padding on our budget.\n(Edited: I added international shipping costs, a small salary for myself, and other production costs that weren't initially included, and removed the cost of an event, which I'll pay for from my salary.)\nStretch funding goal\nI'd love it if we could go over the $45,000 minimum goal. If you guys can help me get to a higher funding figure, this will allow me to:\nPrint a 2nd, less-limited edition to sell on Amazon and elsewhere\nGet paid (a little more) for some of my own time\nSee that this is a viable model for publishing future books\nShow the world that this topic is important\nSo don't stop helping this project if we hit the minimum!\nBONUS: If we get to higher than the goal, I promise to start making videos to send out to all backers \u2014 videos about my writing routine, my workouts, how I cook my healthy meals, parenting, etc. And one of my beautiful wife and kids. I'll make one new video for every $15K over the $45K goal. Update: I've recorded some bonus videos already, more to come!\nKickstarter-exclusive Bonuses\nI'm offering a number of bonuses for different reward levels here on Kickstarter, not available anywhere else:\nFirst, the limited-edition digital and print versions of this book are not going to be sold anywhere else for at least 6 months, until I do a 2nd edition.\nExclusive webinar with Lift: I'm going to hold a limited webinar (200-person limit) with the CEO of the Lift habit app, on creating habits. This will be held in December 2014.\nBonus guides: I'm creating special guides for the reward levels from the Print Edition level and higher. They'll be PDF guides to 1) procrastination & effectiveness; and 2) mindfulness. These won't be available anywhere else. Read more.\nEarly bird feedback: For the $98+ reward level, I'm going to give you first access to the web version of the book in December (you'll still get 3 copies of the print edition when it's ready), before anyone else. This will give you a chance to give me feedback that could change the book before it's printed.\n10-person webinars: For the $300+ reward level, I'm going to hold a webinars for 10 people at a time, where all 10 people in the webinar can ask me questions. They'll last about an hour, and I'll schedule them in December & January, so you can pick whatever date/time works best for your schedule. These webinars are more intimate than the webinar above.\n3-month coaching & private event: At the $1,500 level, I'm taking on 15 people in a small-group coaching program that will last from January through March, and end in a private event in San Francisco. The coaching will be on habits and dealing with life changes and other struggles \u2014 basically, what I cover in the book \u2014 and you can ask me questions and work with the other people in the program, getting accountability and support. The event will be with me, and will last an entire weekend in April, and will include seminars and group activities and guest speakers and tea and food and maybe some meditation. It'll be fun! You'll need to pay your own way to get there, and your own accommodations. Read more about the coaching program & event.\nSpeak at your event: At the top level, I'll give a talk at your conference or private event. I almost never give talks, so this is a pretty exclusive bonus. I'll speak for up to an hour, on a topic we agree upon, and can be available for Q&A after or whatever else you like (within reason). You'll also have to pay for my airfare, on top of the $10,000.\nSpecial Thanks to My Team\nI didn't create this book alone:\nBrian Hertzog, head of Pipe Dreams Publishing\nJuli Anne Patty, editor\nMatt Avery, designer\nMatt D'Avela, videographer\nFrancisco Garcia Hristov, author photo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm confident this book will be printed, but there are a few risks and challenges to note:\n\n1. Possible delays from the printer \u2014 though I've been published by a traditional publisher and have self-published numerous ebooks, I've never printed a book on my own before. But I'm using a highly-recommended professional printer, so I'm confident things will go well.\n\n2. Shipping delays \u2014 We'll be using a fulfillment company to ship the books out once printed, and it's possible this will take a little longer than I'd like, so we'll all have to breathe if there are any delays.\n\n3. Technical glitches \u2014 I'll be publishing this book on the web and in a few digital editions (Kindle, epub for the iPad, and PDF), so there is always the possibility of technical glitches that delay things. But I've done these before, and they're not that difficult.\n\nAll of this is doable, and I don't anticipate major problems.\n\nSee the estimated timeline here: http://zenhabitsbook.com/timeline/\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "New Version of Book Planned for End of 2015", "update_content": "A lot of people have been asking to buy the book after the Kickstarter campaign ended.

Visit BlankForces.com\nFor the uninitiated, E.D.C. stands for Every Day Carry and is a popular topic of discussion regarding the need to always be prepared no matter the circumstances. EDC Ink\u2122 is a line of high quality, rugged, and durable pens for your keychain or bag, designed so you will never be without one of the most used items in everyday life.\nTHE DESIGN\nAs a designer and someone that loves to travel I often find myself in need of a pen for quickly sketching an idea, making a list, or filling out the inevitable form.\nThis pen hides on your keychain and will travel with you everywhere allowing you to forget about it. It\u2019s the perfect everyday companion...you will never have to ask to borrow a pen again!\nI'm a minimalist when it comes to what I carry and don't like to carry extra stuff or have to remember extra things. With this need in mind I started to look for a small/cool pen that I could carry every day without having to think about it and without it being too big and bothersome.\nAfter a lot of searching I couldn't find anything that met my needs so I decided to create my own compact pen which attached to my keyring.\nMY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:\n1. It needed to be a very compact, go every-where size which fit on my keyring.\n2. It needed to use standard, easy-to-find refills.\n3. It needed to be easy to replace the ink without any special tools.\n4. It needed to be rugged, durable, and reflect my appreciation for design and quality.\nThese pens are made from the classic combination of 304 stainless steel and brass; the metals helped define the design and provided the inspiration for the pure, clean aesthetic. Every part is functional and simplified to the extreme. These pens utilize the raw metal\u2019s natural characteristics and native colors to produce the detail accents of the tip and end screw.\nThese precision machined parts fit together so perfectly that the parting line between the pen barrel and cap virtually disappear, resulting in an object that hides its identity until it\u2019s used.\nDespite their small size, the precise fit and weight of the raw metals make them feel substantial, solid, and nice to handle.\nLASER ENGRAVING\nI'm very excited to offer these pens in three engraved treatments that really elevate the pen to a piece of functional art which you get to enjoy and carry with you every day.\nPLAY\n\nWhile I love the purity of this design on its own, I often have to measure things for my work, so I added both metric and imperial measurement scales on the PRO version. I have found this added function to be incredibly useful and right there where you need it.\nABOUT THE ENGRAVING - This process uses a high powered FIBER laser to remove metal, so the engraving is actually recessed into the surface of the metal resulting in a permanent mark that also adds texture to the surface of the pens and provides more grip to hold the pen when writing.\nLASER ENGRAVING OPTIONS\n1. NAKED - No Engraving - This is a completly naked pen; it is super-clean and elegant.\n\n2. PRO - The Measuring Scale - With both standard and metric on the same pen. An incredibly useful combination, a pen and a ruler in one.\n\n3. ICON - The cool linear box pattern is seamlessly engraved all the way around the entire pen, including the cap. You can't even tell where the cap ends and the pen barrel begins.\n\n4. LACE - A beautiful and elegant pattern, seamlessly engraved all the way around the entire pen, including the cap. You can't even tell where the cap ends and the pen barrel begins.\n5. JOIN, or DIE - I'm really excited to add our first Backer selected pattern. It was selected from a group of four designs with a landslide victory of 46% of the vote. \nFor those that aren't familiar with the \"Join, or Die\" graphic, it is an historic image created by Benjamin Franklin around 1754 and represents the quest for strength and freedom through solidarity. Each part of the snake represents one of the first colonies of the United States. Learn more here: Wikipedia.org/wiki/Join,_or_Die\n\"SPECIAL ARTIST EDITION\" ENGRAVINGS\nI am collaborating with some very talented artists to offer some amazing and original \"Special Artist Edition\" engraving patterns. Please note that these engraving patterns each have their own separate pricing and reward tiers.\nI\u2019m a huge fan of Dan Hillier\u2019s incredibly detailed drawings, collages and paintings. His mind blowing pieces are full of wonder and classic details. Based in England, Dan\u2019s work unites a unique range of spiritual and historical elements. His part human, part animal subjects, transports us to fascinating new worlds where the 1800's and fantasy collide. See more of Dan\u2019s beautiful work at www.DanHillier.com\n  The HILLIER : SAPLING is currently only available in the X1 size. \nI'm very honored and excited to have the opportunity to collaborate with illustrator and street muralist, Liqen. Originally from Spain, he has traveled the world painting his thought provoking murals. Through his imaginative use of hybrid creatures that appear to have evolved from prehistoric times, he brings awareness to modern time issues and moral dilemmas. His work takes you on a never imagined visual journey that teases different levels of the mind.  \nClick HERE to see a cool video of Liqen in action.\nLearn more about him: www.Liqen.org/\n  LIQEN : CABEZAS design is available in both X1 and X2 sizes.\nDan Funderburgh is a Brooklyn-based illustrator, artist, and wallpaper designer whose pieces are beautiful and incredibly unique. With his often playful use of everyday objects he creates surprising and delightful works of art that are reminiscent of historical patterns but with a modern spin. \nI have been a longtime admirer of Dan\u2019s unique work and think we are incredibly lucky to have him involved with the project! See more of his work: www.DanFunderburgh.com\nTHE TWO SIZES\nEDC Ink is available in two sizes: X1 and the slightly longer X2. All pens will come with the small stainless steel split ring already attached to the pen's cap making it easy to put it on any keyring.\nX1 - Specifications:\nLength: 3.2\" (81mm)\nDiameter: 0.31\" (7.9mm)\nWeight: 0.83 oz. (23.6 grams)\nMaterials: 304 Stainless Steel Body. Brass Tip, and Brass End Screw.\nThis is the smallest pen and the one I carry (I have medium sized hands). It virtually disappears on your key ring. While the X1 is a bit small for a lengthy writing or sketching session, it is perfect for capturing an idea or jotting down items on your to-do list.\nX2 - Specifications:\nLength: 4\" (101mm)\nDiameter: 0.31\" (7.9mm) \nWeight: 1.1 oz. (31.4 grams)\nMaterials: 304 Stainless Steel Body. Brass Tip, and Brass End Screw.\n\nX2 would be better for people with large hands, people that plan to do more writing, or someone that doesn't mind carrying a slightly longer pen.\nTHE AWESOME INK REFILL\nThe EDC Ink pens are designed around the standard D1 refill which is readily available. This compact refill is typically used in multi-selector pens and is available in most stores that sell ink refills.\nI will be supplying these pens with my favorite refill to sketch with, the well-known but typically hard-to-find Pilot HI-TEC-C Slims. This refill is ultra precise, smooth, and fast drying\u2026 which is especially important for us lefties.\n\nIf you would like extra Pilot HI-TEC-C Slims (blue or black color ink) refills, please add $5 per refill to your pledge. \nNOTE: The D1 size refill is also available in the popular and well respected Fisher Space Pen refill. This special pressurized version is known by many for its ability to write under water, upside down, or in outer space. You can easily order this refill through the Fisher Space Pen website here. I won't be supplying this refill.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nFirst STRETCH GOAL reached! $20,000 unlocked the backer selected JOIN, or DIE graphic option.\nSecond STRETCH GOAL of $60,000 reached!\nWith backers support, we have now surpassed the $60,000 stretch goal that allows us to offer black as well as blue ink. Now backers have their choice of either blue or black ink for their pens and/or any additional refills. \nTITANIUM KEYRINGS\nI researched and tested a lot of keyring options from wire to small carabiners and settled on the ultra-lightweight and virtually indestructible GRADE 5 Titanium Keyrings. These beautiful split rings are 1.2\" in diameter (30mm dia.).\n\nAdd an awesome GRADE 5 Titanium Keyring for an additional pledge of $4.\nTHE PERFECT GIFT\nFor the guy or girl who has everything, this is the perfect high-quality, functional gift that they can always have with them while reminding them of you. Who doesn't need a pen? \nWhile I would love to be able to ship these pens by Christmas, we won't have enough time. So I've created a beautiful holiday gift card that we can send out before Christmas. The card shows the pen actual size (closed on the cover of the card and open when the card is opened) with the desired laser engraving pattern. A blank envelope will also be provided for the card. \nFollowing is what the holiday gift card will look like.\n\nIf you would like a gift card, please add $6 to your pledge to cover the cost of the card and shipping.\nPACKAGING\nIn order for me to keep costs down, I will be shipping these pens with only basic packaging. They are designed to live on your keychain, so I also would prefer to not contribute to the landfill. \nGIFT PACKAGING - If this is intended as a gift, I can provide a simple pen box for an additional $5 pledge.\nREPLACING THE INK REFILL\nThere are two ways to replace the ink refill. The simplest is to grab the tip of the ink refill and pull it from the body. The other is to use a dime or flat head screwdriver in the slot in the end screw which unscrews to reveal the refill. \nPROJECT TIMELINE\nI am happy to say that we will be making these pens here in Los Angeles, CA. The following timeline is based on the production of 500 pens, and I think it is realistic target even with the slowdown during the holidays. \nKICKSTARTER PRICING\nFortunately, by using Kickstarter we are cutting out the middleman (the retailer) and I am able to offer these pens at a significantly lower price than the future retail priceing. Kickstarter does take 5%, and the credit card processing is another 3-5% for a total of 8-10%.\nA VERY BIG THANK YOU!\nI'm really excited about this project and if you have read this far I'm glad you are finding it interesting. I have a lot more ideas, and with your support we can make this project, and hopefully many others, possible.\n\nI would love for everyone to always be ready to capture their ideas\u2026 you never know when it will be the one!\nPRESS INFO\nClick here for the press kit download link.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDesign: Done\nEngineering: Done\nMechanical Prototyping: Done\nLaser Engraving: Done - High Quality Samples Made\n\nI earn my living as a product designer and have been fortunate to have worked for some of the largest companies in the world including Harman/Kardon, HP, Belkin, and more. Product development is my passion, and there is no doubt that I will do everything I can to deliver what I promise. See more of my work at www.Hayes-Studio.com\n\nThe groundwork for this project has been completed. I have met with several local (Los Angeles) based machine shops that are excited about this project and are ready to start as soon as the project is funded. I am very happy to be manufacturing these pens here in the USA, and fortunately Los Angeles has a large number of CNC machine shops due to the large aerospace industry. These pens will be created on the same machines that make parts for the aerospace industry. \n\nLASER ENGRAVING\nThe laser engraving requires a lot of accuracy to achieve the quality I am expecting. As you can see from the video, I have found the perfect partner to achieve this.\n\nSCHEDULE\nIf the target funding goal is reached early, I will do my best to expedite deliver and start production before the Kickstarter campaign ends so we will have more time to prepare the pens for shipping. I will be ordering the TITANIUM Keyrings as well as the Pilot Hi-TEC-C refills from Japan.\n\nMATERIAL ACQUISITION\nThese pens have been designed to be produced using standard sized/shaped raw materials which are readily available, so acquiring the metal for production should not be a problem.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Elles", "content": "Kevin..I have been using the pens for almost two months and just want you to know I even like them more.

I conducted a national online survey on people\u2019s experiences with getting food stuck in their teeth and what I learned was truly shocking\u2026\n-- 65% of people have had an \"extremely embarrassing\"  or \"traumatic\" experience resulting from unknowingly having had food stuck in their teeth\n-- 70% of people have a friend or family member who frequently gets food stuck in their teeth\nMoreover, I learned that people use random, reflective objects to check their teeth throughout the day, such as shiny office staplers and reflective picture frames on their desk\u2026 Which led me to ask, REALLY?!\nTOP 10 OFFENDERS: These foods more than any other plague civilization.\n#1 Spinach\n#2 Ribs\n#3 Popcorn\n#4 Steak\n#5 Poppy seeds\n#6 Spices\n#7 Corn on the cob\n#8 Broccoli\n#9 Seeds from berries\n#10 Bread\nTHE INNOVATION\nI believe in options, so I designed these Excavation Tools shown below.\nClose up: SHIT-IN-M\u2019TEETH Excavation Tools\nA formidable arsenal at your finger tips: a Pick Axe, Jackhammer, Battle Axe, Sword and Missile. And just in case you missed it, there are traditional toothpicks at the bottom if you don\u2019t like progress. It shows six tooth picks here, but my hope is to get eight or ten designed into the final product.\nWhat you see above is a laser-cut piece of black acrylic. The final product will be die-stamped plastic, looking almost identical, and I am in the process of evaluating vendors and the final production process. From the start I have been advised by an engineer with deep experience in die-stamping and I know the production method will work.\nThe backside of the mirror will provide vital instructions for how to operate SHIT-IN-M\u2019TEETH.

Sure, you may choose to doubt climate change, but no one in your meeting doubts you had steak for lunch. \n\nNumber two risk? A key issue to manage is mailing and shipping costs. My cost model makes very conservative (i.e., high) assumptions about mailing costs. In my mind, your love life or professional existence may be hanging in the balance here, so I don\u2019t want any setbacks on the shipping front. Also, I only plan to produce only 500-600 units of SHIT-IN-M\u2019TEETH so fulfillment should be manageable. \n\nNumber three risk? Choking hazard. Seriously.

Anyone can use his music - including you! FOR FREE! His music has ended up in countless films, shows, video games, apps, online videos, and pretty much anywhere you can think of. Ever watch a YouTube video? Then you've probably heard his music. If you\u2019ve ever used Kevin\u2019s music and were waiting for a way to give back, now is the time. Just a small pledge from you can help us tell his story and encourage others to follow in his footsteps. Also by pledging, you'll get awesome rewards like digital downloads of the finished film, DVDs, posters, autographed sheet music, and more.\nIn 1996, during the early days of the web, Kevin MacLeod, a software programmer with an interest in composing, founded a personal webpage Incompetech.com (named so after his fascination with incompetence and technology). After music he created for a composing job was rejected, he put the music on his website for free hoping that someone out there would find a use for it. We will tell the story of how in 18 years since Incompetech\u2019s humble beginnings, it has grown from a few songs to thousands that have been heard by millions of people worldwide.\nThroughout college and beyond, we, the producers, used Kevin\u2019s music without realizing who Kevin was, or how big he had become. Curious, we began to research him, wondering how someone whose music was so widespread could be so unknown? The more we learned, the more questions we had: What do other composers think of his business model? What is the significance of Incompetech post the YouTube copyright crisis and SOPA/PIPA (Stop Online Piracy Act/Protect Internet Protocol Act), where copyright laws are choking the Internet\u2019s creative potential?\nWe will also cover various people who have used Kevin\u2019s music like: Machinima, Team Coco, Facing Fear (Oscar Nominated Short), PowerPark (An amusement park in Finland), the Nostalgia Chick, Film Brain, MikeJ, Phelous, Hugo, BuzzFeed, College Humor, Monty Python, CaptainSparklez, The Fine Bros, IGN, The Syndicate Project, Tobuscus, JeromeASF, Rooster Teeth, Sky Does MInecraft, Shane Dawson, Michelle Phan, FPS Russia, Enchufe.TV, KSIOlajidebt, SeaNanners, Philip DeFranco (SxePhil), Yogscast, Slamacow, Bad Teeth, CGP Grey, Element Animation, Jack Vale, SethBling, Mediocre Films, Mondo Media, TomSka, OfficialNerdCubed, SSundee, DeadloxMC, Team Crafted, Troye Sivan, ExplodingTNT, Laci Green, EricArchive, GK Films, The Stanley Parable, Kerbal Space Program, Evan Glodell (Bellflower), Magnetic Billiards, Card Hero, Chronicles of a Dark Lord, Your Doodles are Bugged!, Galactic Conflict RTS, Battlehorn (game), Shadow of the Game, Ball: Infinite Challenge, Dream Flight (game), coLAR Mix, The Blockheads (game), Sneak Mouse (game), Putt The Planets, and many many more\nOur Official Poster\nWe can't make this film without you! The funding for this campaign is essential in enabling us to obtain the equipment and materials needed to tell this story the way it deserves. Of course, our goal is the bare minimum we need to proceed. With our current goal we would be forced to do remote interviews with many of our interview subjects, relying on whatever equipment and expertise they could find. Additional funds would go towards funding travel to said interviewees, and for very costly post-production processes such as audio mixing, color-correction, and visual effects work. Every pledge is important!\nIf yo know someone who is using Kevin\u2019s music feel free to email us at:\n\"sightings(@)RoyaltyFreeDoc.com\".\nIf you feel you have something you can contribute email us at:\n\"help(@)RoyaltyFreeDoc.com\".", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe need to raise the funds to fly out in order to interview our subjects otherwise we have to do remote interviews with whatever quality camera and equipment they have.

With Love Your Face, you can be both.\n#2 OUR SPECIAL INGREDIENT \u2013 AN ANCIENT HEALING HERB: \nWhile researching ingredients for our formula, we discovered a forgotten, ancient herb call Plantain (not the banana-like plant, though!), so powerful, Native Americans referred to it as \u201clife medicine.\u201d\nUsed by cultures around the world for centuries, this herb not only works as an anti-inflammatory, it's an all-natural analgesic and antioxidant that has also been found to enhance the effectiveness of SPF in sunscreens.\nLove Your Face is the very FIRST skincare line that uses this herb in an entire line of natural products. Scroll down to the \"Our Special Ingredient\" section to learn more about this amazing plant.\n#3 MINIMALIST:\nLess is more. You don't need bottles of half-used, chemical-based skincare products piling up in your bathroom cabinet \u2013 you need something that you'll use and something that works.\n\nLove Your Face puts an end to counter clutter with a simple five-product line of essential skincare products. Plus, the bold, and beautiful containers are so sleek, you won't want to hide them.\n#4 FEARLESS:\nLove Your Face is a social enterprise with a mission that goes beyond simply creating high-quality, all-natural skincare. Every year, we'll give a percentage of our profits back to the community through our FEARLESS FUND to help other women who want to change their lives and the lives of others through entrepreneurial and community-based projects. \n#5 ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS:\n100% of the ingredients we source are natural, so we think it's extremely important to take care of the planet we all live on. All of our packaging \u2013 from our glass bottles to our packing material \u2013 is eco-friendly, reusable, or fully recyclable.\nBy becoming a backer of this project, you will help us launch this movement, and in exchange, you will receive Love Your Face products (and some great bonuses) at a highly discounted price.\nSample-Size Kits vs. Full-Size Kits\nSample-size kits contain our cleanser, scrub, mask and lotion in 1oz glass jars. Full-size kits contain 4oz glass jars of our mask, scrub, and lotion and 8oz glass bottles of our cleanser and spray.\nFearless Weekend\nIf there's a gap between where you are in life right now and where you want to be, the Fearless Weekend is for you. You'll join dozens of other fearless women for a powerful weekend of fun and growth in the heart of trendy Nashville, TN.\n\nFor two days, from August 29 - 30, 2015, we'll help you find the clarity, confidence and courage to lead the life you've always wanted to live. You'll discover how to boldly unleash your gifts onto the world while you make life-long friendships with other passionate women.\n\n(Sorry guys, this is for women only!)\nSpa & Adventure Day\nThe day after the Fearless Weekend is YOUR day. We're taking up to six women for a full day of adventure and rejuvenation.\n\nWe'll start the day with breakfast at one of Nashville's most popular restaurants. Afterward, we'll take you just outside Nashville for a team building, zip line tour through the beautiful landscape of Tennessee. You'll be served a gourmet, all vegetarian lunch and, in the afternoon, we'll head to the spa for two relaxing treatments. For dinner, we'll take you to another Nashville hot-spot for incredible food and great company.\n\nIt'll be a day you'll never forget, not only because of the experiences you'll have, but because of the life-long friendships that will be created. (Note: This event will take place the day after the Fearless Weekend.)\n1-on-1 Business Coaching\nDo you run your own business or have an idea for a new business? Through 1-on-1 business coaching, Laurel can help you ignite your business.\n\nYou'll learn how to bring in more clients, make more money, and have more free time, all with more ease, so you'll effortlessly be able to share your passion and talent with the world.

Your friend or family member will get her rewards shipped directly in March 2015.\nWe don't think it's necessary to clutter your bathroom cabinets with dozens of products...most of which you don't even use.\n\u201cLess is more\u201d when it comes to skincare. You only need a few, high-quality products to uncover your most radiant and flawless skin.\nThe Love Your Face skincare line consists of just five simple (and essential) facial skincare products:\n[MAKE TODAY COUNT] CLEANSER - 8oz (Aloe + Plantain)\n[KEEP TAKING CHANCES] SCRUB - 4oz (Aloe + Plantain)\n[BREAK THE RULES] MASK - 4oz (Aloe + Plantain)\n[MAKE IT HAPPEN] LOTION - 4oz (Aloe + Hyaluronic Acid)\n[FIND YOUR VOICE] SPRAY - 8oz (Aloe + Rose)\nTHE FULL COLLECTION: Includes the entire 5-piece collection listed above plus a reusable cotton pouch. Everything is beautifully packaged in a kraft gift box.\nTHE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION: Includes the full-size cleanser, scrub and lotion plus a reusable cotton pouch. \nSAMPLE SIZE KIT: Includes the cleanser, scrub, mask and lotion, each in 1oz glass jars packaged in a small kraft gift box.\nAll our products are 100% natural and completely free of harmful parabens, mineral oil, phthalates, sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, and synthetic fragrances.\nWHAT'S IN A NAME?\nEach of the Love Your Face products is named with a piece of advice we'd give our younger selves. Everyday, they're a daily reminder of what it takes to live life fearlessly.\nThrough extensive research and help from horticulturist Ashlyn Morgan, we discovered an ancient herb that's been used for thousands of years to sooth and heal skin.\nYet, this amazing plant has been all but lost to our culture over the last several decades...until now.\nThis ancient healing herb is Plantago Major. It's more commonly known as \u201cPlantain\u201d (although it's different than the banana-like plant with the same name).\nWhen we traced this plant back through history, what we found was incredible...\nLove Your Face is the VERY FIRST skincare company to use plantain for its entire line of products. And we will source our plantain locally from female farmer & horticulturalist, Ashlyn Morgan, who will grow it exclusively for us in a special, apothecary garden on her 50-acre organic farm in East Tennessee (starting in Spring 2015).\nPlantain is great for your skin because it is...\nOur broader mission at Love Your Face is to create a company that helps and empowers other women. Creating a skincare line that allows you feel beautiful and confident about the way you look is one way we do that. Another way is through the FEARLESS FUND.\nThe FEARLESS FUND provides scholarships and training for women who want to open businesses or start community projects that positively affect the community. Once a year, we'll run a contest and award financial support to women who have great ideas and want to turn those ideas into reality. (Note: Kickstarter funds will not go towards FF scholarships.)\nWe believe that women who follow their dreams are unstoppable. And we want to be a part of the ripple effect of positive change that spreads throughout the world when we start taking action to create better lives for ourselves and others.\nWe've made small, test market batches of Love Your Face products, but the funds raised via Kickstarter will help us to fully develop and package Love Your Face, so it's ready for release to the public.\nThe moment this campaign ends, we'll ship Holiday Gift Cards so backers will have them in time to give as gifts to friends and family. We'll finalize our formulation and order the materials needed to start bulk production\u2014ingredients, bottles, packaging, and labels. Manufacturing will start in January 2015 and we'll start taking orders at LYFace.com. Rewards to all backers will be shipped by March 2015.\nBusiness website setup (shopping cart, plugins, etc.) \u2013 3%\nBusiness entity set up (trademarks, insurance, etc.) \u2013 8%\nSourcing organic plantain from TN \u2013 15%\nPurchasing eco-friendly containers and packaging \u2013 36%\nProducing the product line in bulk batches \u2013 14%\nPurchasing essential business supplies (label printer, work tables, etc.) \u2013 11%\nExtras (shipping, t-shirts, marketing, etc.) \u2013 13%\nShipping anywhere inside the USA is free. International backers will be responsible for shipping fees and any applicable tariffs and/or customs fees.\nFive years ago, I got home from work one evening, walked straight into my bathroom and dumped all of my makeup and skincare into the trashcan. I was done with being a victim of the beauty industry.\nEarlier that day, I'd discovered that every single one of my regular beauty products\u2014the lotions, cleansers, shampoos, lip balms, and makeup brands I'd used and trusted for more than a decade\u2014 contained carcinogens.\nHow could a company release something known to cause cancer?\nI researched the topic further and learned the majority of skincare products on the market contain this type of thing \u2013 harsh chemicals and synthetics like parabens, phthalates, tricoloson, sodium laureth sulfate and more. They are skin irritants, endocrine disruptors, and carcinogens.\nCHECK OUT WHAT I DISCOVERED...\nBreastCancerFund.org: \u201cIn the U.S., major loopholes in federal law allow the cosmetics industry to put thousands of synthetic chemicals into personal care products, even if those chemicals are linked to cancer, infertility or birth defects.\u201d \nNaturalNews.com: \u201cCommon, brand-name skin care products often contain multiple chemical contaminants known to cause cancer, liver disorders and neurological disorders.\u201d \u2013 \nHuffingtonPost.com: \u201cParabens possess estrogen-mimicking properties that are associated with increased risk of breast cancer. These chemicals are absorbed through the skin and have been identified in biopsy samples from breast tumors. They can be found in makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facial cleansers.\u201d \u2013 \nEnvironmental Working Group: \"One of every five adults is potentially exposed every day to all of the top seven carcinogenic impurities common to personal care product ingredients.\"  \nLivestrong.com: \u201cMethylparaben is used as a fragrance and as a preservative ingredient in skin care products, according to the Skin Deep Cosmetic Database. It is toxic to non-reproductive organs in the human body and may cause cancer, skin irritation, neurotoxicity and may disrupt endocrine function.\u201d  \nBeing Beautiful Shouldn't Kill You\nThe majority of skincare products on the market should come with an overt Surgeon General's warning on the front like cigarettes.\nBut they don't. And they probably never will.\nSo it's up to each of us to learn the risks involved with using these products and find a better solution for ourselves.\nLove Your Face is that solution.\nAfter throwing away my entire beauty regimen, I made it my mission to find products that would work in harmony with my body and not against it. You shouldn't have to risk your health to look and feel beautiful.\nWhen Laurel Met Kate\nWhen I met Kate years later, I discovered that as an aesthetician, she'd been on the same quest to find natural products for herself and her clients. We immediately bonded over our shared passion.\nWhile Kate and I were having coffee one day, the idea for Love Your Face was born. Instead of continuing to search high and low for natural products that met our high standards, we decided to create our own.\nSo that's exactly what we did. But it didn't stop at a skincare line...\nFrom the moment we came up with the idea for Love Your Face, we wanted our mission to be more than just healthy beauty products.

But Google hasn\u2019t built an app for Gmail on the desktop like it has on iOS and Android.\nApps like Outlook and Mail wipe away all the unique power of Gmail, leaving many of us to do on the desktop what we\u2019d never want to do on our phones - use it in the browser, buried in the chaos of web browsing.\nWe\u2019d dreamed of turning Gmail into a powerful, fluid email client that not only makes Gmail easier to use, but goes way beyond and makes a beautiful statement about what email itself could be like.\nAfter 18 months, it\u2019s now almost here. We just need your help to launch.\nIn building a humanized email client, we wanted to acknowledge basic truths -- like that many of us have more than one Gmail account (personal, school, work, etc). We wanted you to avoid having to sign in over and over every time you close your browser or restart your computer, and we wanted it to work all the time, flawlessly.\nGoogle has struggled to make this work well at all in the browser, where you frequently get signed out at random and generally have a poor experience. We spent months developing and refining a new technology that allows it to \"just work\" work all the time, without sign-ins or typing or any extra effort on your part. \nUSE YOUR EMAIL WITHOUT BEING BURIED BY IT\nA huge piece of what we wanted to do with Gmail for Mac was to radically simplify the effort and \"cognitive burden\" of using your email. It's something we do all day long, all the time, and it should be as easy as breathing. \nWe've made radical new ways - entirely unique to our client - for filtering out the noise of email alerts and unread counts that come at you all day long. We've also honed the user experience so that nearly everything you do constantly can be reached in a single click or gesture (navigating your email, writing a new message, opening your inbox, etc). This is the kind of iOS-like focus & simplicity that has liberated us all on mobile. We wanted to do that for email on the desktop. \nAND...\nSIMPLE. POWERFUL. BEAUTIFUL.\nThe difference between using Gmail in the browser and Gmail in our streamlined and powerful app is enormous, and ultimately one we feel will make your email life easier and more friendly. \nMore Details\nABOUT US\nThe guys behind Zive are Eric Shashoua and Ryan Shetley, but we've been joined by an amazing team of designers and developers who share the same idealistic dream of beautiful, simple, and obsessively designed software. We believed we could make a real difference in some of the tools people use most often by making them beautiful, seamless, and effortless on a level that\u2019s encountered too seldomly outside of Apple. We wanted to build a company where the work itself mattered more to us than the bottom line or any traditional goal of business. And ... we wanted it to be human. \nOur team brings to Zive 10+ years of experience designing and developing software and consumer electronics, as well as developing for iOS and the Mac. As the former CEO / Co-Founder of Zeo, Inc., Eric raised $14M in venture funding and had a chance to work with the leaders of Bose and iRobot in learning how to design products that are truly focused on the user. Zeo\u2019s products have been marketed and sold throughout the US and Europe, and have led to being called out to Cupertino in connection with being featured in Apple Stores. Ryan brings to our bold and scrappy team a novel approach to technology, where engineering effort is focused intensely on the user experience rather than the usual product development approach. The rest of our team consists of awesome and intensely passionate designers, a couple artists, and folks who've spent years developing for and falling madly in love with the Mac.  \nDisclaimer: Though we love Gmail and we love the Mac, Zive is not affiliated in any way with either Google nor Apple and is an independent third party. Gmail for Mac, by Zive, is a product made entirely by Zive, Inc. and no other company. \nWe need your help! Where the funds go:\nWe already have a polished alpha, but we've started this Kickstarter to get to launch. What that means:\nBeta testing phase before launch\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite upgrade completion\nPossible Inbox by Google integration\nCommunity to help us test, give feedback, and ... well, we just think you guys would be awesome even if you do none of that. \nMarketing funding to help get the word out at launch\nSo, we're after supporters, a few enthusiastic folks to help us beta test, and launch funding to help kick off the product launch. Please join us and become a part of our bold dream to elevate Gmail to a whole new level!\nFor your support of us, we've lined up what we think would be really great rewards for anyone who joins on -- starting with a copy of the full version of Gmail for Mac! Take a look at our rewards right on this page!\nAnd thank you for supporting Gmail for Mac, by Zive!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile most kickstarters launch with a concept or prototype, we feel that most of the risk in our project has already been mitigated by having moved far beyond that stage to an alpha version of Gmail for Mac, by Zive. \n\nLaunch Timing: With any software development, there are potential risks in unforeseen variables causing delays in launch. While this is always a possibility, we don't expect this to play a significant role given the stage we're at. We have already made a tremendously detailed effort to create a streamlined and extremely reliable application. \n\nWe feel confident that we could launch Gmail for Mac not long after the conclusion of our Kickstarter. \n\nExperience: We've done this before successfully a few times over, and our team has extensive experience designing, building, and selling software through Apple's app and retail stores. \n\nThis is the only project we are running, and has the undivided attention of our team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Thomas Horne", "content": "What a poor way to treat backers having us email in to hopefully recieve a key.", "time": "about 3 years ago"}, {"username": "Nicholas Llewellyn-Jones", "content": "Thanks", "time": "over 3 years ago"}, {"username": "Kiran Jonnalagadda", "content": "I've emailed you folks a day after this update (on May 2) and still haven't heard back.", "time": "about 4 years ago"}, {"username": "Mark", "content": "My copy has ceased to work as well.

When Lizzie and Brad got engaged in 2011, Lizzie learned that to accomplish this, she had to either use inadequate ring holders or keep the ring on her finger. These options did not satisfy or comfort Lizzie's worries of losing or damaging her ring while cooking in the kitchen and working and cleaning around the house. She needed something better and we knew there were many others like her who needed something better too.\nAnd so we created The Blingnet, a patent pending piece of awesomeness! When we began creating the Blingnet, we set out to make a jewelry holder that was convenient, easy to use, and capable of protecting precious bling in high risk areas like kitchens, bathrooms, and anywhere else.\nClick to learn more about the creators!\nAlright so it's a no brainer, a ring holder must provide safety for a ring. For us, convenience was equally as important. We didn't want to use an old jewelry box or dainty figurine stand or ring dish; those options cause clutter and, to us, are largely inconvenient and unsafe when used. \nWe wanted something different. We wanted a magnet! Something that could magnetize to the fridge, to the stove, to the washer and dryer, and anywhere else we desired!\nIt had to be mobile. It needed to be readily available and quickly accessible before we got our hands dirty prepping some raw chicken for dinner, began a load of laundry, or simply washed our hands or face at the sink.\nOur first drawings and discussions of the Blingnet ring holder started in January of 2012. We built a complicated first prototype in Brad's parents' garage and quickly learned what worked and what didn't. We doodled and daddled a lot, we researched, we googled, we prototyped and then we did that process over again some umpteen times. \nIn 2013, we filed for a Trademark and a Patent with the USPTO and worked to get the Blingnet prepared for the masses. In 2014, our goal is to share our idea and our passion with everyone and start getting the Blingnet into homes all over the world.\nWe want your input!\nYou want more color options right?

We are confident that, as we get ready to begin manufacturing the Blingnet, we are prepared to over come any new challenges.\n\nPreparations are in place to use a local manufacturer in Arizona, Icon Injection Molding, who will provide the mold for the Blingnet and produce the Blingnet for the masses. They have been great to work with and we know working with them will allow us to bring the Blingnet to life. Once our campaign has been funded we will have the funds to issue the go ahead to get our mold produced and our first batch of Blingnets. We've been told and expect the turnaround time to be 2-3 months.\n\nWe've already received our first order of magnets which will take care of our first batch of Blingnets in order to fulfill our KickStarter rewards.\n\nAs far as shipping goes, Brad worked for four years at a UPS Store while he went through college and is quite the shipping and packaging expert.

After building a career in fashion as a merchandiser in London and Milan I moved to China as part of my quest to get closer to the product. While managing factories and later launching and growing my own e-commerce business in China, I was vividly confronted with fashion\u2019s impact on people and planet and I didn\u2019t like what I saw.\nWhen my wife, had the opportunity to fulfill her dream to go to graduate school in the US, I came along for the ride. I found myself in Durham, North Carolina as she\u2019s studying environmental management at Duke.\nWhile immersing myself in reading and conversations on the environmental impact of fashion, I realized its approach to sustainability is simply not scientific enough. I founded Constant Simplicity with the goal of changing that.\nSCIENTIFIC APPROACH\nWe teamed up with researches from Duke University to take decision-making in fashion to the next level. We design, source and produce to the highest possible quality and base all of our decisions on an analysis of the environmental impact of each fabric, component and stitch. We use a tool called Life Cycle Assessment to help us make the best decisions in terms of sourcing and manufacturing, and make it a point to know everything we can about the people involved in making our clothes. This way we can offer our customers complete transparency in our supply chain and ensure the minimum possible impact in terms of resources and people.  \nOUR REWARDS:\nTHE T-SHIRT IN DETAILS:\nWe wanted a t-shirt that can be basic and casual but go well with a jacket and help you stay comfortable and smart altogether. Double needle stitch across the shoulders helps reinforce the area with the greatest friction on a t-shirt.\nThe bamboo rayon fabric has very soft properties and drapes very easily on the body.\nTHE POLO & POLO DRESS IN DETAILS\nCOLLAR\nOur collar is a modern cut collar. 2 inch cut at the perfect angle. It is a Banded collar - a standing band-shaped collar that encircles the neck. This is a true sign of premium polo shirts. Most brands try to reduce their costs and avoid the more complex construction required for a banded collar on a polo shirt. It reinforces the collar, makes it last longer, helps it \u201csit\u201d better and just looks so much better.\nPLACKET\nWe feel that a 3 buttons polo shirt is the best choice for comfort and style for men. For the ladies we designed a 5 buttons placket, the long placket is a great visual bonus for a basic item but it also helps increase comfort and increased styling options for ladies of all shapes and sizes.\nSEAT\nPolos are meant for active men. We added what is known as a \u201ctennis tail\u201d \u2013 meaning there is a small oppening at the bottom of the shirt with the back being \u00bd an inch longer. This is a wonderful feature that allows you to have more freedom in movement.\nSLIT\nThe polo dress has a 3.5 inch long slit. A small detail but it gives you great freedom in movement, no matter you shape and size.\nPOCKET\nWe love the pocket on the polo shirt for men. It is small but not too small. At 3 \u00bd inch in its widest point (horizontally) and 4 \u00bd inch at its longest point (vertically) it is modern and functional.\nBUTTONS\nOur buttons are 100% natural made from coconuts. They are of a natural tan color and we especially chose them to be 0.6 inch in diameter. This is only slightly larger than average but helps compliment the colors of the collection. The buttons are made in Panama, the coconut is from Ecuador. Dyeing is done with all natural, non-toxic, biodegradable dyes. Our supplier takes pride in producing a sustainable safe and beautiful product.\nSLEEVES\nThe sleeves are reinforced at the armband with a turned over finish. This reinforces the sleeve at the point where it bears most of the friction and helps accentuate a more pronounced style.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe spent most of the past year working with our team and partners to develop the first samples of the bamboo collection. We spent countless hours researching and designing the best supply chain and working hard on reducing the environmental impact and finding the best partners to work with.\n\nSCALE\nTo be able to offer our premium collection at affordable prices we have to reach high production minimums. Often with kickstarter projects scaling up due to high demand can be a problem. We worked hard to ensure that we are able handle small and very high demand alike. \n\nPARTNERS\nWe hand picked each partner across the chain of supply to try and reduce potential problems. They all share our vision and are working hard with us to deliver the best product possible.\n\nSHIPPING AND CUSTOMS\nThis is normally the dread of new fashion brands. Luckily we have a rich experience and have chosen our logistics partners in advance to minimize any potential problems and try to deliver the goods in the fastest manner possible.\n\nTRACEABILITY AND QUALITY\nWe promise to inspect and follow each step of the production to ensure the best product possible is delivered.\n\nA PROMISE\nWe are not here just to make a great product. How it is made, who makes it, under which conditions and a scientific measure of each step is what we are about. This is what we promise and what we will deliver.

Every time you pull your earbuds out of your pocket, purse, or backpack, you waste time untangling. Thirty seconds of frustration each time, totaling 5 hours per year solving a Rubik's cube like puzzle (Your mileage may vary). Yes, not one of life's bigger problems - just an annoying, everyday problem faced by most earbuds users. And it has not been solved well - until now.\nWe tried the other cord organizers, but we wanted a widget that was:\n1. Small. Small enough to stay unobtrusively attached on the cord so it's always available and you can't misplace.\n2. Simple. Minimal design with no fasteners, like Velcro or magnets, that might fasten to stuff in your pocket. \n3. Fast. Quick release of your stored earbuds. No missed calls due to time consuming unwinding.\nIn short, Budsband is the smallest, simplest, fastest way to store your earbuds tangle-free, and more. Budsband is a simple, silicone band organizer that enables you to neatly wrap and compactly band the cord so it will stay tangle-free.\nIt is designed to stay attached to your cord so it's always there when you need it. The unique Budsband fastener-free design uses the earbuds' plug to secure the cord tangle-free. To store your earbuds, simply wrap them into a bundle, stretch the band around the bundle and secure the end with the earbuds\u2019 plug (see picture \"worth lots of words\" below). To use your stored earbuds, simply unband for quick access.\nAlso, Budsband can shorten your cords to a desired length and it is so light it will not interfere with your listening. And it can tether your earbuds to zippers or buttons to keep the cord retained. Retention of cords is important to prevent the weight of the cords from pulling the earbuds out of your ears while exercising. Plus, it is a convenient way to hold your earbuds hands-free when you take a break from listening.\nIt is the first organizer that does not use a plastic spool or fasteners, thereby making it smaller, simpler and faster.\n1. Attaches to the cord unobtrusively. Always available when needed. Budsband is designed to stay on the cord, unlike other organizers, which are easily misplaced. It's so small and light you won't know it is there. It's the smallest and lightest organizer available.\n2. Simple, compact, tangle-free organization. Budsband stores your earbuds in a compact bundle that makes it easy to slip in your pocket, purse or gym bag. It is 2-10 times smaller than the others. The compact and simple, fastener-free design lessens the likelihood of your earbuds getting entangled with other stuff, like keys.\n3. Fast access to your earbuds  - unband, no unwinding. When you get an incoming phone call, you don\u2019t have time to unwind. Unlike other organizers, Budsband makes accessing your stored earbuds super fast. \nWait, there\u2019s more it can do\u2026..\nShortens cords. Sometimes you want the cord shortened. Simply bundle the portion to shorten and wrap it with Budsband. Since the band is elastic, it keeps the smaller bundle secure.\nTethers to retain cord. The dangling cord can be get in the way of your listening. It can snag on other objects or the weight of the cord can pull the earbuds out of your ears, especially while jogging. By tethering the hole on Budsband to a suitable object on your clothing \u2013 such as a zipper or button \u2013Budsband solves this problem. Plus, it is a convenient way to hold your earbuds hands-free when you take a break from listening. Obviously, this feature has a drawback; you need an object to tether to - a t-shirt won't work. \nWorks on Apple\u2019s iPhone 5 and 6 Lightning charging cables. It keeps your charging cord neat, compact and organized. It is a bit harder to slide over the plug the first time, but doable. And you only need to attach it once. Worth the attachment pain. (NOTE: Works on Apple; off-brands may have bigger plug housing and it may not fit)\nWorks on standard 3.5mm earbuds. Whatever style or brand of earbuds, Budsband should fit. While we have not tested every single brand, as long as it can fit over the plug to attach to the cord, it will work.\nAfter the close of the Kickstarter campaign, we will send a survey to you to select your colors. We ship in two packs so you need to pick colors in sets of two of the same color.\nBudsband is designed to stay on the cord so it is always there when you need it. So you need to attach it only once. To attach, thread the plug through the two adjacent holes in the enlarged end starting with the hole adjacent the band portion. Position Budsband on the cord right next to the plug's plastic housing. \nPLAY\n\nAfter the one-time attaching Budsband to the cord, it is 3 fast steps:\nIf you watched the above video, you saw just how fast and easy it is. Trust us, we're lying. The first time, it is not that smooth, like tying your shoes the first time wasn't. But after a couple times, you will get it down. And there is no right way to do it. Just bundle, wrap, secure and Budsband will do the job.\n Sometimes, the simplest solution is the best.\nHere's one of our concepts for packaging. Each package contains 2 Budsbands in the same color. Expect changes as we fine tune.\nNote that Budsbands will ship in a great looking retail package of 2 Budsbands. Use one for your earbuds and the other for your charging cable (iPhone 5, Lightning), or give it to a family member. Budsband makes the perfect gift for anyone with earbuds, so stock up and save even more.\n As you can see, we have done everything we can on our own to get the product refined, tested and ready for production. Now, we just need you.\nThe above photo shows a few of our hand-made prototypes. All produced without slicing a finger, despite the combination of beer and sharp blades.\nReady for Production. Manufacturer selected, production mold built, sample parts made. Finding the right supplier has taken months. We are working with an experienced, high quality manufacturer that works with many brand name companies. They are U.S. based (fewer communication issues) and own overseas manufacturing facilities. We have met personally with the owner. The company can produce everything we need: the tooling, the parts, the packaging and assemble the parts into the package. Plus, they ship the finished products via air freight to our door.\nTo test their quality and responsiveness, we already had them make a mold and run sample parts for our functional testing. We are confident that they can produce the quantity and high quality of parts we require. \nProducing actual molded parts has been invaluable to test the design since there is not a way to 3D print with silicone. We intended to make a prototype mold and make the production mold after the Kickstarter project finished, but the production mold was the same price as a prototype one. We have refined the design twice for the production tool to make it even easier to use and this means you will get your rewards even sooner since we spared you 2 design iterations.\nWe have conducted testing on the molded samples with many users (no LD50 tests were needed). Budsband works well on the variety of earbuds we tested. Plus, it is very strong and stretchable with a finish that feels even better than it looks.\nGood Widget Company makes innovative products so simple that you will smile.\nGood Widget Company is an Ann Arbor, Michigan based company started by an experienced entrepreneur, Ed Farrell, and a professional graphic designer, Kevin Ryan. We have extensive background in bringing new products to market as an entrepreneur and as a graphic designer bringing other entrepreneurs' dreams to reality. Ed is the founder of CrowdJuice, a mobile event guide and networking app for professional conferences. Previously, he co-founded CareerSite Corporation, a pioneering Internet company, that combined software and business model innovation to change the way recruiting was done. Kevin\u2019s day job is for Alfajango.com where he helps entrepreneurs build their startups.\nWe have self-funded everything to this point, including  tooling, to get the product's design refined and ready for production, but we need your help for the following significant costs:\nProduct tooling modifications\nProduction of Budsbands at scale to achieve lower costs\nPackaging tooling and production\nOverseas air shipping to get parts here quickly\nShipping rewards\nUnited States and International Patents Pending.\nCaution: Choking hazard.

For this project we have significant \"skin in the game\" in both dollars and time. We have worked really hard to minimize product and manufacturing risks so that we can deliver a great product according to the timeline. We have an aggressive timeline and it is possible for it to slip if we encounter significant, unforeseen problems in manufacturing. If we encounter any issues that will impact our timeline, we will communicate with you in a timely fashion. If any of the risks will cause you to lose sleep at night, you should not back this or any other Kickstarter project. We want you to smile and not sleeping may adversely affect your ability to smile. Here are the risks we see:\n\nMANUFACTURING\nThe biggest risk in product design projects is making and delivering the product according to the timeline, so we wanted to lessen that risk. We have selected and met with a quality supplier with brand name customers that can make the mold, run parts in high quantities, print the packaging and assembly and ship the parts to us. They are U.S. based with overseas manufacturing facilities. We have already made the mold to run sample parts. The photos of the white Budsband are actual production mold versions. Since they have already made our parts with the mold, we are confident they can make quality parts. We have not made the product in colors yet, but we are fairly confident our supplier can deliver these without significant issues. We plan to begin begin testing colors once we hit the goal so we are ready once the campaign ends. Delays due to unforeseen problems are still possible though; we will let you know if they occur. Order fulfillment and shipping to you will begin as soon as we receive the product by air from the manufacturer.\n\nAPOCALYPSE\nGranted, this one is not likely, but we are thorough. Unfortunately, we fear we will be among those left behind; however, this is good for you if you are still around, since we will make a \"good faith\" effort to get your Budsband delivered. And we're guessing you will need to use your earbuds more than ever in such a situation. If you are among the lucky ones, you won't need your earthly stuff anyway so we hope you won't have a way to contact a lawyer - on the remote chance there are any left behind with us.

I'm an independent journalist based in Washington, D.C., and the author of Green Is The New Red: An Insider\u2019s Account of a Social Movement Under Siege. I am also a 2014 TED Fellow. \nMy work focuses on animal rights and environmental issues, and civil liberties post 9/11. It has been featured in the world\u2019s top media outlets, including the Washington Post, NPR, Rolling Stone, Foreign Policy, and El Pais. I've testified before the U.S. Congress about my reporting, and I've lectured at nearly 200 universities and public forums about my work, including Harvard Law School, Georgetown University, and the House of Democracy and Human Rights in Berlin. \nI have extensively documented how protest and whistleblowing is being criminalized. Now, in my new project, I am going to use new investigative journalism tools to help expose what some corporations want to keep hidden.\nPhotographer Mishka Henner documented factory farm pollution\u2014like this waste lagoon at a Texas feedlot\u2014by satellite. What else could drone photography uncover?\nFactory Farms Want to Keep You in the Dark\nA wave of undercover investigations by groups like the Humane Society have exposed shocking cruelty on factory farms: cows being kicked in the face, turkeys beaten with pipes, and chickens packed in filthy cages so small they cannot even flap a wing. This whistleblowing has prompted the largest meat recall in U.S. history and multiple criminal prosecutions. Rather than address these abuses, though, the agriculture industry is trying to hide them from consumers. \nNew \"ag-gag\" laws make it illegal to photograph animal cruelty on factory farms; in some cases, exposing cruelty can lead to more jail time than committing it. These bills have already become law in Utah, Iowa, Missouri, and Idaho. Right now, more states are considering them, and they are spreading globally. The agriculture industry in Australia is modeling its \"ag-gag\" laws after those in the states. \nThe latest trend is that the agriculture industry is even trying to ban photographs of farms taken from the air. It is unlikely that aerial photography can document animal abuse, but these industries are clearly concerned. So what are factory farms trying to hide? Will a drone allow us to see the scope of pollution caused by these industrial operations? I'm going to find out... \nLet's Shine a Light\nAs a journalist, I think the best way to confront these attempts at secrecy is to shine a light on the abuses.\nWith your support, I will:\nLawfully document factory farms in multiple states using aerial drone photography.\nCreate a short documentary about factory farms and the \"ag-gag\" controversy using aerial drone footage, and interviews with whistleblowers.\nPublish an e-book that combines these photographs with in-depth investigative reporting on factory farms and \"ag-gag\" legislation.  \nUse the investigation to contribute to public debate about \"ag-gag\" laws internationally.\nBrief media and policymakers about the findings of my investigation \nShare what I have learned about using drones for reporting with other journalists and professional journalism associations.\nPlus offer some fun, unique perks to say THANK YOU for supporting investigative journalism!\n\"Ag-gag\" laws are an attempt to silence whistleblowers who have exposed cruelty, like this injured and neglected piglet on a farm in Iowa.\nWhy Me? \nI've reported extensively on these attempts to silence investigators and whistleblowers, both in my award-winning book and news articles. My work on \"ag-gag\" has been featured by Salon, MSN, Democracy Now, VICE, Al Jazeera, and many other outlets.\nMy reporting overturned the first \"ag-gag\" prosecution.\nI have lectured internationally about these laws, including Spain and Australia. And I spoke about my reporting as a TED Fellow. \nI am a plaintiff in the first lawsuits challenging an \"ag-gag\" law as unconstitutional. My position is supported by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and 16 other professional journalism organizations.\nI'm independent. My background is reporting for major newspapers, but by working independently I can report critically without having to answer to advertisers.\nHow Will Your Kickstarter Contribution Be Used?\nMajor costs associated with this investigation include:\nAerial photography equipment. (Please note that while there are some new consumer drones available for a few hundred dollars, they will not meet the technical demands of this project, including range of travel.)\nTravel expenses (for Will Potter, videographer, and assistant) to multiple states and rural locations. This includes airfare, car rental, gas, food, and research expenses.\nLegal counsel. In order to ensure the investigation is lawful and protected, we will need to consult with attorneys in multiple states. \nVideo production and equipment.\nWebsite development.\nE-book production and publication.\nFees (Kickstarter has a 5% fee, plus Amazon has a 5% credit card fee).\nOther Ways You Can Help\nI hope you will support this critical project, in whatever way you can! If you cannot make a financial contribution, please consider:\nSigning my Change.org petition against \"ag-gag\" laws. \nSubscribing to my email action list for the latest news on this issue.\nSharing this Kickstarter with your friends on Facebook, and starting a discussion about what factory farms are trying to hide.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause an investigation like this hasn't been attempted before, I cannot make any guarantee of what I will be able to document.

I am accustomed to pushing through setbacks and detours in the course of my reporting, and I am confident that I will be able to do the same with this project.

To download a free PDF, buy print copies, or anything else, please visit www.leannebrown.ca/cookbooks.\nThis page is now frozen until the end of time, but to see what the page looked like while the Kickstarter campaign was still active, read on!\n-----\nGood and Cheap is a gorgeous cookbook for tight budgets. It's free online, but let's get it out to more people by funding a print run.\nYou can already download a PDF for free on my website at www.leannebrown.ca/cookbooks. Thanks to the support of a bunch of awesome strangers on Reddit, on Tumblr, and elsewhere, it's been amazingly popular \u2014 over 200,000 people have downloaded the draft version!\nBut I want your help to fund printed copies so that we can get Good and Cheap into the hands of people who don't have computers or who wouldn't otherwise see it. The expensive part of printing books is the initial set-up; the cost of each additional copy is fairly low. The more books you buy, the more I can donate or sell at a massive discount to organizations that support low-income families on SNAP (the modern name for Food Stamps).\nWhat's the book like?\nJust download a free PDF and take a look for yourself! But since you asked, it's 132 pages (so far!) of beautifully designed and photographed recipes that fit into a $4/day budget \u2014 without seeming like it. This is good food that happens to be inexpensive.\nIf you downloaded the book when it first when viral, grab a new copy: the earlier version was just a draft, but the final version of Good and Cheap has been edited and redesigned throughout.\nWhat's your plan?\nI want this book to be as accessible as possible. That's why I've made it free online, and nearly 200,000 downloads to date proves there is both a willing audience and a need.\nMy dream is that everyone who could benefit from this book would be able to get a copy, at whatever price they can afford. For many, that means keeping it free \u2014 even in printed form.\nBecause printed books cost money, a scheme was born: $25 buys one copy for you and a second copy that I'll donate to someone who needs it.\nOnce I reach my goal, I'll approach organizations to figure out who to entrust with getting these books into the hands of low-income families and individuals. I hope to be able to work with a variety of organizations for the greatest reach.\nWhere'd this come from?\nI created this cookbook as the capstone project for my master's degree in Food Studies at NYU. I wanted to make something that not only summed up the work I had done during my studies, but also had a useful life outside of academia.\nIt bothered me that so many ideas for fixing the food system leave out the poor: it seemed like they didn't have a voice in the food movement. I wanted to create a resource that would promote the joy of cooking and show just how delicious and inspiring a cheap meal can be if you cook it yourself.\nEven though Food Stamps help millions of people across the United States every day, benefits were reduced in November despite rising food prices. It's more important than ever to make the most of what you have with savvy shopping techniques and skillful cooking. That's Good and Cheap.\nStretch goals!\nIf we reach $145,000:\nTWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 6,300+ donated copies so far). And I will do five cartwheels.\nIf we reach $143,210 (GOOOOOOOOAL!):\nI will make good and (relatively) cheap celebratory sangria and share the recipe with all of you!\nIf we reach $142,500 (STAGGERING!):\nTWENTY-SIX THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 6,200+ donated copies so far). And I will watch Beverly Hills Cop III.\nIf we reach $140,000 (COWABUNGA!):\nTWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 6,100+ donated copies so far). And I will make smiley-face pancakes!\nIf we reach $135,000 (GREAT SCOTT!):\nTWENTY-FOUR THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 5,900+ donated copies so far). And I will jump for joy!\nIf we reach $130,000 (WHAT THE WHAT???!):\nTWENTY-THREE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 5,700+ donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $125,000 (INCONCEIVABLE!):\nTWENTY-TWO THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 5,500+ donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $120,000 (BANANAS!):\nTWENTY-ONE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 5,300+ donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $115,000 (!!!):\nTWENTY THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 5,100+ donated copies so far).   \nIf we reach $110,000 (STUNNING!):\nNINETEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 4,900+ donated copies so far).  \nIf we reach $105,000 (TRANSCENDENT!):\nEIGHTEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 4,700+ donated copies so far). \nIf we reach $100,000 (UNREAL!):\nSEVENTEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 4,400+ donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $95,000 (GADZOOKS!):\nSIXTEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 4,200+ donated copies so far).  \nIf we reach $90,000 (CRAZY!):\nFIFTEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 4,000+ donated copies so far). \nIf we reach $85,000 (SPECTACULAR!):\nFOURTEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 3,800+ donated copies so far). \nIf we reach $80,000 (MAGNIFICENT!):\nTHIRTEEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 3,600+ donated copies so far).  \nIf we reach $75,000 (UNBELIEVABLE!):\nTWELVE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 3,400+ donated copies so far). \nIf we reach $70,000 (TERRIFIC!):\nELEVEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $65,000 (ZOUNDS!):\nTEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $60,000 (MIND-BLOWING!):\nNINE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $55,000 (ASTOUNDING!):\nEIGHT THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $50,000 (INCREDIBLE!):\nSEVEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $45,000 (WOW!):\nSIX THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $40,000 (RUNNING OUT OF HYPERBOLE!):\nFIVE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $35,000 (AMAZING!):\nFOUR THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $30,000 (DONE LIKE DINNER!):\nLet's keep doing this! I'll print 1,000 more copies of Good and Cheap and offer them to worthwhile organizations at $4 per copy (plus cheap media-mail shipping). That's THREE THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL (in addition to the donated copies so far).\nIf we reach $25,000 (BAM! POW! BIFF!):\nThat last one happened so quickly, I haven't had time to think up a new stretch goal, so let's do the last one again! I'll print 1,000 more copies of Good and Cheap and offer them to worthwhile organizations at $4 per copy (plus cheap media-mail shipping).\nIf we reach $20,000 (AND WE DID!):\nI'll print 1,000 more copies of Good and Cheap and offer them to worthwhile organizations at $4 per copy (plus cheap media-mail shipping). I've already spoken casually to a couple of organizations that think they can make that plan work. I'll let others know how to get in touch soon.\nIf we reach $15,000 (ACHIEVED!):\nOn behalf of all of you, I will donate another 250 copies of Good and Cheap to worthwhile organizations. That's on top of the copies that new backers will be donating on the way to $15,000!\nI will open up 4 more \"sponsor a recipe\" rewards at $100 each (total 20).

We are both seniors in high school and we\u2019ve been best friends since the very first day of kindergarten. Zach is a singer-songwriter and guitar player who was 1 of 12 songwriters selected to participate in the Los Angeles GRAMMY Camp this past summer. Riley is Zach\u2019s manager and an aspiring music industry professional.\nToday we are here to ask for your support for something that is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity. If we reach our fundraising goal, we will be able to go down to LA to record a 6 song EP with LA producer Mark Mazzetti, who\u2019s worked with artists including John Mayer, Janet Jackson, Elton John, and Sting!\nIt's always been our dream to professionally record Zach's music. This is our chance to reach out to others and share his songs with the world. We are so excited for this project and we really hope that you can be a part of it and help make it happen.\nCheck out one of Zach's songs and the rest of his EP on his Soundcloud below!\nAbout the Project:\nTwo months ago we met Mark Mazzetti at the West Coast Songwriters Conference in Los Altos Hills, CA. We gave Mark one of Zach\u2019s CDs and our contact information, not expecting to hear back from him. But just a week later we got a call from Mark saying saying he liked Zach\u2019s music and wanted to record it! \nWe\u2019ve been working together with Mark over the past month and a half to put together a detailed plan and budget for a 6 song EP that we can share with a broader audience.  Now we just need the funding to make it happen.\nIf we reach our goal on Kickstarter, this February we will both be traveling to LA for 10 days to record an EP in one of Mark\u2019s studios.  All the Kickstarter funds will go directly to recording and producing of this EP, and we will be covering all travel costs ourselves.\n Zach will be singing and playing guitar and other very talented musicians will be brought in for the drums, bass, piano, backup vocals, etc. Riley will be managing the fundraising, promotion, and press for the EP. *Please note, Riley will not be playing on the record (oh thank goodness!).\nZach and Riley\u2019s parents will be handling the money itself and overseeing the project, and Mark Mazzetti will be in charge of spending budget for the EP when we\u2019re in the studio.\nOur Story: \nWe\u2019ve been best friends since the very first day of kindergarten.\nThe story goes we both reached for the same graham cracker at the same time. We made eye contact, and at that moment, Riley knew Zach was going somewhere big. Right then and there, before Zach even could even fully sign his own name, Riley signed Zach onto a 12 year contract.\nSince that day, we\u2019ve been best friends.  Throughout high school, we\u2019ve been working closely together as a duo\u2013Zach as the musician and Riley as the manager. We\u2019ve always dreamed of working together on a big project, and this is finally our chance. It\u2019s our final year of high school and we\u2019re so excited to have the opportunity to do something really big.\nTeam Zach Gospe:\nThe Talent - Zach Gospe:\nI began my music career at age five, learning piano, drums, bass guitar, and finally settling on guitar. Influenced by music from John Mayer, Eric Clapton, and U2, I began to dive into the world of songwriting as my vocal and guitar skills increased. Now that my abilities as a writer and musician have grown tremendously, recording a studio EP is the next clear step for me. I am truly excited to have this opportunity to develop my musicianship even further and send my music out into the world.\nThe Guy Behind the Scenes - Riley Soward \nI think that Zach's music is magical and I want to share his songs with the world. As Zach\u2019s manager, I\u2019ve been in charge of organizing his concerts/recording sessions/music videos, promoting his music, and networking with important people in the music business. In addition to being Zach\u2019s manager, I\u2019ve gained insight into the industry through my internship with blues-rock singer-songwriter David Jacobs-Strain. The music industry is such an exciting industry to be a part of and I hope we get this opportunity to record Zach's songs in the best way possible. If we do, we will be able to spread the magic I hear in Zach's music to the rest of the world.\nThe Producer - Mark Mazzetti \nWe are so lucky to have Mark Mazzetti on our team (he\u2019s worked with a lot of successful musicians, including Elton John, John Mayer, Sting, and Janet Jackson!). Before we go down to LA, Mark will be doing artist development sessions with Zach to help him develop the songs for the EP. Once we\u2019re in the studio, he will be producing the entire album\u2013this means overseeing all aspects of recording, mixing and mastering. Mark has had quite a successful career and has 20+ years of record production, mixing & co-mastering experience. He has been a driving creative force behind multi-Platinum, Grammy Award-winning records and we are really excited about his vision for the EP.\nThe Adults Making It Happen: Mary Gospe and Mike Gospe\nZach\u2019s parents, Mary Gospe and Mike Gospe will be overseeing the Kickstarter project, managing funds and ensuring the fulfillment of rewards. Mary will accompany us to Los Angeles for the pre-production, recording and mixing sessions. Mary and Mike run their own company, Gospe Enterprises, Inc. and are co-founders and principals of KickStart Alliance, a marketing and sales consulting practice based in Silicon Valley, CA. If you have any questions about how the project is going to be executed, you can contact Mary at mary@gospe.com.\nThe Videographer: Nicole Falsetti\nWe are also very lucky to be working with our classmate and gifted videographer, Nicole Falsetti.  Nicole filmed and edited our Kickstarter video, and we will be teaming up with her to film a music video for one of the songs from the EP after it is released.\nWhere the Money is Going\nWe\u2019ve already gotten the money to cover the costs of food/transportation/hotels. Because of this, all the money we raise is going directly to the recording of the album itself.\nThe funds we raise will be used for:\n* Pre-production session\n* Master recording in a professional, digital recording studio\n* Hiring of professional, live musicians; recording engineer; mix engineer and mastering engineer\n* Mixing and mastering\nPlease note that our producer Mark Mazzetti will be in charge of the studio budget, not us.  Also note that you will only be charged if we reach our goal of $10,000.\nFinal Words\nWe are so excited about this project. It\u2019s always been our dream to work together on something like this, and now we have the opportunity. We have an amazing producer, we have the full team assembled, we have everything planned. All we need is the funding to carry out the project.\nWe really hope you consider investing in our project and in our careers.

That means, it's time for...\nWe'd like to tell you a little story about Bloom...\nOnce upon a time, there was this scrawny nerd named Joshua Voiles. \nOne night, after a lovely evening of guitar practice, he happened to stumble upon a super-tall, lanky kid who was playing the piano at a graduation ceremony. \nBut man, oh, man could this lanky kid sing! \nIn fact, his voice sent fluttery butterflies down Joshua's spine. \nWhen he was done playing, Joshua rushed up to the super-tall, lanky-kid and gently yelled in his face, \"DUDE, WE NEED TO MAKE SOME EARTH-SHAKING MUSIC TOGETHER!\" \n And lanky-boy enthusiastically replied, \"Sounds good. I'm Jeremy Finlay, by the way.\" \nSo they teamed up with a long-time friend and amazing musician, Wally Allred. This dude used to be featured on MySpace Karaoke just about every single week. No joke. He's just that good. \nTogether, they endeavored to write music that genuinely moved people and challenged them to learn, grow, and fulfill their true potential. \nSo, independent of a record-label, they cracked open their piggy banks, borrowed whatever they couldn't buy, and decided to produce an album. \nOnce they had 10 songs written, rehearsed, and ready to record, they crammed themselves into Wally and Joshua's motor carriages and made the 12-hour trek from Salt Lake City Utah to Portland Oregon. \nAnd that\u2019s where they hooked-up with the profoundly awesome Kris Crummett (recording engineer and producer extraordinaire) and with his assistance, they banged out their first album titled, \"Photosynthesis.\" (Kris really is boss\u2026) \nThen they got Mari's fantabulously-talented, childhood friend Sarah to do the artwork for them \u2013 and it turned out lovely. \nOnce the album was released, it sold hundreds of copies within the first few days! The boys were thrilled... \nPlus, their song, \"Fight For Greatness\" ended up being one of the very first playable tracks on the Rock Band 3 Video Game Network for XBOX and PlayStation 3. It was one of the first songs to feature PRO keys. \nIt was so rad to play their own tunes in a video game! \nBut then, just as things just started to get rolling for Bloom \u2013 tragedy struck! \nWally fell in love, got married, and went on a 6-month-long honeymoon in Costa Rica. (Who does that?!) \nSo Bloom kind of\u2026 well\u2026 just stopped blooming. \nJeremy went back to his job at a boring call center \u2013 taking customer service calls\u2026 and Joshua went back to writing. How's that for a happy ending? \nBut little did they know... something was brewing under the surface... \nMari - Unexpectedly Featured In DRUM! Magazine\nSome time ago, this lovely lady called Mari Voiles had stumbled upon the world-class drummer, Mike Portnoy. She saw a video of him completely killing it on a monster drum kit and it blew her away. \nEver since then, she dreamed of becoming an amazing drummer. But truth is, Mari just didn't believe in herself \u2013 she didn't think she could pull it off. So nothing really became of it. \n...Until Bloom broke up. \nMari was a big fan of Bloom\u2019s music \u2013 and when she heard they broke-up she thought, \u201cwhat a bummer\u2026\u201d But instead of just wallowing in disappointment, what it really did was light a fire in her, and she determined, \u201cI'm not gonna stand back and let this happen!\" \nThat\u2019s when she committed herself to learning Bloom's songs backwards and forwards on the drums. She practiced every day, hours upon hours, with a single goal in mind... reviving Bloom and becoming Bloom's drummer. \nBut every time she brought the idea of her playing for the band up, they kept shooting her down with all these lame reasons why it couldn't possibly work out. \nMari just used these rejection as more fuel for her fire. She didn\u2019t let their lame reasons discourage her. Instead, she just kept practicing. And eventually (after a lot of cajoling) Mari finally convinced them to just TRY it... just sit with her and jam some Bloom songs. \nAnd guess what? \nShe freaking killed it! \nIn fact, it turns out, Mari was exactly what Bloom needed.  She was the swift kick in our heart's ass that got us to start playing music again. \nAnd to top it all off, there\u2019s even more good news: Wally flew back to the states, and re-joined Bloom... but this time he\u2019s ripping up the bass guitar! \nExcited to be living the Bloom life again, we went straight to work. \nJoshua wrote a song called, \"The Fault In Our Stars\", inspired by the best-selling author John Green.  We posted it on YouTube in support of one of our favorite charities, and have since raised $895.93 (and counting!) \nJohn Green's brother, Hank Green, shared it on his Tumblr, and more and more people started paying attention to us.\nIn fact, even though he almost certainly doesn't realize it and it's more just a funny story to share than anything else - Bloom's music even got heard by the top-grossing actor, Tom Hanks when he watched and shared Joshua's video review about Cloud Atlas on his Facebook and Twitter:\nYES!\nBut since then, we've had hundreds of people sharing with us the impact our music has made in their lives, along with loads of requests for new music.\nSo Now We're Gonna Do It!\nWe're going to make a brand-new, full-length studio album, and expand on our vision of increasing \u201cworld awesome\u201d. \n...And then go on TOUR! \nWe already have a bunch of songs written (over 40!), and have performed a few of them locally. A few tentative song titles include, \"Arising,\" \"Stand With Me,\" and \"Permanently Temporary.\" \nWe have also written a rehearsed a full-band version of \"The Fault In Our Stars\" - and it's pretty freaking epic!\nHowever, for the new album, we want to narrow it down to a strong dozen or so, probably a little less. So we'll hand-select just a few of the best songs we've written over the years, and write the rest from scratch. It just feels best that way.\nIf you'd like a small taste of the new Bloom sound...\nA few weeks ago, we released a pre-production version of one of our songs on YouTube, and Bloomers across the planet loved it! \nNow we're going to lock ourselves in the Bloom Room and write, and start blasting our new music out to the world as soon we possibly can. \nAnd that's where you come in :) \nWe need YOUR help to get this new album professionally produced and distributed! \nYour money will help us pay for:1.

Getting our new album professionally mixed and mastered so that it sounds like a rainbow flowing through you ears :)3. Getting our album distributed in a physical format (CDs!) so that you can actually hold it in your hand!\nWe created Photosynthesis without anyone but ourselves interested in the outcome, so now we are over-the-top excited to involve you in a BIG way. \nOn top of giving you a copy of the new album at least two weeks early and for a fraction of what it'll cost the general public - we're giving away a ton of other awesome, fun, and exclusive Kickstarter gifts to our backers. \nCheck out all of the rewards below! \nAnd get this: if you don't feel like pledging any dollar amount but would still like to support our project, just do us the favor of sharing this video and KickStarter project on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or wherever it is you hang out.

These amazing artists coming together across disciplines to make something special was really worth documenting. And well... we didn't do it.\nSo we want to fix that. What we\u2019re seeking to do, with your help, is return to New Orleans and uncover all of the bones and the steps that it took to bring this collaboration to the stage. The resulting feature-length documentary is titled Ma Maison, which is French for \u201cMy Home\u201d.\nWe're not aiming to go back and merely report what happened, but rather examine the nature of memory itself, and turn that inside out. We want to see how our memories change, over time, as we revisit the past. We'll conduct interviews with the key and peripheral players of this collaboration and follow the trails of their memories, embracing the conflicts and embellishments of what took place. We will then bring these misplaced and changed recollections to life through a series of recreations. The forms could vary wildly: anything from animation and puppetry, to cooking shows or a musical segment.\nThrough this, the memories that people hold onto will become history. In the end, the hope is to loosen the grip on the idea we have that there is some factual representation of the past. And actually the more beautiful, poetic, and important part of this is: things that emotionally resonate with us are the ones that have meaning.\nKickstarter video animation by Jason Sievers\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWith this film, we want to really give you insight into the creative process. What it truly takes to get a work of art on the stage: both the creative journey and the clunky human one. And now we have the chance to highlight the creative process in the making of this film itself. One of the reasons we're bringing this project onto Kickstarter is the opportunity to include you from the start, before the first frame has been shot, and bring you along every step of the way.\nWhere will the money go?\nEvery dollar you pledge will have a direct impact on what makes it to the screen. Your contribution allows us to get our hands on cameras, lenses, hard drives, plane tickets, microphones, costumes, lights, puppets, and all of the little details it takes to get a film made. \nHow about the rewards?\nAs a backer, you'll get access to exclusive blog posts, images, and videos that will bring you along with us for every step of the filmmaking process.\nOur rewards include DVD's, test screenings, dinner with the filmmakers, and more\nWho's involved?\nTrey McIntyre\nOne of the most sought-after choreographers and artists working today. Using dance and a variety of mediums to explore what it means to be human, McIntyre believes that the process of creating art\u2014from the studio to the stage\u2014is a metaphor for the journey of self-discovery. That exploration and discovery has inspired more than 90 works and high praise for its \u201csingular connection between movement and spirit.\u201d (Los Angeles Times)\nMcIntyre\u2019s inventive combination of the ballet lexicon, his connection to music, and an unflinching examination of the human condition has resulted in exceptional artistry that has garnered him a number of awards and much acclaim. McIntyre was named a United States Artists Wynn Fellow, he received the Gold Medal of Lifetime Achievement from the National Society of Arts and Letters, he received two choreographic fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, and he was the recipient of a Choo-San Goh Award for Choreography. The Los Angeles Times called McIntyre a \u201cbright light, a brainy ballet choreographer whose best works fuse visceral physicality with a deep and true humanism...\u201d The Boston Globe wrote \u201cIn a field overflowing with aspiring dance makers, Trey McIntyre continues to stand apart from\u2014and at times far above\u2014the crowd.\u201d The New York Times noted McIntyre as \u201cone of the most singular choreographic minds working in ballet today.\"\nTrey McIntyre Project\nTrey McIntyre Project is a contemporary ballet company led by the artistic vision of renowned choreographer Trey McIntyre.  Since its founding in 2008, TMP has fast become one of the most celebrated dance companies throughout the country and abroad. Trey McIntyre creates highly athletic, innovative works rooted in exploration and discovery, resulting in dance that\u2019s at once massively appealing, refreshingly relevant, and emotionally evocative. Known for its hallmark musicality and a distinct American voice, TMP uses the art of dance to break cultural boundaries and connect audiences on a basic, yet decidedly profound, human level. TMP\u2019s unique approach expands art beyond the stage and into communities, where it has the power to reach people and touch lives.\nTMP has been featured in The New York Times, Dance Magazine, and on PBS NewsHour, and has earned coast-to-coast acclaim from the likes of The Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Boston Globe and more. Based in Boise, Idaho, TMP has graced the stages of prestigious venues such as Jacob\u2019s Pillow, Vail International Dance Festival, Brooklyn Academy of Music, Carnegie Hall, Zellerbach Hall, and Walt Disney Concert Hall; TMP\u2019s global tours have included China, Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic.\nPreservation Hall Jazz Band\nThe Preservation Hall Jazz Band derives its name from Preservation Hall, the venerable music venue located in the heart of New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, founded in 1961 by Allan and Sandra Jaffe. The band has traveled worldwide spreading their mission to nurture and perpetuate the art form of New Orleans Jazz. Whether performing at Carnegie Hall or Lincoln Center, for British Royalty or the King of Thailand, this music embodies a joyful, timeless spirit. Under the auspices of current director, Ben Jaffe, the son of founders Allan and Sandra, Preservation Hall continues with a deep reverence and consciousness of its greatest attributes in the modern day as a venue, band, and record label.\nThe building that houses Preservation Hall has housed many businesses over the years including a tavern during the war of 1812, a photo studio and an art gallery. It was during the years of the art gallery that then owner, Larry Borenstein, began holding informal jam sessions for his close friends. Out of these sessions grew the concept of Preservation Hall. The intimate venue, whose weathered exterior has been untouched over its history, is a living embodiment of its original vision. To this day, Preservation Hall has no drinks, air conditioning, or other typical accoutrements strictly welcoming people of all ages interested in having one of the last pure music experiences left on the earth.\nOne last thing\nIf we don't reach our goal of $18,000 by September 6th, we will not get any of the money our backers have contributed.

See right for details.\nFinders Keepers is an oftentimes hilarious, at turns tragic narrative that delves into the very real lives that created - and were forever changed by - the fantastical headlines.\n                                 Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for\n                                           exclusive content and giveaways!\nA few years back I agreed to help my former boss Ed Cunningham organize some documentary footage he'd shot - from a passion project he'd poured years of his life into - so that he could bury it into storage.\nWhile archiving his footage, first of some local North Carolina news reports, I learned about this guy, Shannon, who found a mummified human leg in a barbecue grill that he bought at an auction.\nThen there was the national news footage of how Shannon wanted to turn the leg into a tourist attraction ($3 a peek, $1 for kids).  And then the international news of how Shannon subsequently sued the leg's amputee owner, a guy named John, for possession of it.  Crazy, right?\nBut then I got to the footage that Ed had filmed with real-life John and Shannon and their families, and saw what didn't make the news.  Like how John had lost his leg in a tragic plane crash.  That killed his father.  On the day they had finally made amends.  My interest was piqued.\nThen I saw how Shannon had really just seen the leg as his ticket out of a life of hardship.  And how the insane media frenzy covering the leg custody battle had sent John into a spiral of addiction and very nearly killed him, until a whole mess of strangely improbable things happened that I don't have room to explain but are ridiculous and oddly spiritual and philosophical and inspiring...\nIt soon became obvious that this film that Ed had spent years and a small fortune pursuing was unlike anything I'd seen before.  And so it would be a long time before I would understand firsthand why he would ever desert it.\nHe paid me for the work and we parted ways, but for the next few years the story gnawed away at me.  I would laugh about it to myself in the car.  I would tell people about it at parties.  Finally, I ended up talking Ed into letting me take a crack at directing the project.\nIt was about that time I discovered why he'd set it aside in the first place: people don't like investing in documentaries - even those produced by Oscar-winning producers, he explained.  And not in a mean, philistine-y way, but it's just that statistically, most docs don't make money.  I smiled and nodded as I pried the footage from his hands.\nI've taken meetings with production companies.  I've sat down with potential investors.  They all loved the story and told me they'd get back to me.  In the meantime I got a great producer (Adam Gibbs), went to North Carolina, found an awesome crew (Adam Hobbs, Tim Grant and Jeremy Ball), and we shot some amazing interviews and beautiful visuals! \n...but we've yet to hear back from any investors.  And now all our money has been spent on equipment, motels and Red Bull.  A few years ago, our story would have ended here.\nEd tried his best and came up short, then I tried my best and it still wasn't enough, and now we're humbly asking you to carry the torch and produce a film that would otherwise never exist.\nIf you laughed during The King of Kong, or cried during Undefeated (just be honest - I sure did), now you can help keep alive a rare tradition of documentaries that are as much fun as they are inspiring.\nBe a part of our production, get play-by-play updates, give us tips, ask our subjects questions.

THANK YOU to every one of Mutator's passionate backers!!!  \nPlease visit Mutator.co for updates, to sign up for the mailing list, or to contact us!\nHi, I'm Ron. \nIt's Murphy's law: if I'm at an important meeting, or some other place where my iPhone absolutely should not make noise, it invariably will find a way to be disruptive. We've all been there when it happens to us (or if we're lucky, to someone else) and it can be quite embarrassing. \nAlthough there is a \"Ring/Silent\" switch on most iOS devices, I have repeatedly found that videos, music, apps and even Siri can make noise when the switch is set to silent.\nIt's 2013, and this isn't really news anymore. It's been going on since the dawn of the digital device, and in this case the iPhone. (A great summation on the iPhone mute debate \u2014 and one of the inspirations behind creating Mutator \u2014 can be found on Dan Benjamin's last official blogpost to the world: http://hivelogic.com/articles/mute )\nApple says this isn't a global \"mute\" switch, but rather a switch to silence the phone's ringer\nFrom Apple's iPhone User Guide (pg. 10):\nThere you have it.  In Apple's own words, the \"mute\" switch doesn't actually mute all sounds.  \nSo what is an iPhone-loving, techno-crazed Apple junkie to do? For years I lived with the apocalyptic fear that at any moment my phone would erupt into an onslaught of sonic desagilation. After searching for a fix that would ease my mind \u2014 with no luck \u2014 I finally decided to develop my own solution.\nSometimes noisy phones are no bueno\nThat's when Mutator was born.  Mutator is a simple, sleek device that keeps your phone quiet.  Mutator mutes all sounds generated by videos, songs, games, apps, Siri and more. Kills 'em dead. Gonzo. Adios. Sayonara.\nThe first thing you should know about Mutator is that it is designed with you in mind. Keep your iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch in the silent zone with the only low-profile, minimal, beautiful device that can hush your phone on command. \nMutator's sleek, low-profile design keeps your iPhone silent while staying out of the way\nNeed your phone to make some noise? No sweat. Simply twist Mutator 90\u00b0 \u2014 no need to remove Mutator in order to disengage silent mode.\nSimply twist Mutator to engage or disengage silent mode\nWhere is Mutator useful?\nBusiness Meetings\nClasses\nFor kids\nChurch \nFunerals (don't be that guy)\nConcerts\nMovies\nJury duty \nHiding in the root cellar during the next zombie apocalypse\nMutator makes everything muy bueno\nMutator lets you know when you're in silent mode through a tactile \"click\" that is felt when it twists into place. You can even check whether Mutator is in mute-mode while your phone is in your pocket, purse, or on the bedside table at night when it's dark.\nMutator is a deceptively simple-looking (and small) product. As I was working through the early development process, it became clear that Mutator will require a few moderately complex steps for production. In order to produce a high-quality custom headphone tip, I have selected a top-level engineering firm in Salt Lake City, UT. I have also lined up a secondary manufacturer in the event that our original manufacturer falls through.\nThere's a certain enjoyment that comes from designing and prototyping a new product. But nothing matches what I expect will be the joy of getting the final, polished version of Mutator in my (and your) hands. That's where you come in: your generous pledge will allow me to get Mutator mass-produced and available for seekers of silence everywhere.\nHere's where the Mutator project funds will be utilized:\nProduction-level prototypes \nTooling, Fabrication, and Assembly\nInjection Molding \nMachining / Anodization\nPackage design and creation \nGlobal Mutator Delivery", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am committed to creating a great product that lives up to the scrutiny of iPhone, iPad, and iPod lovers everywhere.

Even if a project fails I understand my role & the creators and could move on knowing I tried to help someone create an interesting project but it just didn't pan out. Reading through all the comments below it's hard to believe this is a simple case of a failed project.

While it's true that Kickstarter can not force a creator to refund money it is also true that numerous people have already been sued because of these \"scam\" projects when it becomes evident that very little truth can be found behind their entire process. If we could be given the respect we deserve, as people who blindly backed this project because we believed in it, then it would be an easier pill to swallow. I don't like being disrespected and I don't like being lied to.

As with all previous updates this update will go out to all backers, so you will be notified once it is posted.\" but it's been 9 months and this secondary update has not come.

It seemed like a death sentence but through Kickstarter God have turned it into a life sentence.\nNow those of you who have been saved under this ministry, inspired to serve the Lord through the songs and grew up on Satan Bite The Dust, No Monsters and the Champion can actually participate in the process on over a dozen levels of making a record. There's a level of giving for everyone. Starting at $1. You might have someone you love, a Mom or Dad, Pastor, Musician, youth Leader or a die Hard fan who always wanted to get in on the making of a Carman CD. Well this is their once in a lifetime opportunity. As one fan said on Facebook \"Look at what Jesus did in 3 years\". So as for you and me, with this new project and us working together, the next 3 years are going to be a blast.\nGod Bless,\nCarman\nP.S.\nYou become part of the team by joining me, in any one of 14 different levels of giving. For each level you will receive a special gift of appreciation from me. No matter where your at in your faith your finances or both, there's a level for you to participate.

I can't imagine someone lying about having cancer and a don't believe he would. I believe he is now on tour and for someone who has gone through a year of what's he's gone through, I think he is doing what he can as far as the concerts. If I get something..that's fine, if I don't that's fine too.

We didn't have that witchcraft back then, and I'm not about to start using it now.\n\nInstead, if you wanted to get that hip robotty sound, you used a talkbox. \nWhat's a talkbox?\nGood question. It\u2019s basically a device that routes a speaker\u2019s sound through a tube, which you put into your mouth. Then you use your lips and teeth to shape the sound.\nIt\u2019s a unique effect that has been used by Peter Frampton, Stevie Wonder, Sly & the family Stone, Steppenwolf, Steely Dan, Joe Walsh, Bon Jovi, the Foo Fighters\u2026 I could go on.\nBut traditional talkboxes are expensive, and on top of that you\u2019ve got to own a guitar or a keyboard or a synthesizer, and you\u2019ve got to buy cables to connect them, and by that point you\u2019re poor.\nTraditional talkboxes are expensive. Ours is not.\nBut we thought, what if you could make a smaller, portable, affordable talkbox that could take advantage of the sound-making capabilities of the iPhone? So that\u2019s what we did.\nIt\u2019s called the Wee-Wow.  \nIt\u2019s a tiny little adapter that clips onto your phone, capturing the sound from the phone\u2019s speaker and routing it through a piece of tubing. What you do from there is up to you. \nThe easiest thing is to make the signature \u201cwee-wow\u201d sound.\nBut with a little practice, you can start forming words and phrases, singing the ABC\u2019s, or whatever you can think up.\nThe best part is, you can take advantage of the thousands of sound-making apps available on the iPhone, from synthesizers to guitars and pianos and ukuleles and just about anything else you can think of. With the right cable, you can even plug in a real guitar and jam out.\nWe\u2019ve made prototypes for both the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 5, but now we need your help to put together our first production run. With the money we raise, we'll be able to get injection molds made and to manufacture the first batch of production quality WeeWows.\nGet a Wee-Wow. Make some cool sounds.

The book will also include a collection of foreword by Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull fame.\nThis Kickstarter campaign runs through March 27, which is my father's birthday.  I'm doing the Kickstarter campaign to publish THE LEIGHTON EXPLOSION with a Canadian company who promises to get it into the schools.  I'll be performing my poems in five markets in addition to the Bronx and Manhattan:  Buffalo, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and possibly Canada, so I'll be hooking up with a Bronx area musician.\nI'm updating my blog at http://workinggalrockandroll.blogspot.com/ with poetry, and writing up real simple videos where you get to see the glam and glitter of my home-- where I write most of my poems, and you'll also get to meet my cats. \nThis campaign is a lot of fun for me.  One of the cool rewards is we get to talk on the phone or on SKYPE and then I'll write a poem for you, and perform it on an MP3 and CD, and mail it to you.  Another reward is where you would get a new copy of my upcoming indie book release: GET THE GIGS (COMMON SENSE CAREER CREATING).  It shows how you can create opportunities for yourself, and will be available as a PDF file or in a looseleaf binder.  And I can do a consultancy with you on something in your career that's related to your goals as an independent artist, musician, business person!\nI also have a reward to give you PDF files of my favorite plays and screenplays that I wrote for $10.  \nI got my artists involved with this, and have autographed CDs or DVDs and photos from Jethro Tull, Grand Funk Railroad, the Strawbs, Joe Deninzon & Stratospheerius, Jann Klose, and former clients, as well!  That package also includes a chat and a personalized poem, and other goodies for $750. now, because that's about all the campaign needs to make it now.\nMy favorite reward is a poetry workshop and reading with you and your students for the full goal of the campaign-- $1000., plus transportation and lodging. \nGo through the different rewards, pick whatever you'd like.  Also if you see something that a friend would like, such as me writing a poem for them, please encourage them to join my campaign.\nHopefully we'll all give each other some inspiration with this project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I think about my challenges in completing this project, I know I can't predict what the future will bring.\n\nIt's possible I won't go with my Canadian publisher and could publish THE LEIGHTON EXPLOSION on my own.

He's a small town attorney who helps folks set up their businesses. http://www.lawbloomington.com/ Or hopefully my friends will put out the book, and help finish the prize rewards 'cause they understand I'm dedicated to my legacy!

Now--early 2013, I am at a very simple stage where I've been sometimes only moderately confused (and nothing more) on train platforms and in crossing streets (especially around two-way, three-way, and four-or-more-way) by myself. So I just breathe and think, and take my time crossing or wait till someone walks by, and I ask them for help. And then they tell me about someone they know who has anxiety, and I thank them.\n\nLast year I was sobbing and having panic attacks on the streets AND in wide open spaces including sidewalks, even when other people were helping me--I've come a long way. I'm touring in this project, and I'll do it as I will have a fellow performer (a musician) with me. We'll watch each other's back.\n\nYou ask, \"What if I don't find the musician right for my poetry?\" \n\nWell... read my poetry, watch my video, check out this site, and you'll understand my optimism, ambition, and the rest of me! \n\nI'll find the musician, I know I can. :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Halloween updates", "update_content": "It's a joy to reconnect with folks who supported my crowdfunding campaign.

My social enterprise, breadpig, is working with Lester and his son Dylan to organize this Kickstarter to back a new album by (and entirely owned by) Lester Chambers himself so the man can finally get his due. The open internet can make right what the music industry has done so wrong.\n---\nAs seen on r/videos and the frontpage of YouTube, this trailer of Lester's story has now had over 500,000 views!\nRead Lester's reddit Ask Me Anything interview from Dec 13th.\nLast spring, we saw the story of Lester Chambers bubble up on the internet. The lead singer of 1960s soul music group The Chambers Brothers posted this photo:\nLester Chambers' Viral Photo\n\u201cI am the former lead singer of a 60\u2032s band. I did not squander my money on drugs or a fancy home. I went from 1967-1994 before I saw my first royalty check. The music giants I recorded with only paid me for 7 of my albums. I have never seen a penny in royalties from my other 10 albums I recorded. Our hit song was licensed to over 100 films, TV & commercials without our permission. One major TV network used our song for a national commercial and my payment was $625 dollars. I am now 72, trying to live on $1200 a month. Sweet Relief, a music charity, is taking donations for me. Only the 1% of artists can afford to sue. I am the 99%.\u201d\nThe music industry may have screwed Lester Chambers for decades, but we the internet public can right their wrong.\nThanks to the open internet (things we fought for against SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, etc.), sites like Kickstarter and other innovations that are being worked on by entrepreneurs right now, we have the opportunity to do right by artists and cut out those who'd mistreat them. We have the opportunity to create solutions that will support artists in the digital world.\nThe Chambers Brothers\nLester Chambers is putting together a new album titled \"Lester's Time Has Come.\" With this project, we have the opportunity to support not only the awesome work of a storied and talented musician, but we have the chance to stand up against the tyranny of the record industry. Stand with Lester, and stand for innovation that supports artists' rights.\nA note from Lester: \"I thank God for the opportunities I have been blessed with and when Alexis Ohanian called all I could say was WOW. All the times I sat hoping and wishing I could make another record had finally come true. In this record I promise to have some of the worlds GREATEST songs from your past and some Great New songs for your new year to come!\"\nRead more about Lester in his interview with Vice.\nFather & Son\nEven with a daunting list of illnesses and a life of hardship at the hands of the music industry, Lester is not a beaten man, far from it, and it's clear that his son is a big part of that.\n\"My son, Michael Dylan, said 'Dad don't worry. I'm never gonna leave you. Always stay by your side.' He slept on the floor with me.... Every father in the world should have a son like I have.\"\n\"Fathers be aware, if your son is not what Michael Dylan is to me, to you -- straighten him out.\"\nLester & Dylan Chambers, a few years later.\nFunds from this project will go to Lester via the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund, which provides financial assistance to career musicians who are struggling to make ends meet while facing illness, disability, or age-related problems.

Most importantly, it teaches self-respect and respect for your partner. When Pierre started the program, the children were spitting on each other. At the end of 10 weeks, they were holding each other and respecting each other.\nPierre believes if we can change the children, we can change the future.\nWe have the ability to touch thousands of lives with this film and convert old conversations into new partnerships and community.

This is a film about the power of art in a community with deep-seated resentment and prejudice.\nIt is a story of defying expectations and believing that we are all capable of change.\nWHAT WE NEED & WHERE WE ARE\nWe are so pleased to have received support from the Israeli Broadcaster, Keshet, Righteous Persons Foundation, Shine Global, Fohs Foundation, and the Gesher Fund.

For too long, we've been seduced into believing we should do less. It's time to redefine what we're capable of.\nWe are all artists now, and the connection economy we're living in relentlessly rewards those who do work that matters. Okay, you knew that. So why aren't you?\nMy first new printed book in over a year is combined with two extraordinary bonuses\u2014and the chance to send a message about how books and bookstores can still be part of the conversation. (Be sure to check out the no-brainer option).\nCan you produce what you're capable of?\nThe Icarus Deception is my most personal book, a direct statement about the fundamental changes in the connection economy and the opportunity for individuals to face their fear and make art, to make a difference and to do work that matters.\nIt's the capstone to Linchpin, Tribes and Poke the Box, but works great for someone who hasn't read any of my books.\nSink or swim--I'll need your help\nIf this Kickstarter campaign reaches the minimum, then the publisher has agreed to launch a major retail campaign to introduce the book to readers in bookstores. They'll also publish V is for Vulnerable (an illustrated ABC book) as well as a smaller, significantly-abridged version of the bonus 'big' book. The Kickstarter will be officially on, and if you're a backer, you will get the rewards you chose. First and cheaper.\nIf it doesn't reach the minimum, none of the backers will be charged and the book doesn't get published.\nBonuses\nBeyond The Icarus Deception, there are many bonuses, some unique to this Kickstarter and never to be offered again. Mostly because you guys like bonuses and I like making them. In this case, the two big bonuses worth seeking out are V is for Vulnerable, the ABC book based on Icarus and illustrated by Hugh MacLeod, as well as the heavy, huge, long and delightful best-of collection of the last six years of my online writing, now in print for the first time ever, and never to be sold in a bookstore. There will only be 5,000 copies of this huge collection in print. I'm pretty sure you're going to love it. Only my loyal, intelligent and good-looking Kickstarter backers can get the limited edition book.\nV is for Vulnerable combines the insights of the last section of Icarus with inspired color illustrations from the brilliant Hugh MacLeod. It's an ABC kid's book for adults.\nTHE BIG LIMITED EDITION DIGITAL BOOK ON PAPER (real title to come) is more than a quarter of a million words of my best online writing from the last six years, collected in an old-school, easy-to-use hardcover format. This edition will never be sold in stores, so this is your one and only chance to stock up. Expect an abridged, smaller edition to appear in stores one day.\nFaster and cheaper\nSometime after your copy is delivered in January, the Icarus book will show up (at a higher price) in bookstores and online. You can help me make the minimum by buying copies now, at a discount, to distribute to friends. \nI love making and sharing books because of the power they give us to spread ideas and change minds. Maybe this will help authors like me continue to make books by hand, and maybe this Kickstarter will outline a way other authors can rally a tribe, connect them, engage the early adopters and then reward them with an artifact they helped bring to life.\nDid I mention the No-Brainer option is your best bet?\nBut what is the book about?\nIt's about the connection economy and the value created when we give up doing what we're told (and avoiding what we fear) and start making art instead. The art of important work, of making a ruckus and of inventing the future.\nThis isn't a book about craft or paint or decoration. It's for anyone who cares a lot about why they went to work today and how they could do it better. I think we can learn a lot from the people who have changed their outlook and changed their lives in their quest to make art.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nIt's easier than ever to spread a book, especially one that's just digital. You can give it away for free and reach millions. The challenge is that it's not on paper, it's not easy to hand to someone else, and most of all, you lose the bookstore.\nThis project on Kickstarter is my way to organize the tribe, to send a signal to risk-averse publishers and booksellers (who have limited shelf space and limited paper). We can let them know loud and clear that this is a book that's going to get talked about. Kickstarter coordinates and it amplifies.\nWhy limited?\nYou'll notice that unlike most Kickstarters, there isn't unlimited upside here, as all the rewards listed so far have a limited quantity. I know that this may disappoint people if we run out, but the point of this project isn't to maximize the income from the tribe, it's to sell things at a fair price while organizing the tribe and persuading the book publishing world to step up and do a serious job of retail work in January.\nThat probably leaves money on the table, but attention and connection are the goal, not maximizing profit.\nWho is the artist?\nThe painter in front of a blank canvas. The architect changing the rules of construction. The playwright who makes us cry. The doctor who cares enough to call. The detective who cracks a cold case. The diva with a new interpretation of a classic. The customer service rep who, despite the distance and the rush, makes an honest connection. The entrepreneur who dares to start without permission or authority. The middle manager who transforms the key meeting with a single comment. \nYou?\nThe future of books belongs to readers who care.\nThank you for making it happen, and for spreading the word.\nCredits: Cover photo by Sue Demetriou.

If you're interested in getting news about the project and finding out how to get a copy of the book, please visit the project website, http://www.olympiccityproject.com. Thanks!\nThe Olympic City is a photography project by Jon Pack and Gary Hustwit that looks at the legacy of the Olympic Games in former host cities around the world. Hosting the Olympics has become a way for a city to show itself off on an international stage and generate toursim dollars, and cities spend millions or billions for the privilege. But after the events are over, the medals have been handed out, and the torch is extinguished, what's next? What happens to a city after the Olympics are gone?\nIn The Olympic City, we're documenting the successes and failures, the forgotten remnants and ghosts of the Olympic spectacle. Some former Olympic sites are retrofitted and used in ways that belie their grand beginnings; turned into prisons, housing, malls, gyms, churches. Others sit unused for decades and become tragic time capsules, examples of misguided planning and broken promises of the benefits that the Games would bring. We're interested in these disparate ideas \u2014 decay and rebirth \u2014 and how each site seems to have gone one way or the other, either by choice or circumstance. We're equally interested in the lives of the people whose neighborhoods have been transformed by Olympic development.\nA large-format hardcover art book (approximately 200 pages) will be published in March, 2013, in a limited edition of 1,000 copies. In addition to the photos, the book will feature text contributions from several writers we admire. Publication will coincide with an exhibition of the photographs in New York City and other cities, details TBA. We're also producing a digital version of the book, and 100 signed copies of a deluxe edition that will include two original photo prints from the project. \nWe're excited that acclaimed graphic designer Paul Sahre is designing the book:\nThe money raised in this Kickstarter campaign will cover travel, production, and design expenses, and the printing costs for the books (we're aiming for quality along the lines of publishers like Steidl) and the prints. \nWe've already photographed in Los Angeles, Montreal, Lake Placid, Athens, and Rome. We've just finished documenting Mexico City (see our updates) and we'll be shooting more cities this summer and fall. Which other Olympic cities will be included? We're keeping that under wraps for now, but if you back the project, you'll have a say. We'll be putting one of our city choices to a vote and letting our backers decide where we should go. Our backers will also get exclusive email dispatches and photos from the road this summer and fall, as we document the remaining cities. \nThanks!\nJon and Gary\n------------------\nP.S. - We'll be selling a limited number of copies of the book to art book stores and specialist shops. If you're with a shop and would like to sell the book once it's published, please contact us.\nP.P.S. - The word \"Olympic\" and the Olympic rings symbol are trademarks of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and are used in connection with this project under the Fair Use Doctrine covering commentary and criticism.

It's a collection of stories about life, the choices we all make, and the paths we ultimately decide to follow. \nWe examine the factors that motivate and drive our major life choices. And, most importantly, whether or not the path we follow through life - and the habits we form based on that path - are truly connected with who we really are as individuals.\nThis is a movie about the moment people realize the life they're living is not the life that's true to their heart... and, as a result, what they decide to do about it!\nFor more insight, don't miss the trailer featured in the video above!\nWe (a film crew of 5) spent two months traveling the U.S. interviewing dozens and dozens of every day people from different backgrounds about their lives and past choices (over 60+ interviews total).\nTo sum it up simply: the journey of making this film changed our lives forever.\nWe knew we had something special when we started. Yet, we had no idea how powerful the stories of the people we met would be until we completed the filming.\nAnd now it's our responsibility to share these stories and the inspiring message with the world in the most engaging way possible.\nAnd that's where we need you. \n*****\nWE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE -- WE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWe've given our blood, sweat, and tears (not to mention tens of thousands of our own dollars) to organize the whirlwind road trip and capture the first initial chunk of the film.\nHere's the problem: as much time, energy, and money it took to FILM the movie - it costs even more to edit, produce, release, and distribute it!\nYikes!\nFor example, here's just a small slice of where our Kickstarter funds will go:\nEditing and organizing the raw footage.\nShooting additional footage (we need to \"pick up\" some shots).\nStoryboarding and planning.\nColor correction.\nSound mixing.\nLicensing the soundtrack.\nResearching archived footage and commercials.\nLegal fees and release licensing.\nDistribution rights for the film (online and offline).\nOur 3-city premiere screening schedule (before it's public).\nMarketing and promotion (online and offline).\nFilm festival and registration fees and filing.\nBottom line: there are too many moving parts for us to do this all ourselves!\nOur world premiere of the documentary will be in July - at the World Domination Summit (a creative conference) in Portland, Oregon. We're scheduled to release the film online a few weeks later (late July)!\nSeveral of the crew members and our families have moved out to the San Francisco Bay area to push towards finishing production. With the help of this campaign we can team up with Stillmotion, an Emmy-award winning production studio, to help build the story, edit the film, and consult on the post-production schedule.\nIt's an ambitious schedule, but we're an ambitious crew! :) \nWith your help we can make it happen - and get this message out to the world in July!\nOUR GOAL WITH THIS DOCUMENTARY\nWe believe that the stories we captured deserve to be told - and that by sharing them we can inspire thousands and thousands of people to take action and change their lives for the better.\nOur goal is to ignite a movement of people who are tired of settling for mediocrity. We want to eliminate \"getting by,\" \"doing fine,\" \"could be worse,\" and \"can't complain\" from the vocabulary of our modern culture.\nWe want to rally together a like-minded group of people who are fed up with living life through someone else's script - and ready to live life on their OWN terms.\nTogether, with your help, we believe we can challenge people to dig back up their childhood dreams... to tap back into their deepest passions... and to take action to make those values more of a priority in their life moving forward.\nHelp us do it!\nHERE'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS!\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars in money to creative projects in dozens of categories.\nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to the documentary is called a \"pledge.\"\nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge.\nFor example, if you pledge $5 to help back the project - we'll offer you a full-length, HD download of the documentary. You'll get access days before it's made public! :)\nPledge levels vary from just $5 to several hundreds of dollars. And each different level opens up a new, creative reward. (For a full list, check out the right side of the page - or scroll down the page a bit more).\nHOW TO PLEDGE AND BECOME A BACKER!\nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps:\nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page.\nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount - and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds!\nThat's it! \nYou've played an important role in sharing this message with the world (and get some pretty sweet rewards too!). \nWe owe you big time!\nSpecial note: Your pledges aren't actually processed by Kickstarter unless the campaign is 100% successful. We meet our goal or we get nothing! Don't worry, with your help we know we can knock this out of the park!\nAMAZING REWARDS (WHAT YOU GET AS A BACKER)\nNote: All levels have FREE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING. Yes, really. Anywhere in the world - we'll ship it out to you. Super simple. :)\n$5 pledge -- You'll get a full-length, HD download of the movie. It's DRM-free, which simply means you'll be able to transfer and play it from all your devices! (A couple people have called us \"crazy\" for giving away the complete documentary for just $5 - but we're really dedicated to making this story accessible to as many people as possible!)\n$25 pledge -- You'll get the physical DVD of the documentary, along with the digital download. Again, this is the most affordable price point we could offer for creating the full DVD (it includes free shipping anywhere in the world!).\n$50 pledge -- You'll get what we're calling a \"swag pack\" along with the DVD and the download. At the minimum your pack will contain a special kickstarter-only, signed movie poster and unique DVD cover. But we reserve the right to add in  extra miscellaneous goodies! ;)\n$100 pledge -- Starting at this level, we'll put your name in the actual credits of the movie (only if you want us to, of course)! Whoo-hoo! Obviously, you'll still get the swag pack, the DVD (except yours will now be signed!), and the download.\n$250 pledge -- This level gets you two (2) VIP tickets to one of our three scheduled premieres. There are three different options for you - one for the world premiere in Portland, one for the east coast premiere in NYC, and one for the Hollywood premiere in Los Angeles. Each ticket gets you special seating, free food and drink, and time hanging out with the crew before and after the showing. And of course, you'll still get your name in the credits, the swag pack, the DVD, and the downloadable version.\nSpecial note: The world premiere in Portland won't be open to the public. It's only available to people attending the World Domination Summit (a sold out conference) and VIP Kickstarter ticket holders through this campaign. However, the NYC and L.A. premieres will have general admission tickets available at a later date (you just won't get the royal treatment of the VIPs). ;)\n$500 pledge -- You'll receive a special \"home screening\" kit to premiere the movie at you home (or wherever you want actually!). Your kit includes 15 signed DVDs, 15 signed, limited-edition movie posters, and 15 individual download codes for your guests (yep, international shipping included for free!). In addition, Adam (producer) and Grant (director) will do everything possible to call or Skype live into your home premiere to personally thank you and your guests! In the unlikely event we can't call in live - we'll record a custom video for you to play before the movie. :)\n$1000 pledge -- Starting at this level, you'll receive official \"Associate Producer\" credit (yes, even in IMDB) for the film and in the credits. We (Grant and Adam) would also love to share a private meal with you, your family, or your friends. We'll make every attempt to be able to schedule this at a time that's convenient to all parties (travel for you and your guest is not included). You'll also receive four (4) VIP tickets (optional, if you can make it) for one of the three premieres listed above (Portland, NYC, L.A. - travel not included). And, as is typical, we'll still send you the full \"home screening\" kit listed above with multiple DVDs, swag, and downloads for your friends and guests.\n$5000 pledge -- We'll bring the party to you! We'll come to your city or hometown, anywhere in the United States or Canada, to premiere the movie in a local theater (or a creative location). We'll work closely with you to coordinate the best premiere we possibly can (we'll help get the word out - and make it a memorable screening!). You'll also be entitled to everything in the \"Associate Producer\" level above (including the official movie credit). Essentially, you get it ALL, baby!\nTHE BRILLIANT PEOPLE WE MET ALONG THE WAY!\nIn addition to the remarkable individual stories from across the country, we were fortunate to also be able to grab the insight of dozens of experts, academics, bloggers, and authors - including:\nJonathan Fields\nJosh Kaufman\nSam Stratman\nDerek Halpern\nPace Smith\nNick Reese\nJohnny B. Truant\nPam Slim\nMJ DeMarco\nJoshua Becker\nPat Flynn\nMax Spiker\nErica Douglass\nEric Handler\nLewis Howes\nNeal Frankle\nScott Dinsmore\nChris Guillebeau\nJonathan Mead\nMark Silver\nCharlie Gilkey\nJD Roth\nDanielle LaPorte\nKim and Jason Kotecki\nThe perspectives of these experts - on various related topics - was a fantastic compliment to the passionate stories we collected along the way.\nNote: These are just a portion of the people we met along the way. We won't list out all the individual stories we captured - you'll get to see those in the movie itself! ;)\nHOW TO SHARE THIS WITH THE WORLD!\nAs we mentioned in the video message before the trailer, we don't have the help of a hollywood studio or television network with deep pockets. But we have something better -- your word-of-mouth!\nThe best way to help is to share this very page with your family, friends, and coworkers!\nBest ways to share this campaign and our exciting trailer:\nOn Facebook. By far, our best tool for sharing this message is through Facebook. You can simply click the \"Like\" button directly below the video at the top of the screen. Or paste the URL straight onto your page with a message!\nOn Twitter. You can also tweet out the video - once again by click the button under the video or simply sharing our the direct URL for this page.\nA short email. Think about the people in your life that may benefit from this message (or appreciate helping to spread the message). Write a short note to them in an email! We'll owe ya! :)\nOld fashioned word-of-mouth. Unplug the computer and your phone and just talk with people in your lives about it! Few things beat a genuine, face-to-face conversation. :)\nAgain, any way you can help - big or small - is deeply appreciated! The more conversations we can start around this issue... the better!\nGET A HOLD OF US - WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU!\nContact Adam Baker (producer):\nAdamCBaker@gmail.com (via email)\n@ManVsDebt (on twitter)\nContact Grant Peelle (director):\nGrant@CrankTank.com (via email)\n@grantpeelle (on twitter)\nMore about the project and team:\n\"I'm Fine, Thanks\" Facebook Page (new)\nThe Making of \"I'm Fine, Thanks\" (Part One) Blog Post\nThe Making of \"I'm Fine, Thanks\" (Part Two) Blog Post\nWhen in doubt, reach out to the team.

Orders are processed through Amazon, which operates in the far majority of countries. We also include international shipping for free!\nCan I change levels after I pledge?\nYes, you can. If you can't decide between two levels, pledge the smaller one - and up until the end of the campaign you can change it to the higher level (and still get all the rewards)!\nCan I give this as a gift?\nYes, again! Once the campaign is over, we will reach out to confirm shipping addresses, how your name should appear in credit (for $100+ pledges), and other details. You can provide us with the information for the lucky gift getter!\nCan I get more information about larger pledge levels?\nAbsolutely. Email AdamCBaker@gmail.com directly. Adam would love to talk with you and answer any questions you may have.\nWhat happens if we don't reach our goal?\nWe get nothing! You aren't charged and we don't receive any of the funding. Don't worry, this won't happen! It's going to be amazing! :)\nWhat happens if we go over the goal?\nWe make a larger impact on thousands of more people! We get to receive any funds that go over our goal - and will funnel those back into the film to have an even larger premiere schedule and release.\nHow is my pledge processed and charged?\nOnce the campaign is successful, your pledge will be processed by Amazon. It's safe and secure - Amazon is one of the premiere online retailers.\nIs shipping included for rewards?\nAbsolutely! We'll ship your rewards anywhere in the world - 100% free.\n*****\nThanks again for all your support!

AND (\"BUT\") I think two things. If you want to get higher dollar value pledges, you might really offer more opportunity to view some insight into your work, more footage, more about why people should invest in you. At *least* offer that possibility within the pledge description at the $1000 and $5000 level. Don't make people have to come to YOU to ask for it. Tell them \"please contact us if you are considering this pledge, and we would love to give you much more information about who we are\". Also, how about offering a small amount of return on investment if people pledge at the $1000 or $5000 level. Even 0.1% of the profits. Even if there are no profits, your can put that clause in up front---that we don't guarantee any profits. These are my ideas. You may very well have thought these through and come up with reasons for not doing that. I'm just saying what makes me and a lot of people \"tick\" when considering pledging on that level. And I'm writing this in the public comments, because I think maybe it might make other people chime in with their reactions to these ideas. (Yes, I'm fully ready for people to challenge me, and won't be offended if you do). Finally, to the producers, if it really bothers you in any way that I've put this comment here, and you feel it's affecting your approach, let me know, and I will remove it.
