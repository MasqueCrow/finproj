[{"backer": "Deniz Derin \u00d6zer", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Back in 2016, I started designing Aton Playing Cards as a private project to merge my two passions for Egyptian mythology and graphic design. I wanted to create a playful yet sophisticated design that balances the fine line between modern-minimal and classical Egyptian art style. After completing a first version of the then called Wadjet Playing Cards (unreleased), I closed the project with a few individual prototypes.\nAs I rediscovered the cards during lockdown 2020, I began to take on some minor changes and introduce a few new ideas to the design. No sooner had I returned to this project than I was filled with verve and eager to rework the whole design.  \n\nDELUXE tuck boxes feature matte colored paper stock with embossing and gold foil. Embossing on the tuck box alludes to relief sculpture, an art technique used by ancient Egyptian artists to emphasise the three-dimensional structure of the depicted gods and godesses. The gold foil accentuates the highly detailed design and refers to the gilded artworks of ancient Egypt. \nCLASSIC (printed) tuck boxes feature a sleek and modest design. Inspired by the frugal use of color in hieroglyphic wall inscriptions, they pull the attention towards the richly colored cards inside. \nCLASSIC Tuck Boxes\nThe tuck and back designs are inspired by the winged sun disk, the Egyptian symbol of divinity, royalty and power. The disk represents the sun god ATON himself. He is protected by the two goddesses Wadjet (serpent) and Nekhbet (vulture), the patron goddesses of upper and lower Egypt.  \nEbony DELUXE Edition (Gold Foil & Embossing on Tuck Box)\nEbony DELUXE Edition\nEbony CLASSIC Edition\nEach suit represents one of the four major aspects of life in ancient Egypt. They're embodied by the three deities on the corresponding court cards.\nThe red suits represent the two positively connoted aspects of life. Hearts refer to the origin and integrity of Life. Here we find the creator, the protectress and the reviver. Diamonds represent the power of Wisdom, Skill and Magic. The corresponding gods have to rely on physically stronger deities for protection so they can carry out their duties.\nAs the lord of the sun, I appear in a variety of forms. Some call me Ra, others refer to me as Horus. Call me as you like, but remember that it's me who steers the solar barque across the sky. I'm accompanied by multiple gods who assist me on this journey.\nAs a moon god and scribe for the gods, I accompany the lord of the sun during his nightly voyage. I keep him informed of what happens down on earth and in the lands of the dead.\nEvery night, the solar barque is attacked by a monstrous snake. I'm the protectress of the sun god and his scribe. Without my help, the sun would never make it's way through the dangerous nightlands.\nThe controversial aspects of life are represented by the blue suits. Spades are associated with Strength, Violence and Destruction. They feature the most powerful and reckless deities of ancient Egypt. Clubs represent the many facets of Death, including the rites and challenges a decedent undergoes after his/her death.\nI'm the fierce lioness, goddess of warfare and the vengeful aspect of the cat goddess. Once, I was sent to earth to destroy the mortals who conspired against the sun god. In my wrath, I destroyed almost all of humanity and let the Nile flow red.\nI'm the goddess of truth and justice. Your heart will be weighted against my feather. If you lived a virtouous life they will be in balance with eachother and you may hear your verdict from our lord. Else, your journey ends in the reeking maw of a deamoness.\nThis is merely a formality. If you passed every test so far, I can't hold anything against you. Come! I welcome you into my kingdom of eternal life!\nThe Jokers\nThe Aces\nBack Design (circular fan)\nBack Design (open fan)\nPip Cards\n\n\nTamarisk DELUXE Edition (Gold Foil & Embossing on Tuck Box)\nTamarisk DELUXE Edition\nTamarisk CLASSIC Edition\nI'm the ram-headed creator god and the guardian of the Nile's source. I created the bodies for gods and humans from the silt and clay that's washed out during the annual flood of the Nile.\nThe morning sun is embodied by me. Just like the scarab beetle pushes a dung ball, I lift the newly born sun over the horizon.\nI'm the goddess of life and magic. With the help of our divine scribe, I was able to mend and resurrect my slain husband.\nThe Nile is the source of life and growth for all of Egypt. At the same time it holds many unpredictable dangers and is home to a multitude of wild animals. As the god of the Nile, I'm both feared and worshipped at the same time.\nNo other god is feared as much as me! I'm the lord of the red desert, the bringer of chaos and the murderer of my gullible brother Osiris. I hacked him into pieces and scattered them all across egypt.\nFortunately, most of you won't suffer the same fate as Osiris. Still, one day you will find yourself before me. As the god of death it will be my task to guide you through your final judgement. I'm going to embalm and mummify your mortal body, so your heart and soul may proceed to their judgement.\nThe Aces\nBack Design (circular fan)\nBack Design (open fan)\nPip Cards\n\n The CardBack went through a multitude of different designs until it reached it's current and final state.

Therefore, I'm collaborating with experienced professionals who have been working in the playing cards industry for many years. The cards will be printed by USPCC, one of the worlds best renowned playing cards manufacturers. Fulfilment and shipping will be handled by Gambler's Warehouse. They are highly experienced in fulfilling Kickstarter projects in the playing cards industry.\n\nWe are aware, that due to the current COVID-19 situation, the level of unpredictability in the manufacturing process has heightened. We have added one month extra to the estimated fulfillment date. There's a good chance that we'll actually be able to fulfill in September, but the situation is changing daily. We will, of course, keep everyone informed of any changes.\n\nBe aware that printed colours could vary from the ones you see on your screen.

The turning point was the trip to Switzerland in 2019, where during a gloomy and rainy day I accidentally found the museum with an exhibition of gladiatorial armor. I am a big fan of Ridley Scott's films, and one of my favorite - the Gladiator. This exhibition in Switzerland impressed me so much that I started working on the deck dedicated to these strong and courageous men.\nThese decks will not be glamorous as the idea was to create a design that would reflect harsh reality of those difficult days and the strength of spirit of those brave warriors. The restrained and dark colors of the boxes, and the small accent on the foils, symbolize short and instantaneous eruption of glory at the peak of life and the brink of death.\nEveryone decides either to leave with honor, or to stain oneself with blood and shame. Eventually, the same thing awaits all of us - the death. It smiles at us, and all we have to do is to smile back.\nMain features:\nCards printed by EPCC.

We decided to create the world's first crypto card, which can be purchased on Kickstarter. \nWhat is the point, you ask? This is a completely new era of collecting, because now you can not only buy a crypto art, but also sell it legally!  If you have already heard about this kind of art, you understand what profits you can make by selling collectibles on NFT platforms. \n\nWe created a crypto pledge, and it is one of the aces of our deck. It has a three-dimensional format and an animated structure. You can purchase it in this project, and we'll send it to you at the end of the campaign. In addition to this crypto card, you will receive a large JPEG format of this card, which you can print for yourself.\nHowever, to receive crypto card, you will need a special crypto wallet. We will send your crypto card from the Rarible website and you will need the MetaMask wallet, which is one of the most common crypto currency wallets in the world.\n\nHow to creat a virtual wallet and to receive Crypto Card: \nFirst, we recommend you to read this article about crypto art: https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq\nBut, if you don\u2019t have much time, we prepared the FAQ list to make it easier for you to understand everything.\nWhat is NFT and crypto art:\n1) What does NFT mean?\nNFT stands for non-fungible token \u2013 a digital token that is a type of crypto currency, much like Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, unlike a standard coin in the Bitcoin blockchain, an NFT is unique and can't be exchanged like-for-like (hence, non-fungible).\n2) What is NFT Crypto ART?\nNFT stands for \u201cnon-fungible token,\u201d and it can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, animated GIFs, songs, or items in video games.\n3) How do NFT work?\nArtists who want to sell their work as NFTs have to sign up with a marketplace, then \u201cmint\u201d digital tokens by uploading and validating their information on a blockchain (typically the Ethereum blockchain, a rival platform to Bitcoin). They can then list their piece for auction on an NFT marketplace, similar to eBay.\n4) Where can I sell or buy NFT?\nThere is a variety of marketplaces on which to buy and sell NFTs: Nifty Gateway, MakersPlace, SuperRare, OpenSea, Decentraland, and Rarible are just a few of many.\nHow to creat a virtual wallet:\nHere is the official website where you can easily download and install your own crypto wallet: https://metamask.io\nIs MetaMask safe?\nMetaMask does not control any of your personal/private data on their servers. Everything is encrypted on your browser and protected via your MetaMask password. Therefore, when you lose your MetaMask accounts, and need to restore MetaMask, you could only do that with your seed phrase.\nAfter receiving this crypto card, you can trade it on crypto platforms, get crypto currency and buy anything!\nIf you have any questions, please write in the comments or in PMs. \nQuantity of copies is limited to 20 - be among the first!\nPLAY\n\n Like Lightning Playing Cards.

Whenever I have some spare time in between commissions, I would try to play around, and make something new and exciting.\n  The idea to create a full deck of playing cards, has long been a pet project of mine and is already in the final stages of design, and almost ready to be produced.\nThis is the part where you come into play! To make this a reality, I need some help from all illustration and playing card enthusiasts.

However, it was very hard to pick a theme among many different elements of Asian culture. Finally, my co-designer and I decided to create the Kasa playing cards. The playing cards set is inspired by the Japanese Noh plays (\u80fd\u697d) and its mask culture. Kasa (\u5098) means \"umbrella\" in Japanese, and it is the main inspiration of the card back.\nNoh or \u80fd is a Sino-Japanese word for \"skill\" or \"talent\". It plays a very major part of the classical Japanese musical drama that has been performed since the 14th century. Usually, the performers dress in traditional costume and wear strange-looking masks during the performance. The box art features 2 different masks depends on the deck: The white mask is a fox mask and the red one is a Tengu(\u5929\u72d7) mask.\nTwo colors of Kasa playing cards\nDark Kasa Playing Cards\n2,500 decks limited edition printed by USPCC\nBicycle branded\nPremium paper stock\nThin crushed for better handling \n      Backs with the traditional umbrella element\n    Jokers -- fox mask and tengu(\u5929\u72d7) mask\n            Wood Kasa Playing Cards\n2,500 decks limited edition printed by USPCC  \nBicycle branded  \nPremium paper stock  \nThin crushed for better handling\n    Backs with the traditional umbrella element\n    Jokers -- fox mask and tengu(\u5929\u72d7) mask\n            A Detailed Look\nWood Kasa , Clubs\n  Wood Kasa, Diamonds\n  Wood Kasa, Spades\n  Wood Kasa, Hearts\n  Wood Kasa, Jack of Spades\n  Wood Kasa, Back\n  Dark Kasa, Back\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Clubs\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Hearts\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Spades\n  Dark Kasa, Ace of Diamonds\n  Dark Kasa, 9s\nAdd-ons \n*Add-ons could be any Kasa decks in any combination.

I do have a small amount of unbranded Sky Descender and unbranded Samsara left, but, as you may notice, they are not included in this project. It is mainly because that I want to keep some of my decks as part of my collection. Branded Sky Descender and Samsara are so sold-out that I, as the creator, can't even afford to open a new deck :( Thus, this project is for Kasa only. I'm sorry if you are new to my cards, or maybe want to buy some of my previous decks.\nAlso, my friends always suggest me to make more cards at a time, at least more than 2,500 decks, but I refused. I do not plan to make a living solely from designing cards. It's just a hobby. I love collecting them and sometimes designing some, that's all.

Well i thought it did, and i was wrong!  \nTwo decades Lost ...\n17 years went by and I never touched magic, not even a french drop. One day my girlfriend found out I used to go to \"Hogwarts\" when I was younger and now I had to show her something. I only could remember one trick and it was her reaction to my performance that inspired all that I am doing right now. I even returned to the college to praise and thank my mentors for the huge impact they had in my life and how they played a massive part in who I am today; funny thing is I only realized all this a year ago!\nHere we are...\nJinto's and Jokers playing cards was created as a way of representing Cape Town and our street identity, the word \"jinto\" (thanks to my great friend Derra) in its harshest translation means Prostitute in Cape Afrikaans Slang, but it can also be used in a lighter term meaning hustler, which is what sleight of hand is built on, and what we here constantly find ourselves doing: Hustling. \nI really was lucky to have worked with such an amazing and gifted designer, Miss Kayleigh Garret, who got my ideas and made this beautiful deck come to life!

The Limited Ed. decks were being sold at really high prices (around 18$), with not the best quality and some of them had zero innovation: always the same designs, but different colours.\nThis made us think about our brand. \u00bfWhat were we going to do about it?\nAs a result, we changed completely our philosophy by not sticking to any philosophy. This might seem absurd, but in a world dominated by trends, we didn't want to follow any of them. This way, our brand will be offering each time completely different and new products, with the best possible quality at the lowest possible price, such as our new Juggler Marble Edition.\n\u00abprogress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything\u00bb - George Bernard Shaw\nBack Design\nINSPIRATION\nThe problem with new ideas that hasn't been done before is to think them.

We would like to thank all of our amazing backers for contributing to the unprecedented success of this project.\nFor anyone that missed the Luna Moon deck, you\u2019re not going to leave empty handed either. We present to all our supporters an extremely special Stretch Goal: an opportunity to obtain the Helius Sun deck. After the Moon sets, the Sun rises and brings us a new day and a fresh start filled with courage and excitement.\nHelius Sun Deluxe Edition\nAfter the Moon sets, the Sun rises and brings us a new day and a fresh start filled with courage and excitement. We originally planned on releasing the Helius Sun deck on the anniversary of the Luna Moon deck next year, but we received such overwhelming support in the first 48 hours of the launch we couldn\u2019t help but release it now. Since we are entering spring, we want to celebrate the warmth that we are about to receive and we hope that the new year can let you shine and prosper!\nClassic Edition (Left) & Deluex Edition (Right)\nThe Helius Sun Playing Card includes 2 versions: a Classic Edition (Left) and a Deluxe Edition (Right). The box for Helius Sun is just as special as Luna Moon, and incorporates some complimentary details. The Maroon Red box is reminiscent of the Sun\u2019s flaming heat. The rigid, hexagon opening represents the Sun\u2019s fierceness. The opening of the box is like sunray beaming towards us on Earth, providing the warmth and freedom that we so desperately after months of freezing cold.\nThe Helius Sun deck is extremely meaningful to us in a way since we incorporated a unforgettable sunrise we saw during a trip into the design. If you haven\u2019t had the opportunity yet, you absolutely must watch the sun rise from the horizon with someone you love. We promise you won\u2019t ever forget it.\nHelius Sun Classic Edition\nThe back of the cards is focused on illustrations of the Sun, but if you look very closely at there is a Moon crescent hugging the Sun. The flashes of red stars in the background hints at the many suns we see across the universe, and their powerful bursts are best captured in the crimson red. \n  The Joker is a flaming hot Sun with scorching rays emitting from the surface. The simple artwork at the corners are depictions of dawn and when the Sun rises, there is an alluring spectacle created and we wanted to capture that in the cards.\nThe Ace of Spades is taken from an altar on the highest mountain in China, TaiShan. It is a prime location to see the sunrise above the clouds and having travelled there ourselves it was a sight we cannot forget for the rest of our lives.\nThe inspiration for the deck is drawn from historical significance of the moon in both Western and Chinese culture. It is a symbol of change and repetitive cycles in life. The moon is associated with family, especially during the mid-autumn festival where mooncakes are to be eaten with a reunited family. \nThe moon waxes and wanes from empty to full and it\u2019s a great reflection of our lives. There are peaks and troughs in our lives through which we must progress and improve ourselves. But whenever we are too burdened with thoughts at night, gazing up at the moon removes all the unnecessary anxiety and clears the mind.\nToday, however, the moon is hidden behind city lights and skyscrapers. But if you ever feel the need at night, take some time to gaze at the moon. We hope it can bring clarity to you just as it has brought us.\nHere is the showcase video of Luna Moon Playing Cards, featuring the One and Only Joe Feldpausch (Instagram: Joefldpsch).\nIn the current environment, the design of playing card peripheral products have matured. It is very challenging to take a new path and especially create a new path, but someone has to confront the incumbent. After six months of brainstorming and design, Bocopo created this revolutionary deluxe case.\nLuna Moon Deluxe Edition\nThe Luna Playing Card includes 2 versions: a Classic case Edition (Left) and a Deluxe case Edition (Right). Both editions are highly limited with only 2500 each. Once the Kickstarter is end, the retail value will be Doubled.\nClassic Edition (Left) & Deluex Edition (Right)\nDeluxe Edition Luna Moon\nWe wanted to incorporate the different phases of the moon into the case, but it was extremely to show visually demonstrate in a normal case. An idea came to us while peeling an orange: to open the case with multiple layers and each layer representing a phase of the moon from empty to full.\nClassic Edition Luna Moon\n The case is fanned open to produce a stunning and dazzling experience. Through the gaps between the different cases, the different phases of the moon are uncovered. Every element of the case is a true testament to craftsmanship and imagination.\nThe back of the card is the view of the starry night sky looking into the Milky Way. With the sun is in the far distant background, the Moon shines guidance to all. The deep indigo background contrasts nicely with the golden light reflected off the Moon.\nThe Jokers consist of a Sun and Moon combo, for the Moon cannot shine without the Sun. The role of the two have been reversed in this theme, with the Moon having higher priority. We constructed orbiting planets around the Moon to express our admiration for the Moon and how it is under-appreciated by many. It can and should be worshipped as much as the Sun.\nThe Ace of Spades is like the letter A but with moonshine beaming from the Moon to the round Earth. The reflective light at guides those still awake at night and shines through the confusion hidden in the darkness.\n The Face cards for the deck are drawn without emotions or faces even. Instead, the highlight lies in the different white crescents. The mirrored streaks injects a sense of motion into the characters, and leaves their faces for your imagination.\nThe box of the Deluxe Editon is made from Kurz foil paper from Germany and Neenah Paper from France are carefully chosen to construct the case. These special materials each cost more than 7 times of regular supplies. Every box is completely hand-crafted by skilled artisans, and each takes 15 to 20 minutes to create. Their devotion and expertise can be felt from the moment you pick up the deck.\nThis is the Uncut Tuck Case of Luna Moon Deluxe Edition. This is an extremely rare item that we decided to make available to our supportive collectors ONLY on Kickstarter. When you pledge for the 6 sets or 12 sets tires of Luna Moon Playing Cards, this item will be Gifted to your collection and each sheet will be Numbered & Signed by Kevin Yu himself.\nThe Deck will be printed with USPCC, Air Cushion Finish, Casino Stock.

I admire these cards for their fidelity to the source material, rendering creatively and beautifully the myths of the Viking Age for a 21st-century card player. Of the projects I've consulted on, this is among my top favorites.\"  \nDr. Jackson Crawford, Instructor of Nordic Studies and Nordic Program Coordinator at the University of Colorado Boulder \nThe interest in the Norse gods has grown substantially in popularity from the emerging archeological finds, television shows, and Marvel movies. We are learning more about the Viking culture every day and people want more! We decided we wanted more as well - a playing card deck featuring a more authentic interpretation of the Norse gods. So, we went digging into the sagas and decided to create a deck based on the famous final battle of Ragnar\u00f6k.  \nThrough that research, we discovered Dr. Jackson Crawford, Instructor of Nordic Studies and Nordic Program Coordinator at the University of Colorado Boulder and author of The Poetic Edda: Stories of the Norse Gods and Heroes and The Saga of the Volsungs: With the Saga of Ragnar Lothbrok and a wealth of knowledge on everything Viking. \nWith Dr. Crawford's personal consulting and guidance for this project we were able to incorporate the correct, strict Old Norse names and descriptions for these mighty figures of legend, depictions so accurate to the original sources that Dr. Crawford has even suggested they be used in an academic environment!  \nThe outcome of all this work is a stunning deck that the gods themselves would be proud of - GJALLARHORN!\nWhat is GJALLARHORN?\nGJALLARHORN, or the Yelling Horn, is known by many as the horn wielded by Heimdallr to announce the coming of Ragnar\u00f6k.When sounded, all of the players of the final battle will gather; Odin, Thor, Loki, Hel, Tyr, and many others. Once gathered, the mighty battle will begin. Here, in this unique deck, we have gathered the deities and creatures who will play an important role in this battle. The GJALLARHORN is sounding! Will you join your fellow warriors in battle?\nA deck worthy of the gods! We have taken every step to ensure that the GJALLARHORN Deck will be the pinnacle of quality: \n\u25ba High Quality 310 gsm German card stock\n\u25ba Unique Norse mammen art style inspired box and card designs. \n\u25ba Gold/Silver foiled, embossed tuck boxes\n\u25ba 100% unique courts illustrated by hand in the Art Nouveau style\n\u25ba Gold/Silver metallic inks for card backs\n\u25ba 54 poker sized playing cards (52 cards + 2 jokers)\n\u25ba Printed by NPCC with premium linen finish\n\u25ba Savings on each deck with higher tier pledges\n\u25ba All artwork is complete and ready to print\n\u25ba Rewards shipped to backers in protective boxes\n* To add a deck to an existing pledge simply add $16 per deck.\nThe striking box design of the GJALLARHORN deck incorporates elements from the card back design to create a cohesive deck that is sure to inspire.

Welcome to the redesign Kickstarter launch for Grid Series Two, the typographic playing cards.  \nThe Grid playing cards are a three part collection based on the design principals of the International Typographic Style, otherwise known as the \u2018Swiss Style\u2019 of graphic design. Series Two has been reworked from its original launch because I wanted to refine the design and bring the whole deck closer to the original concept set out by Series One. I feel now, the whole deck has a cleaner more precise and elegant look, one that is important to have in every collection.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\nOriginally starting in the 1920s in Germany, the Netherlands and Russia, the \u2018Swiss Style\u2019 later developed in Switzerland in the 1950s. It\u2019s main principals are readability and cleanliness, with most creations adopting an asymmetric layout, always based on the use of a grid. These grids, usually made up of hidden columns and rows, are used to align words, numbers, pictures and patterns and so each series in the Grid collection adopts these principals. The works of designers such as Ernst Keller and Josef-M\u00fcller Brockmann have been a real inspiration from a graphic point of view. \nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nThe cards are poker size and printed by USPCC but are far from traditional. These cards will be printed on linen, magic air cushion stock which I know first hand really does feel like nothing else with fully customised tuck box and seal. As a graphic designer more than an illustrator, as well as a card collector, I wanted to find a way to combine two of my biggest passions and make a collection of decks which truly stand out from the crowd. I fully appreciate the incredible work of designers of other playing cards currently in the world, I am often drawn to the cards with incredible detail and illustration. After all, I am a Kickstarter backer as well as a creator. Personally, I see the detail of my decks as \u2018less is more\u2019, doing away with traditional pips and instead adopting a typographic format, with each card acting like a miniature poster, with bold words setting the theme rather than illustration and numbers.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nI have tried to keep the design minimal but functional, even the back of the card is super stripped back to just the name of the deck, with full colour bleed for real impact of colour. If, for example, you look at my version of the picture cards, they each have a diagonal line introduced as a minimal graphic, like a poster, but it replicates the diagonal line often found on traditional picture cards where the suit is duplicated and rotated. It\u2019s a small detail but it\u2019s my way of reflecting tradition.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nWith Grid Series Two, as well as vertical and horizontal alignment like in Grid Series One, I have introduced the circle to create a dial effect and explore how different grids can be adopted on playing cards. Each card has a bespoke set of alignment with the numbers and letters that sit on the edge of the circle so that they visually look to have the same alignment, whilst not always sitting in exactly the same place on each card.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\nThe cards can be read and viewed in many different ways with only two being symmetrical.\nA) The card is written in it\u2019s full name; seven of diamonds. \nB) Traditional use in the corners with 7 and the diamond pip. \nC) Written with upper and lowercase next to it; Seven / Diamonds. \nD) Around the circle there is the current sequence of cards before and after; 6 7 8. \nE) Short hand code in the upper right corner; se/di \nF) In the lower left corner similar to Grid Series One, the current card is shown by the pip and lit up dots, with ones that don\u2019t apply being faded out for ace to ten, and then switching to diagonal lines for the picture cards; diamond pip with 7 white dots.\nGrid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Standard Edition\n  Each backer will receive 2 free phone background images of their selected cards available for download, as well as a PDF certificate of gratification to download. This is to say thank you and will include your name and backer number. Backers who would like these bonus items just need to message me after funding to confirm selection and I can send the files to them.\nTwo custom phone backgrounds for every backer\n   Signed Standard Edition\nIf you would like your deck signed, simply increase your pledge by \u00a35 per deck and message me to confirm this add on. You will be able to choose where the deck is signed and if you would like it resealed with protective plastic cellophane.\nLimited Edition\nThe limited edition Grid Series Two deck is an extremely rare product. There will only be 20 made, they will also never be printed again. These will be printed on professional grade plastic coated, lower stock than the standard edition, the same I used for Series One limited edition, this is purely because the print run is so small, I need to use a different printer to get them made. From previous campaigns, I know these are highly sought after, so keeping them so limited increases their exclusivity.\nUpdate - I did post this in my first update but thought best to note it here as well; the limited edition decks are currently all reserved, but if you would like to be added to the waiting list please still do message me!\nGrid Series Two - Limited Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Limited Edition\nEvery deck will be numbered and signed in a place of the backers choice. There is no limit to how many decks each backer can request out of the 20 made. Every deck will come with a printed certificate of ownership, signed and numbered to match the deck.\nGrid Series Two - Limited Edition\n  Grid Series Two - Limited Edition\nEach deck will cost \u00a325 which includes delivery and certificate of ownership. If you would like to add on any limited edition decks, please private message me directly to reserve a deck and be added to the waiting list.

I graduated in graphic design in 2017 and decided to start as a freelance and realize my own projects. With my Micron pen and my paper, I am giving life to my universe by drawing inspiration from my surroundings. The nature and animals are very present in my drawings that are often full of details, in black and white, sometimes with hints of red. I also use a lot of dotwork and geometrical elements.\nPackaging of LM Playing Cards\nQUEL EST MON PROJET ? / WHAT'S MY PROJECT ?\nMon projet est un jeu de 54 cartes ayant une illustration unique pour chacune d\u2019entre elles. \u00c0 travers ces cartes, vous trouverez une invitation \u00e0 l\u2019aventure, au voyage. Ici se m\u00ealent principalement faune et flore dans un imaginaire tout en d\u00e9tails et en po\u00e9sie. Ce projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u dans l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019aborder le jeu de cartes sous un angle diff\u00e9rent, plut\u00f4t comme un objet de collection avec lequel on pourrait jouer comme on le souhaite. Dans ce jeu, chaque valeur correspond \u00e0 un th\u00e8me, pour certains plus abstraits que d\u2019autres. Les voici : \n 2 : des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles faisant un clin d\u2019oeil \u00e0 des moments ou des personnes qui ont contribu\u00e9es de pr\u00e8s ou de loin \u00e0 la mise en forme de ce projet \n3 : la mer, l\u2019oc\u00e9an \n4 : les 4 \u00e9l\u00e9ments \n5 : le road trip \n6 : le temps, l\u2019attente \n7 : l\u2019espace, l\u2019astronomie \n8 : la l\u00e9g\u00e8ret\u00e9, la fragilit\u00e9 \n9 : les 4 saisons \n10 : l\u2019exotisme, l\u2019\u00e9cologie \nValets/reines/rois : les animaux incarnants pour moi les caract\u00e9ristiques de ces valeurs \nAs : la repr\u00e9sentation des 4 techniques principales que j\u2019utilise dans mes dessins (g\u00e9ometrie, dotwork, aplats, d\u00e9tails au trait) \nJoker : une vision fantaisiste et personnelle des jokers avec la folie et la festivit\u00e9 de la bi\u00e8re, la malice et l\u2019intelligence du raton laveur  \nMy project is a deck of 54 playing cards with a unique illustration for each one. These cards are an invitation to adventure and travel. Flora and fauna combine in an imagination all in details and poetry. This project was conceived by thinking of playing cards from a different angle, much more like an collector's item that you could manipulate and play with as you like. In this deck, each value represents a theme, some more abstract than others :\n 2 : personal references to moments or people that contributed to this whole project in a way or another \n3 : the sea, the ocean \n4 : the 4 elements \n5 : road trip \n6 : time and its course \n7 : space and astronomy \n8 : lightness and fragility \n9 : the 4 seasons \n10 : exotism, ecology \nJacks / Queens / Kings : i tried to pick subjects that reflects the figures' characteristics \nAces : the representation of the 4 main techniques that i use: geometric, dotwork, patches and details with lines \nJokers : a fancy and personal vision of the jokers with the pep and festivity of the beer, and the mischief and cunning of the raccoon.\nAces\n  Some of the cards\n  Queen of Spades\n  Jokers\nL\u2019id\u00e9e de ce projet m\u2019est venue il y a maintenant 2 ans et demi. En suivant le travail de l\u2019illustrateur Kerby Rosanes qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un jeu de cartes avec plusieurs autres artistes (Playing Arts), j\u2019ai trouv\u00e9 cette nouvelle vision des cartes absolument g\u00e9niale. Color\u00e9e, surprenante, unique. L\u2019envie de cr\u00e9er mon propre jeu de cartes est donc venue tout naturellement. J\u2019ai d\u2019abord cr\u00e9e une premi\u00e8re version enti\u00e8rement \u00abfait maison\u00bb puis, sous les conseils de mes proches, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de le retravailler pour l\u2019imprimer et le commercialiser. Les photos que vous pouvez voir sont le prototype du jeu qui va donc \u00eatre imprim\u00e9. \nThe idea of the project came to me 2 and a half years ago. Then, following the example of Illustrator Kerby Rosanes who participated to the creation of a deck of cards (Playing Arts), along with several other artists, I found that new vision absolutely awesome. Colorful, surprising, unique. The desire of creating my own deck therefore came rather naturally. I made a first homemade version, then under the advice of my friends and family, I decided to rework it in order to print and commercialize it. The photos you see are from the prototype of the deck that is going to be printed.\nPrototype\n     Back of the cards\n QUEL EST MON PLAN ET MON BUDGET ? / WHAT'S MY PLAN AND MY BUDGET ?\nPour imprimer ce jeu de cartes, j\u2019ai choisi Cartamundi qui existe depuis 1765 et qui est reconnu pour la qualit\u00e9 de ses services, ayant notamment travaill\u00e9 pour Monopoly, Uno, Pokemon et bien d\u2019autres. C\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que je me lance dans un tel projet et pour une premi\u00e8re impression j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de commencer avec 250 exemplaires, comprenant les cartes (56x87mm) et leur \u00e9tui. D\u00e8s la fin du Kickstarter, apr\u00e8s l\u2019impression r\u00e9alis\u00e9e et les jeux de cartes r\u00e9ceptionn\u00e9s, je m\u2019attelerai \u00e0 l\u2019envoi des commandes (pour la livraison il faut compter d\u00e9but mars). Pour les retardataires n\u2019ayant pas pu commander leur jeu via Kickstarter, il vous sera possible de vous le procurer sur le site Etsy qui permet aux cr\u00e9ateurs et aux artistes de vendre leurs cr\u00e9ations. Il sera vendu au m\u00eame prix qui est de 20\u20ac. Mais pour r\u00e9aliser ce projet, j\u2019ai besoin de votre aide ! En effet, les fonds r\u00e9colt\u00e9s serviront \u00e0 payer : \nl\u2019impression des cartes et de leur \u00e9tui \nles frais d\u2019envoi \nles frais d\u2019emballage \nles frais mat\u00e9riel \nEt si jamais l\u2019objectif se voit d\u00e9pass\u00e9, une quantit\u00e9 plus importante de jeux de cartes pourra \u00eatre imprim\u00e9e, une autre version du jeu pourra \u00eatre envisag\u00e9 (coffret, \u00e9dition sp\u00e9ciale, planches non d\u00e9coup\u00e9es de toutes les cartes ...), voir m\u00eame des collaborations.\nTo print this deck, I chose Cartamundi, which exists since 1765 and is recognized for the quality of its services, having worked for Monopoly, Uno, Pokemon and many others. It's the first time that I am realizing a project like this and for a first order, I decided to start with 250 decks, comprised of the cards (56x87mm) and their case. Once the Kickstarter ends and after the packs are printed and delivered to me, I will then procede to send all the orders (you will have to wait early march for the delivery). For those late to the party that couldn't order their game through Kickstarter, It will still be possible to order it on Etsy, a website made for creators and artists to sell their work. It will be sold to the same price of 20\u20ac. But to finalize this project, I need your help ! The funds gathered will be used to pay :\nThe printing of the cards and cases\nThe expedition fees\nThe packing fees\nThe materials cost\nThe printing of the cards and cases The expedition fees The packing fees The materials cost If the funds gathered exceed what i expected, a bigger quantity of decks could be printed, other variations could be considered (luxury box, other versions, uncut sheets, ...) or even collaborations.\n  All the cards of the game\nVous pouvez voir mon travail sur les diff\u00e9rentes plateformes ci-dessous.\nYou can look at my work on the different platforms below. \nInstagram\nDeviantArt\nTumblr\nBehance \nPinterest \nFacebook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJe me suis document\u00e9e du mieux possible, j\u2019ai contact\u00e9 dif\u00e9rentes personnes ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 ou cr\u00e9\u00e9 un projet comme celui-ci.

With shades of cherry wine red and buttery yellow, the colours complement one another and fuse to create a unique pattern. This harmonious composition awakes the sense of a warm winter, thus; \u201cWinter Warmth\u201d.  \nThe design \nWe wanted to continue the trend of assembling diamonds together in such a way that it creates a geometrically pleasing pattern with vivid colours that pop when fanned, flourished and dealt. This time around we decided to change the index to the traditional font to make it easier to play with. We continue to work with the quality of the USPCC to ensure that the cards are top-class. This guarantees that N\u00b0 5 will be even better than the previous version N\u00b0 2.\n*Note that most of the the pictures still work with the old index. See picture below for the updated index.\n    The cards will be printed on Bicycle grade stock by the United States Playing Card Company with the renowned Air-cushion finish. Additionally, the cards will retain the crushed stock and traditional cut. This will guarantee outstanding handling so you can perform with ease. One deck contains 56 uniquely designed playing cards and a custom tuck box.\nN\u00b0 5 & N\u00b0 2 Reward Tier\nDidn't have the chance to get your hands on our first deck?

Throughout the campaign we will post occasional updates, so you can stay up to date with what is going on on our side.

A savage, no-holds-barred design that captured the authentic, uncaged outlaw spirit and the fierce freedom these born-to-ride rebels live for.\nThe Outlaw artwork is in the hands of the big dogs at the U.S Playing Card Co. They're ready to crank up their gears and print these bad boys at the highest quality, however...\n...there's just one rebel in my crew missing. You.\nLike every deck I create, I've invested hundreds of hours, days and nights into designing the Outlaws. It's my passion, but they'll never become a reality without you.  By becoming a backer you're giving me the critical support I need to pay for the entire production and bring this deck to life.  If you're down to ride with me, grab some rebel Outlaw decks from the reward tiers and share the project with a friend, I can't do this without you.\n It's time to play a little dangerously.\nFor the hell-raisers who live on the edge...The wild ones, trouble-makers, rebels and risk-takers... these are the Outlaw playing cards.\nA vicious, striking black and white design with an authentic armory of iconic outlaw motorcycle club details. With a sharp, custom bordered edge to set it off, the Outlaws are a savage feat of design bad-assery with a gritty wildness that commands attention and roars with attitude. \n Caged in a heavyweight, raw, smokey matte black tuck box, every fine detail of the design will be stamped in a lighting-white foil with precision embossing all around. We\u2019re crafting a metallic black and silver foil deck seal to keep these troublemakers protected, featuring a custom die-cut edge design you won\u2019t find anywhere else out there.\nA Motorcycle Club ain't worth a damn if you don't have an Official Club patch. The most iconic card in the deck, the Ace of Spades is emblazoned with the fearless skull and spade rider patch to show the world who you ride or die for.\nInked up and armed to the teeth, this is a serious band of mofos. A custom-illustrated rebel crew of court cards in authentic leather \u2018cuts\u2019 and official club patches. Scarred, smoking and dangerously good looking, the Outlaw court cards feature some of the most bad ass Jacks, beautiful Queens and toughest Kings you\u2018ll ever deal with.\nNo Outlaw is complete without their F.T.W. patch (which stands for \u201cf*** the world\u201d, but you knew that). The Outlaw Joker is a down and dirty rebel-twist on the old-school Bicycle\u00ae 808 Rider Back Joker we know and love. Instead of riding some punk bicycle, we\u2019ve got our leather-clad Outlaw King thundering down the highway on his iron steed, flipping off the entire world as he goes. That\u2019s one bad hombre.\nIn true Outlaw style, I've kept it gritty, real and raw. The faces are bold, straight-talkin\u2019 and a lil' rough around the edges. A custom but classic pip design in blood red, and deep black with a worn texture. A functional layout, they\u2018re strong and stylised but clear and easy to read no matter what your game. Even at 5 am in the bar all whiskey\u2019d up after one helluva night. \nWhether your game is poker, magic or cardistry, the Outlaws are down to ride with you \u2018till the end.\nLike any free-wheelin' Outlaw knows, standard just doesn\u2019t cut it. Packin' attitude in every deck, these bad boys are nothin\u2019 but custom from the ground up. With the U.S. Playing Card Co, Clove St. Press and Art of Play involved in manufacturing this deck at the highest standards, the Outlaw deck will be one serious weapon of mass deception.\nFEATURES\nA vicious, custom-edged bordered back design, it's authentic to its outlaw core. A rebel design that strikes fear into the squares of society, it's a wild ride of a back design.\nWith fully-custom designed faces, Outlaw features 12 illustrated bad-ass court cards, 40 bold 'n' gritty faces, 2 rebel rider jokers, a custom Ace of Spades club patch design and a special \"db\" gaff card.\nThe playing cards will be printed by the big dogs themselves, the U.S. Playing Card Co. at the highest production quality. Original rebel motorcycle clubs were born on US soil, so it only makes sense.\nPrinted on a Premium, Casino-Grade CRUSHED card stock with signature Air-Cushion Finish and a Traditional Cut, it's the smoothest ride out there. A deck made just the way the card gods intended.\nArmoured by a premium weight, extra tough, smokey midnight matte black tuck box with a lightning white foil stamp and registered embossing crafted by the letterpress artisans at Clove St. Press. \nProtected by a metallic black and silver foil seal, custom-made from a unique die-cut of our own design. You won\u2019t catch anyone else out there with one like it. \nProfessionally assembled and wrapped for protection by the in-house experts at Art of Play, ready for carefully packing and shipping to you. \n*Please note: I've done my best to showcase the deck accurately in the mock-up photographs above but some details may be subject to change during the production process. I guarantee any changes will be minor in appearance and only implemented to add value and/or improve. It will not lower the overall design or impact at all.\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your main reward tier from right, you can always add-on extra items (listed below). This is how...Step 1) Simply add up the total cost of your chosen add-ons using prices for either a US or International backer. 2) Find your chosen Reward Tier from the list on the right (you must already have chosen a reward). 3) click to edit it. 4) manually add that extra cost on top of your total pledge.\nPlease remember what items you added the extra money for (e.g. 1 t-shirt,1 uncut sheet 1 extra deck, US shipping ), so later you can specify exactly which items the extra funds are for on the survey.\n              Once the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will be using a great service called BackerKit to help manage all pledges, specifically helping to choose any add-ons and extras, finalize/update addresses etc. Each backer will be sent an invite to a BackerKit survey once Kickstarter has processed all funds.\n  I'll also be working with the seasoned pro's at Art of Play in California to help us safely ship all rewards from the U.S. to the world.  This means we've also included US shipping for all reward tiers. And that cost is further used to subsidise international shipping for Non-US backers based on Art of Play's rates.\nArt of Play are a Dan & Dave company, known and trusted experts in the playing card industry and are responsible for safely shipping thousands of premium playing cards to customers around the world every month, so we'll be in good hands. As elements of the deck are actually being produced and finished in California too, it will also serve to minimise the moving parts of the process and keep production as streamlined and effective as possible.\nKnow someone who'd like this deck?\n  Whether you get your kicks from cards, magic, or cardisty, design, poker, or motorbikes, I hope the Outlaws will give you one more damn good reason to crack open a new deck and do what you enjoy. If you're down to ride, grab a few decks and share the project with your squad to help me make it happen. I can't do it without your support. Thank you,\nLee\nFollow along with me at Kings & Crooks for more playing card photography, updates and announcements along the way:\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third project on Kickstarter, and 5th deck that I've produced so far. I'm familiar with navigating the entire process and although I'm based in Australia, I have developed good relationships with the US playing card co and other US-based suppliers, which has allowed me to successfully make and ship thousands of decks to backers in the US and around the world without any major issues. \n\nAlthough having the tuck box printed and assembled outside of USPC is a new element of production to me, the suppliers I'm working with (Clove St. Press and Art of Play) are very experienced and set up to complete exactly what's required, so I don't foresee any problems.\n\nAny potential challenges that arise will always be communicated to my backers along the way via the project updates. I'm certainly not a project creator who will leave you hanging for the entire 30 days with zero communication. (But I also won't blast you with unnecessary updates too)\n\nDuring my last project to create a card clip/holder, I experienced significant challenges, delays and huge personal loss in bringing it to fruition. However, the actual playing card element of the project (and t-shirts, coins, uncut sheets), were produced without issue. Concerning the card clip accessory, I never quit, and after great pains, I'm happy to say we are now on the road to completion after all.\n\nI mention this to be fully transparent and show I will do what it takes to honor my promise to you. Choosing to back me with your hard-earned money is not something I take lightly. You can expect total honesty and my dedicated devotion to successfully producing and delivering this project to you.
