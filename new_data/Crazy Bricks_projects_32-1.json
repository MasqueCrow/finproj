[{"backer": "Crazy Bricks", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Blindly serve a dreadful god and lead its cult in a fresh multiplayer take on the roguelike genre inspired by Pikmin.\nDon the robe of a cultist and ready your ceremonial dagger to serve the old god of your choosing in the grim universe of Worship. Your deity will deign to share a glimpse of its might to his cult, in exchange for blind devotion. Explore the world around your cult and find ways to please your god, convert the locals into followers and master the art of drawing with blood to use powerful rituals. As devotion grows towards your unholy divinity, you get stronger alongside the cult until you finally have the power to summon your god and cause the end of the world.\nIf being the sole herald of the apocalypse frightens you, fret not for Worship will feature fully fledged online and local multiplayer! You will be able to start a cult of up to 4 players!\nWorship is scheduled for release in 2022 on PC and Consoles.\nPreparing rituals is the bread and butter for devoted cultists. Harness the occult powers granted by your deity through bloody ceremonies and sacrifices. By spilling blood while moving, you can draw symbols on the ground and then activate them to invoke your god\u2019s divine powers.\nRituals are Worship's take on casting spells and it also enables various ways to have fun with the drawing mechanic such as solving puzzles and more! Rituals are designed with cooperative play in mind, because nothing is more fun than painting with your friend's blood!\nHow it Works\n First, you use your ceremonial dagger to start dripping blood on the ground. \n Secondly, while bleeding, you leave a blood trail on the ground as your character moves. Draw with your blood this way.\n Finally, you can activate a ritual while near or inside a drawn symbol to activate your god's magic.\nThe effect of a spell depends on the symbol drawn. Ritual activations will tolerate inaccuracies, but if the drawing isn't close enough to the target symbol or if too much excess blood clutter the ground, the ritual will fail to activate. When this happens, blood recall can be used to \"fix\" parts of the symbol or to erase it completely and start over the drawing.\nBasic rituals\nBasic rituals are the ones every cultist has access to from the start, regardless of the god they worship. These rituals are essential for basic tasks and utility. They include the follower conversion ritual, the building ritual, and a combat ritual.\nAdvanced rituals\nOther more powerful and diverse rituals can by learned by gaining devotion levels, exploring the world and defeating enemies. The effects of these rituals are designed to be fun to use and emergent. Turn your followers into deadly horrors, transform your spilled blood into black flames, infuse enemies with madness and more!\nAs a cultist, you are serving an old god and leading a cult, but followers are what gives you the means to spread your cult\u2019s influence. Follower management is a core game mechanic in Worship and a powerful tool for your cult. You hold influence over all converted followers and can command them with simple orders. The easiest way to understand their purpose and the ways they will be used in Worship is by making a comparison with one of our inspirations; Pikmin! Followers can be likened to the adorable creatures from the beloved Nintendo franchise. Calling them to follow you, making them interact with various buildings and objects, bringing them into battle and using these hollow husks mercilessly are among the things you can do with these faithful bastards.\nConverting the godless into followers\nInstead of relying on traditional resource gathering like most survival or strategy games, in Worship you need to submit the godless to your deity's will, turning them into followers. As a key component for a game about cultists, we wanted the act of converting followers to be more engaging than pressing a button. For this reason, the potential recruits you will encounter while exploring won't always be the same. Each type of godless will have their quirks and behavior that will require different strategies to submit them to the conversion ritual. \nTo spread devotion towards your god, you will need to explore the world, converting followers and finding ways to make your cult stronger. Get your followers and rituals ready and prepare to stumble upon enemies to fight, but also into unexpected and fun encounters. Expect hand-crafted puzzles, unique landmarks, secrets and flavorful events involving the world\u2019s factions. There is plenty of reasons to discover the world around your altar and every time you start a new cult will be different with partially procedurally generated environments combined with hand crafted elements.\nPuzzles\nThe puzzles you will find while exploring will take many shapes and forms. Use logic combined with a skillful use of game mechanics such as commanding followers and drawing with blood to overcome deadly sets of traps and complex contraptions from extinct civilizations. Claim rewards such as devotion gains, new followers, blessings, and for the more complex ones, new rituals.\nLandmarks and secrets\nIf you are the kind of player that enjoys exploring and charting your surroundings in games, looking for surprising finds, your curiosity will be satiated by the discovery of mysterious landmarks. A quantity of these areas are tied to opposing factions and can influence how they interact with your cult. Some might even be pieces of a larger puzzle needed to achieve the ultimate objective of summoning your god. Lastly, some will hold deep secrets that await your discovery. Experiment on these landmarks with the tools at your disposition and reveal their true purpose. Get rewarded with new means to shape the course of the game and grasp knowledge that will impact your subsequent attempts at leading a cult. \nRandom events and encounters\nFinally, it goes without saying that being a cultist leading a bunch of fanatics will bring some conflicts your way. You will need to be prepared to fight mobs of angry peasants, hungry beasts, church inquisitors, and, as the barriers between the mortal realm and the world of the old gods grow thinner: unspeakable horrors. Aside from battles, our design philosophy was to make the world feel more alive with the inclusion of random events with the various factions. These events encountered while roaming the world are built to be fun and impactful for your cult while contributing to the worldbuilding. \nCombat in Worship plays out by combining follower management with rituals while under pressure. This results in a challenge based on strategy and execution in real time that rewards team play, good follower management and fast thinking. Telegraphed attacks and warnings for bigger area of effects makes it a test of skills to survive combat while keeping most of your followers alive. Combat has many purposes in Worship; it can serve as a landmark challenge, a way to spice up exploration or to threaten your cult\u2019s base and more.\nOne the of deadliest horror you'll have to fight against: the Scarlet Behemoth\nBuildings\nBuilding monuments and structures for the cult around your altar is an important part of the gameplay loop and progression in Worship. Each basic building provides utilities like increased max followers count, faster blood regeneration and more. Advanced buildings made with special resources gives upgrades to the cult such as new rituals, buffs to followers or cultists and other impactful effects. If the buildings are destroyed, your cult loses access to the utility or bonus they provided. On the upside, you'll have dozens of obedient fanatics to repair them for you!\nDevotion\nYour god\u2019s influence over the mortal realm is measured by devotion. The more you increase devotion towards your god, the more they can manifest and share their power. Prove your faith and earn enough devotion to level up the cult, giving you access to a blessing of your choice. The blessings available depends on the god worshiped, ranging from catalysts to cult passive bonuses and even ways to alter the game world.\nYou earn devotion by executing various acts of faith. Converting followers, solving puzzles and bringing relics to the altar are various ways to increase devotion. Each god also has their own goals and rewards with more devotion specific actions that relate to those objectives.\n Player progression\nYour devotion and triumphs in the world of Worship will be duly rewarded. To this end, the game will feature a set of objectives that reward you with cosmetics to c ustomize your cultist, skins for your followers and blood effects. You might even unlock new gods to worship. These objectives may carry across your playthroughs as some are tied to long term goals. In other cases, a couple of objectives will have you go out of your way to accomplish a specific feat. Look forward to these challenges if you needed more reasons to dive back into blind fanaticism! \nUnlockable skins for the disciples of the old gods Hubryus and An-Ansgaidh\nNow that you have delved into the occult mechanics and systems Worship has to offer, you might wonder how it all plays out. Fret not, the old gods have not forsaken thee for they have left us with an illustrated diagram that gives some insight on how your Worship experience should unfold.\nAfter choosing the old god your cult worships, you will find yourself at the main altar of your eldritch overlord, alongside any fellow cultist in your party. From there:\nExplore the world, searching for followers to convert and ways to increase devotion towards your god.\nStumble upon enemies, encounter the world factions, and face many potential threats to your cult and your mortal life.\nYour god won\u2019t be satisfied with you only surviving. Go out of your way to make your cult grow by expanding your base around the altar and amassing a mob of faithful fanatics. Doing so will allow you to learn new rituals and make both cultists and followers stronger.\nYou'll do all of this while keeping your ultimate goal in mind: finding a way to summon your god into the mortal realm, ending the world as you know it\nIn addition to being multiplayer with up to 4 players, Worship is also designed with spectators and streamers in mind. At Chasing Rats Games, we believe in the importance of streaming in the current landscape of the videogame industry. We are dedicated to creating games that are awesome to play but also fun to watch. To this end, Worship will feature a fully fledged and customizable streamer mode that will enable various interactions between streamers and their viewers. \nHere are a few examples of what we have in mind: followers named after subscribers watching, monuments reacting to chat chanting the inscription written on them, viewers voting for the faction that will appear in the next event, puzzles where the chat controls objects or traps akin to \u201cTwitch Plays\u201d and more! We also want to implement a system that would allow donations to have a gameplay impact, which we think would benefit both streamers and fans while making a great spectacle.\nWorship takes place in a time in which humanity is struggling to step forward, trying to leave the harshness of a dark age behind. Shackled in a time of poverty and ignorance by the church and others who fear change, most do not have the luxury to think further than day to day survival. Small villages and isolated communities are dispersed on more hospitable lands, with a few cities starting to appear. Most have forgotten how things were before, with only several scattered ruins and fewer living beings bearing testaments of times past. Creeping fog rises in dark corners of the lands, while gods from another world await an opportunity to extend their influence unto the mortal realm. Mystery, horror, fantasy and a smidge of humor meet to create the grim medieval world of Worship.\nThe old gods, immortal entities beyond comprehension of the human mind, dwell on another plane of existence that intersects with the mortal realm. Long ago, humanity worshiped these gods, which nearly brought them to extinction. Since then, most traces of this dark past were destroyed by the church. To even know the existence of these pagan gods is considered heresy in the eyes of the inquisition. As for the gods themselves, they don\u2019t process the world, emotions and desires the same way humans do. Because of their tremendous power and warped minds, their involvement with the mortal realm always led to gruesome outcomes for its inhabitants, despite them not being inherently evil.\nWhile they all reign on the same mysterious plane, the old gods are vastly distinct beings. They all have their own identities, intentions and strengths. As such, here are a few whose altars and shrines of yore still remain in the mortal realm:\nGameplay impact\nWorshipping the sower of insanity is to embrace the transformation of all things, to plunge the world into madness. The acts of devotion he will reward most include corrupting the godless into followers but also changing initial world tendencies. Be on your toes when you pledge allegiance to Hubryus because you might encounter more unspeakable horrors than usual. As his devotion in the mortal realm increases, his power will manifest itself, warping inhabitants and beasts alike into nightmares. When it comes advanced rituals, there will be a focus on transformation and alterations rituals. Warp your followers into horrific thralls and change the course of battles with mind shattering metamorphosis.\nGameplay impact\nCults devoted to the Apostle of Deliverance have adopted his twisted vision. His followers have their sights on the extinction of sentient life, and as such they are fearsome warriors. Acts of faith for An-Ansgaidh are of the murdery kind. Killing will reward more devotion, but so will sacrificing followers and \u201csetting free\u201d the godless instead of converting them. Being faithful to this old god also means that death is sacred and liberated souls are to be left untouched. No necromancy ritual will be available and resurrecting allied cultists is to be punished. An-Ansgaidh is the deity with the vastest choice of offensive rituals, which will make your cult a force to be reckoned with.\nGameplay impact\nWhen you Worship Salithys, you willingly become the most important pawn in her intricate plan. As a reward, you get to lead the only cult that knows and embraces the true nature of the manipulative old god. Using followers as your own puppets will reward more devotion when they complete meaningful tasks for you. Obeying the whispers of Salithys will also offer more rewards than other deities. Worshipping the Deceit Weaver also makes the church less of a menace and even sometimes allies when she deems it necessary. This has the effect of making the coven particularly heinous and dangerous for your cult. While she prefers resorting to deceit and cunning, Salithys has plenty of powerful rituals to offer her faithful. Mind control, powerful healing, and even resurrecting the dead are among her rituals of choice. Injury and death are no reason to escape her rule.\nGameplay Impact\nThe cultists connoisseurs that worship Glub seek to prepare his arrival by amassing the biggest mob of followers the world has ever seen. His faithful are blessed with potent summoning rituals and bountiful blessings. Smother your foes under swarms of toads, buff your many followers and summon gargantuan blobfishes to help you in battle. As his title suggests, Glub will reward with more devotion each new follower birthed from your cult and will also increase the rate at which they are spawned from the appropriate buildings. Incidentally, you will find fewer potential followers while exploring since most of the godless will avoid your rapidly expanding dank empire.\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign, piece together with the community a new old god that will appear in the game! Make your voice heard by joining our community Discord server to vote for your favorite entries or enter the contest with your own. All the information about the event is in the #kickstarter-god-polls channel.\nThe world of Worship is home to several factions that make it feel truly alive and dynamic throughout your games. Some factions are organized groups while others are clusters of a similar kind. You will encounter all of them in due time while exploring the world and growing your cult. Sometimes, they will simply be enemies, while other times, you\u2019ll be able to interact with them through game mechanics. Know that your gameplay actions and decisions towards factions will influence the game world and how these groups see and interact with your cult.\nAs you might have noticed, Worship's art direction is one that is rarely seen in today's ocean of video games. We wanted to make sure our take on the whole cultist genre would stand out from the competition. We decided to go with simple black and white tones mixed with specks of color for the sake of clarity. The main splash of pigment is a bright and striking red, brought to the game by the gallons of blood spilled in the name of the cult.\nThis black and white look was widely inspired by games such as Hidden Folks and KIDS. As for the characters, we aimed for a simple and friendly design with a slightly unsettling touch. A prime example of this would be the little followers that accompany you everywhere you go. Short, simple minded, happy folks with a penchant for destruction and stabbing things.\nParticular attention to music and sound design is a defining characteristic of our company's productions with the amazing L\u00e9andre Monette at the helm of the audio department. Music and audio aren\u2019t an afterthought for us, as we try to use sound design in innovative ways to elevate the gameplay experience. We will once again use Wwise engine to bring to life Worship's soundscape in the way it deserves.\n\nThe critically acclaimed Struggling OST was the musical embodiment of the philosophy behind the game and we seek to do the same with Worship. L\u00e9andre is at work to produce the ultimate cultist game soundtrack with influences and instruments from all over the world. Dive right away into some amazing pieces he composed for the game.\n1. Eldritch Cataclysm: Humanity fell into madness as the towering Eldritch God gazed upon them, passing through the portal.\n2. Clad in Gold and Lies: The church leaves no sinner unpunished and its inquisition tolerates no witches unburnt.\n3. Forbidden Legends: Some myths are better left forgotten and old gods left asleep.\nNew Track Revealed:\n 4. Innocent Blood: Behind the face of an angel lies a deadly mix of absolute devotion and lack of survival instinct.\nAs we did for Struggling, which was translated in 11 languages, we will make sure to work with reputable localization teams to translate the game in as many languages as possible. It is important to us that the game be accessible and localization surely has a big role in that aspect. We can\u2019t currently confirm which languages will make the cut aside from english, but we will definitely monitor the community\u2019s thoughts and requests to make our selection. \nWith Worship, our intention is to release the game on PC and consoles. We only need to determine which consoles will be the smartest choices at the time of Worship's release in 2022 considering how the market is evolving. It is important to us that we satisfy our backers in this regard so don't hesitate to make your voice heard here on Kickstarter or on our Discord server. We will monitor closely what the community wants and keep you updated on the matter as the production moves forward.\nWe are Chasing Rats Games, the passionate team behind Worship and the abomination of a game Struggling. With our industry veterans and our new blood alike, we aim to bring to life games that break the mold and that are as fun as refreshing. The team is super excited to be working on a game as wild as Worship and we want to put in the time and resources needed to fulfill our vision of the game, improved by the community feedback we'll get along the way.\nEach member of the team is driven by a passion for our craft and the will to deliver kickass games that strive to bring something different to the industry. We are now ready to push things further and put all hands on deck for the production of Worship.\nThis is where we humble brag and try to reassure you that the team is talented by showing some awards we won with our previous game, Struggling. We do what we do because we love to create games and we seek to deliver experiences that will resonate with gamers across the globe.\nWhy Kickstarter\nWe want to involve the community as early as we can to help us shape Worship the way players want it to be, and Kickstarter is the best way to do so. We strongly believe that transparency is key to your involvement so we will be upfront with the community. This Kickstarter campaign isn't meant to fully fund the production of Worship, but will be essential to start building a community, to see if players are as excited about the game as we are and also to help the financial viability of the project. More often than not, Kickstarter funds fall short of the kind of production value we aim for with Worship. Rest assured that the amount asked does not reflect the intended quality for the final product. We are assuming part of the risk ourselves and have already secured most of the funding for fulfilling our vision of the game. Kickstarter will enable us to unleash the full potential of Worship and make it the game our players want.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTransparency is one of our top priorities, so it's important that our backers are aware of the challenges and potential risks of the project. Kickstarters do not always result in positive outcomes, especially in an industry as complex as ours. We want to reassure you that we have the resources and experience to deliver Worship as promised. However, the success of the Kickstarter campaign will confirm the community\u2019s excitement for the game, allowing us to put all of our focus on Worship. \n\nWe also want you to know that if you jump in early and back the campaign, some things and design aspects of the game might change during the iteration process. This doesn\u2019t mean that the core vision of the game will change, but that some elements of the final product may differ from what we presented in the early stages of development if we realize that the game would benefit from some design adjustments.\n\nThat being said, Worship isn\u2019t our first rodeo, as we previously shipped a game, including a console port on Switch. We were thrilled with how players received our wacky coop adventure game Struggling, with a 95% of positive user reviews on Steam. We are confident in our ability to deliver the project you are backing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Curious Wanderer", "descp": "Any support is appreciated!

Currently, there are no agreements and therefore we cannot guarantee that it will reach the shelves of your region. To reward the commitment of the backers who support the project and who will help bring it to life, we have provided a series of extras to make the game deluxe, such as s wonderful playmat, tokens and new meeples and other extra features.\nTo thank you for your help and support we have included in the core game box 2 Kickstarter EXCLUSIVE expansions: \"Black Market\" and \"Don't Gamble with Strangers\".\nThose will be revealed step by step through daily updates.\nStretch Goals have been already designed, they have been already tested and ready to be produced. With this approach, we fully expect to deliver Chamber of Wonders by October 2021.  \nTo reach a wider audience of potential supporters, we have created some Social Stretch Goals and some Milestones, linked to the achievement of non-economically based objectives.\nMr. Holmes is here!

With your help, Sherlock Holmes defeated the evil Professor and ensured him to justice.\n\"Sherlock - A Chamber in Red\" expansion is now FREE for all those who supported this fantastic Kickstarter Campaign!  \nThank you for your great support, all your actions helped us to let people know about Chamber of Wonders!\n\nPlease Note: \"Sherlock - A Chamber in Red\" expansion is free only for backers that supported us with any pledge with reward during the Kickstarter Campaign. \nThis game demonstrates the dedication that our artistic team pours out in creating stunning visual systems for our games. Every single design, illustration and graphic composition is studied in detail to give you a unique experience, to immerse yourself in the game atmosphere.\nAll illustrations and arts have been designed by Giovanni Pirrotta, a veteran in some of our major projects (Black Rose Wars, Nova Aetas Renaissance, Sine Tempore).\nThe wonderful Introduction Video has been created and developed by Fulvio Pisani (storyboardgame), Fulvio has been great in capturing the essence and the atmosphere of Chamber of Wonders.\nThanks to your support we will be able to improve the game with further artistic features related to new materials, such as new Wonder Cards. \nLudus Magnus Studio is a company based in Riverside, CA -US, and a sister company in Europe, based in Rome, Italy. Since our start, LMS has created several games, all very ground-breaking, such as Sine Tempore, Black Rose Wars, and more recently Nova Aetas Renaissance. We have been fortunate to attract many famous designers and many fans of boardgaming sector, who have sent us their feedback and who continually help us to renew our enthusiasm for this fantastic hobby of ours.\nLudus Magnus Lite is a new department within Ludus Magnus Studio, created in 2020, with a specific objective: develop small, smart, fun and affordable games.\nWithin this objective, we aim to produce all new games keeping the same standards that we set for our major brand. We want awesome and fun mechanics, stunning artworks, top quality for components. Chamber of Wonders is the second game from Ludus Magnus Lite, following in the footsteps of Sherwood Bandits. \n Stefano Castelli and Diego Cerreti designed several board games in the last few years. \nTheir games have great success and they are providing a lot of fun to many people. Stefano is one of the game designers of Potion Explosion, while Diego has created games like GodZ.\nWe believe Chamber of Wonders is their little precious masterpiece.\nChamber of Wonders is ready to be produced, it has been tested for several years.\nAll additional materials are already prepared as well, they just need your support to bring them to life.\nBecause of this, just minor adjustments will be needed after the Kickstarter campaign, we plan to deliver Chambers of Wonders next October 2021. Please note, however, that if a new wave of COVID hits the Chinese factories or the shipping industry this summer, this delivery estimate may be affected beyond our control.\nThanks to our prior experience in game production we can establish where there may be delays in delivery. Any KS project where the number and type of Stretch Goals and add-ons is uncertain implies a subsequent development and playtest phase and can usually lengthen the time for shipments, from a few months to a couple of years. This project has a defined number of SGs and add-ons so it will not be affected by those type of delays; in 8 months we fully plan to deliver the KS copy with all the exclusives to you.\nConsidering this short-term delivery time and the controlled number of SG components, there will be no problem with increases in shipping costs. Only add-ons or additional copies of the game can influence your final shipping cost.\nThis list contains shipping costs for a Collector's edition pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager according to your address, and that costs will change based on optional buys you will choose.\n\nVAT and Custom fees are included in the pledge amount.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChamber of Wonders is our second project as Ludus Magnus Lite, the eighth game as Ludus Magnus Studio. Our factory is at full capacity for this project and our shipping partners are optimistic that for this project delivery there will be no insurmountable issues with respect to Covid-19. We planned Chamber of Wonders to be delivered by October. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated about any unforeseen issues that may arise. As you can see from our pictures, the design is complete and the files are already in the factory's hands. We just need to raise the funds, verify the final Stretch Goals, and say \"go!\".\n\nOur History so far:\n\nNova Aetas (delivered): \"Our first project, we poured our hearts into this game.

This is our fourth mug from this manufacturer.\nTHE SHIRT\nIt's a grey ring-spun cotton garment by Next Level Apparel; it's soft to the touch and hand-printed in our Arizona studio on the right chest. 4XL and 5XL will be printed on a different garment (Gildan) as they aren't made in those sizes.\nLARGER SHIRTS (2XL+)\nFor every t-shirt larger than XL please add extra funds to accommodate the larger size:\n                             2XL + $2 USD\n                             3XL + $3 USD\n                             4XL + $4 USD\n                             5XL + $5 USD\nBLACK SHIRT OPTION\nIf you'd rather have a black t-shirt, you can do that, too.

It also has an iron-on backing. We do a lot of patches, and this one is 100% embroidery like the others we've made.\nTHE STICKER \nStickers are fun, and a lot of our Monster Rangers (our community of awesome folks) like to put them on their Hydroflasks, notebooks, and cars. This one is made out of vinyl, and measures 3 inches across.\nGENTALMAN JIHM \nThis is the Fiji Mermaid crypto-specimen that we've been \"reconditioning* for the month. \nLike the many carnivals he's been in, Gentalman Jihm is the star of our show.

Is he some sort of Frog Pope?\" and of course it stuck. TED Talk Toad was a close contender, but I'm not sure anyone wants to listen to a TED Talk about bugs and all things squelchy... \nFrog Pope started out as a miniature for tabletop gaming. For this campaign, I'm offering special pricing on the the digital files, 3D prints, and an exclusive opportunity! All physical miniatures are printed with exceptional detail in premium grey resin. \nI'll be using a Pledge Manager so you can nab one of the 100 limited edition pins and the Frog Pope miniatures! Take advantage of the KS campaign discount price and save on shipping at the same time! Don't see your country listed for shipping? Just send a message so I can calculate it and have it added!\nMake 100 is Kickstarter's annual feature for artists to create 100 of something to get the year started off right! This campaign will fund the production of a limited run of 100 pins with an exclusive color palette. Any unsold pins will be available on Etsy until stock runs out, but when this batch of 100 are gone I won't be producing the color palette again.\n\n\nThe original stretch goals are unlocked, plus a few bonuses! Backer cards are pin-only rewards, but stickers will go out to all backers who will receive physical items. Stickers will also be available in the pledge manager.  The Epic Frog Pope is currently under development and I'll be able to share more details about his final size soon. \nThe Limited edition Make100 pins are all gone and I'd been considering doing an open edition pin for my shop in the future... here he is a bit early! Only Open Edition Pins will be available in the pledge manager, limited edition pins will not.  If you want to upgrade from the Make100 tier and get both pins, you need to adjust your pledge (+$11 for the second pin) or use the pledge manager to add the pin, don't switch tiers or you will miss out on the limited pin. \n\nPerfect for tabletop gaming or just collecting and admiring, Frog Pope comes in several sizes, including the option to buy the digital files to print yourself or a one-of-a-kind hand painted 85mm tall figurine. \nThese rewards do not come with a pin, unless noted otherwise. You'll need to pledge the Limited Edition Pin tier and add the extras as add-ons. More on that next. \nWant the Limited Edition Pin and some miniatures for your table? You can use the pledge manager after the campaign to add the miniatures or digital files. The pledge manager will only charge you the difference in cost. NOTE: the 85mm size may add some shipping delay due to a longer production time than the other minis. \nI strive to be as accurate with cost estimates as possible, and this includes shipping! I make use of recycled materials when possible, especially for padding/filler.\nAt launch I will only have shipping enabled for certain countries that I have already sent items to. If you don't see your country available don't worry! Just shoot me a message and I'll get it added. If you take advantage of the Pledge Manager to purchase any add-ons, the shipping rate might get adjusted to cover the costs of packaging material and extra shipping fees. \nThe art is done, the quotes have been solicited and the manufacturers selected; now we just need to wait for the campaign to run its course and see what stretch goals unlock! Once the campaign is over I'll be giving updates on the process but I plan to have everything wrapped up by the end of March. \n\nEarly February the campaign ends and Kickstarter takes 2 weeks to process payments\nMiddle February the funds are deposited and the order(s) are placed with the manufacturer(s).  I start printing the miniatures. \nEarly-Middle March the inventory from the manufacturers should be delivered to me\nMiddle-End March orders get sorted, quality checked, packed up and shipped to you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second campaign and I\u2019ve learned a lot from my first! \n\nPackaging & Quality Assurance__the biggest hurdle I faced with my first Kickstarter was being a one-person operation when the project got around to getting packed up to ship. This time around, the campaign rewards are much less complex, I\u2019ve developed a better system based on that first campaign and I\u2019ve enlisted some assistants to do a final Quality Check with me. \n\nShipping__ has been affected in many areas by the pandemic. There may be delays in shipping both from vendors to me, and from me to backers. Shipping costs are calculated at first class mail package rates, and domestic (US) parcels will have tracking numbers. I\u2019ll be requesting email addresses from backers to provide those tracking numbers. Please be patient if delivery is slower than expected. \n\nOutsource Manufacturing __ I have a long background in manufacturing and experience in negotiating with vendors, but enamel pins are a new industry for me so there may be setbacks such as production delays, damaged products, or needs to revise artwork to meet vendor standards. I will be making every effort to ensure a smooth experience for backers and posting updates if the project experiences delays that would affect fulfillment estimates. \n\nIn-House Manufacturing__ Due to the nature of the 3D printing material used, models should be protected with paint or a uv blocking clear coat for best longevity. If my printer goes down, there may be a delay so it can be serviced or replaced. I have backup parts for the most common consumables but otherwise most parts come from China, so can take a while, though the printer has proven reliable thus far.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Sticker", "descp": "Only want stickers?

We're Misen.\nWe design and make premium kitchen tools at fair prices. To preorder our Carbon Steel Pan and make it a reality, click Back This Project. Or read on!\nMisen Carbon Steel combines the best features of nonstick, stainless steel, and cast iron cookware into a single pan.\nUnknown to many home cooks, carbon steel is a staple in professional kitchens for good reason. Misen Carbon Steel is lighter and easier to use than cast iron, has a naturally nonstick surface, and will last forever.\nQuite simply, it makes cooking better, easier and more fun!\n\nNonstick performance, without the chemicals.\nAs a result of its natural composition, Misen Carbon Steel is able to be \"seasoned.\" 'Seasoning' refers to a structure of successive, thin layers of polymerized oil that create a durable, naturally nonstick coating. \nEven better? A pan's seasoning can easily be replenished if it wears down, for a lifetime of natural nonstick use. When you don\u2019t have to worry about delicate foods (like eggs or seafood) getting stuck to your pan, cooking gets a lot more fun! \nMisen Carbon Steel is easy to season and gets better the more you use it\nNew Pan (left), 2 - 3 Seasonings (middle), 5+ Seasonings (right)\n\nMmm Cheesy...\nThe benefits of Cast Iron, without the extra weight.\nWe have a fond place in our hearts for Cast Iron, but it\u2019s a hard pan to cook with for many people because of how heavy it is.\nWhile Cast Iron and Carbon Steel pans have similar compositions, Carbon Steel actually contains 1 - 2% less carbon. This seemingly 'small' difference is actually quite substantial, and gives Carbon Steel pans a stronger, more uniform grain structure.\nMisen Carbon Steel provides the same benefits as Cast Iron, but is thinner and lighter, making it much easier to pick up, move, and really cook with.\nYou name it, Misen Carbon Steel can cook it.\nCookware is often about tradeoffs. If you want something (say, nonstick performance), you usually have to give up something else (high heat searing). Fortunately, these rules don\u2019t apply to Carbon Steel.\nMisen Carbon Steel\u2019s natural nonstick surface, high heat tolerance, and durability makes it perfect for almost any dish. Pizza, omelets, steak, seafood, veggies \u2014 you name it, this pan can cook it to perfection.\nMisen Carbon Steel can do the job of three other pans\nLove Cooking but Hate Cleaning? Us too.\nIf you couldn't already tell, we LOVE cooking. Cleaning? Not so much. After a lot of cooking, easy clean-up is something we greatly appreciate. \nMisen Carbon Steel's naturally seasoned nonstick surface makes it incredibly easy to clean. Most of the time a little water and a towel will do the trick!  \nMisen Carbon Steel is built to last a lifetime\nOur Carbon Steel Pan is made from 99% Iron and 1% Carbon, a composition that is stronger than Cast Iron and durable enough to last a lifetime. So your Misen Carbon Steel won\u2019t just be your favorite pan, but one that future generations can enjoy too! \n\n\n\nThe millimeters matter.\nMany things have changed at Misen since we launched in 2015. One thing that hasn\u2019t? Our (loving) obsession with creating the best kitchen tools possible. From initial sketches, to 3D prints, to final production samples, creating Misen Carbon Steel was as thorough as it was fun.      \n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $500M raised in total.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is risk-free, and with the vast majority of projects, the biggest risk is timing.\n\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter Campaign, and with each one we have done, we have been further along in the development and production process to make the experience smoother for our amazing backers (you!). \n\nWe feel great about getting our products to you on time - but unforeseen events can and do pop up.

My name is Jimmy Mole.\nI am a 3D Art guy & Designer. I have worked in the computer games, film & VR industry for over 5 years now and worked on Mobile, PC, PS4, Xbox games, Animated films & VR projects such as The Peterson Case, Nyjah Huston: #Skatelife, Kings of Soccer, Quest of Legends, Word Demon, Bakkar, Trollbridge, Metro6 & Ayer.\nI have released three games of my own on the App Store and GooglePlay Store and I am hoping to release three more this year. Over the last 10 years I have been involved with computers and design in some shape or form - either studying, working in the industry or freelance work. I love making and designing games and creating animations and models for them which is why I would love to make The Crucible Collection become a reality. The project will involve things such as planning, modelling, sculpting, rigging & 3D printing for the main part which is exactly what my previous roles have involved.\n\nPlan\nThe end goal is to create 50 Miniature Sculptures to celebrate the magic of the World Snooker Championship which is held in Sheffield every year during April & May. Fans of snooker will recall many magical moments from this Sporting Event such as:\nAlex Higgins holding his baby girl and the Trophy \nDennis Taylor pumping his cue in the air\nCliff Thorburn nailing the first 147\nSteve Davis winning his 6th World Title \nRonnie O' Sullivan's triumph in 2013 after taking a year out\nStephen Hendry winning a record breaking 7th World Title\nStuart Bingham's victory in 2015\nJimmy White's 147 in 1992 against Tony Drago\nKen Doherty winning the title in 1997\nMark Williams producing some amazing snooker to lift the title in 2018 at 43 years old\n\nBall-Run Basking in 2015:\nThe Nuggett Nails his 6th World Title in 1989:\nAn Emotional Hurricane Higgins wins the Coveted World Snooker Trophy in 1982:\n\nThere are far too many great moments to list and that is why we need \"The Crucible Collection\". It will mainly feature legends from the iconic venue - but anyone who has won just one match at The Crucible is a candidate for being sculpted in 3D and turned into a miniature - take Rory McLeod for example when he beat Judd Trump in 2017, or Robert Milkins who beat Neil Robertson in 2013, these players are not part of the collection but may appear as a Mystery Miniature. There are many other great players too such as Ricky Walden, Ian McCulloch, Andy Hicks, Doug Mountjoy, Fred Davis and Stephen Lee who could appear as a Mystery Miniature.\nMiniatures will be 1:16 scale:\nSteve Davis is 6' 1.5\" so his height will be 11.7cm \nStuart Bingham is 5' 9\" so his height will be 10.95cm\nAlex Higgins is 5' 8.5\" so his height will be 10.9cm\nThis project idea came to me in 2016. I was enjoying Xmas at home with my family and, being a fan of snooker I was looking for a way of combining this into my job somehow. I decided right then to make some rough plans and notes  - I then proceeded to start getting those ideas and sketches on my computer, over the course of the next 2 years and 4 months I have spent around 500 hours on the 3 miniatures on my days off, weekends, holidays and evenings etc. The last month I have worked on this project full time and tirelessly to get it over the line and present it to people who will hopefully connect with it and pledge towards the campaign.\nI have been to The Crucible in Sheffield many times to watch the snooker and I fell in love with the game when, as a  9 year old I remember watching Dennis Taylor v Steve Davis in 1985 - my parents let me stay up late and it was a truly magical and memorable match which has stayed with me all my life. Throughout the years I have continued to follow snooker and I think the sport has produced many great characters such as Alex Higgins, Ronnie O' Sullivan, Ray Reardon, Fred Davis and Mark Williams to name a few. \nI feel so passionate about making this project work. I love the idea of creating the rest of these characters so people can collect them, celebrate them and paint them etc. Snooker isn't given much of a look in by the news and sports channels nowadays and I think it would be good to get it back on the map and pay homage to the skill it takes to play the game.\nl plan on creating the Miniatures over a 4 year period. I appreciate its a long time but I work alone, and I also think it will get people excited to know that every 3 months there will be 3 new players to add to their collections. The Crucible Theatre has hosted the World Snooker Championship since 1977, in 2023 when the collection end there will be 50 iconic figures. There could possibly also be a second collection of figures depending on the success of this campaign to feature many other past, present and future stars!\nNB. Players who won the title but appear in a different pose such as Dennis holding his cue aloft or Cliff sinking to his knees after his 147 will also be supplied with the World Snooker Trophy.\nThe plan is to work full time 40+ hours per week on this project over the next 4 years to see it through the completion. \nThis project is my life, literally. I've been studying for many years and working hard in computers and this is what I want more than anything, I'd love to create these figures to celebrate this great sport of snooker. The truth is too, I really need to make this project happen as my job in Games/VR finished last month so all my focus is now truly on this Kickstarter project and creating these rewards for my backers. \nThe goal is to get the first 3 players shipped out in October 2019, which gives me time, depending on how many people support the campaign, to create more resin copies and casts and also get all the packaging finalised plus tweak the current 3 players to make them better - packaging is something that hasn't really been given any major thought yet due to the lack of time, most time needs to be spent modelling and sculpting. \nA Mock-up for packaging:\n\nCosts\nA breakdown of costs is given below:\n\u00a390,000 Development and Creation Costs\n\u00a325,000 3D Print and Model making costs for the rewards (print resin, cast resin, silicone molds, clean up, packaging and postage costs etc)\n\u00a315,000 Kickstarter fee \n\u00a315,000 New Computer equipment and 3D Printer for prototyping and test prints etc\n\u00a32,500 Promotional material and marketing\n\u00a32,500 Software yearly fees and updates\nRewards\nPlease Note: \nRewards will be shipped out in January, April, July & October. Backers who have pledged \u00a32500 for example will receive all their Miniatures throughout the timeline of the project between October 2019 through till October 2023. Likewise for backers who pledge a lesser amount ie. If you pledge \u00a3200 you will receive a Keyring and 3 Miniatures in October 2019 and 3 Miniatures in January 2020.\n\nSteve in Milk Chocolate:\nThe Crucible Collection Poster:\nNB. Rewards may differ slightly from the above images.\n\nList of Players\nPlease see the rewards list for a full breakdown of the players. There will be 45 players set in stone and a further 5 mystery players to get people excited.\nHere is the full sculpting list:\nAlex Higgins\nSteve Davis\nStuart Bingham\nRonnie O' Sullivan\nMark Williams\nJimmy White\nStephen Hendry\nDennis Taylor\nDing Junhui\nCliff Thorburn\nJohn Parrott\nMystery Miniature 1/5\nKen Doherty\nJoe Johnson\nTerry Griffiths\nRay Reardon\nNeil Robertson\nMystery Miniature 2/5\nMark Selby\nJudd Trump\nJohn Virgo\nMarco Fu\nPeter Ebdon\nJohn Higgins\nBarry Hawkins\nWillie Thorne\nPaul Hunter\nAlan McManus\nGraeme Dott\nKirk Stevens\nAli Carter\nStephen Maguire\nTony Knowles\nJames Wattana\nShaun Murphy\nMatthew Stevens\nJoe Perry\nNeal Foulds\nTony Drago\nMystery Miniature 3/5\nMark Allen\nJohn Spencer\nDominic Dale\nKyren Wilson\nNigel Bond\nAnthony Hamilton\nBill Werbeniuk\nJoe Swail\nMystery Miniature 4/5\nMystery Miniature 5/5\n\nWho are Mystery Miniatures? Sounds Exciting!\nI guess the simple answer is its a surprise! These 5 Miniatures are reserved for retired players, present players, up and coming players & new players. The list below will give snooker fans an idea of who may appear on the Mystery Miniature list:\nRory McLeod\nFred Davis\nRobert Milkins\nMichael Holt\nMark King\nDavid Gilbert\nMartin Gould\nTony Meo\nFergal O' Brien\nMike Hallett\nLuca Brecel\nIan McCulloch\nRyan Day\nRickey Walden\nDechawat Poomjaeng\nElliott Slessor\nMitchell Mann\nDavid Grace\nYan Bingtao\nReanne Evans\n\nCurrent Players from The Crucible Collection\nCurrent Miniatures who will be part of The Crucible Collection. Steve Davis is 11.7cm and one of the tallest players. Players will range between 10.5cm - 12cm in height. Bear in mind this is not the overall height of the actual miniature as Stuart for example is holding aloft the coveted World Snooker Championship Trophy which makes him around 13cm in total height. \n\n\nWorkflow and the Miniature Creation Process\nI do not use any kind of scanning techniques or motion capture etc for this kind of work. It is all hand sculpted in Zbrush using a PC and Wacom tablet:\nIf anyone is interested in knowing how these sculpts are created this section explains some of the process. I guess the start of any project kicks off with some planning. I like to go quite in depth on this with the following:\nNotes \nSketches\nThumbnails\nReference\nI think anything that helps get you to a finished project is worth putting into the planning stages. Below are some further details on this - some of the typical things i do when planning and throughout the design and sculpting process. My drawing leaves a lot to be desired but as long as it helps me get to my end goal that is my main concern in planning, i'm not looking to create a masterpiece, just some sketches and notes etc to make it clear in my mind what is required in 3D. I guess you can liken them to the Rob Walker notes he makes - they aid in the final delivery. I also like to shoot some reference and get into character and its super helpful when posing your character after rigging. I learnt this from animating and various courses such as Animation Mentor - create some notes, thumbnails and reference - it really is worth it to see the forms, shapes, structure and rhythms in the body. I even made a fake World Snooker Trophy out of cardboard!\nI also find it helpful to do some simple Ecorche type draw overs to pick out some of the landmarks so they are clear to me, and make a few notes of facial features and muscles etc:\nEye Reference:\nVarious Notes, Sketches & Scribbles:\n\nSome of the many references found by trawling the internet for images and footage of Higgins, Davis & Bingham:\nBelow are some of my other planning sketches, scribbles and notes which were created on the iPad, again, they are just rough plans to get an idea of what needs to be created in 3D, not looking to create a piece of art, just some foundations. Some of them are future Miniature sculpts which will be created if this project is successful. I have included them to show that I have a broad knowledge of the World Snooker Championship and it gives people a taster of some future miniatures they could see if the project is successful. Maybe some of you Snooker fans out there can remember some of these matches:\nSome typical Sketchbook images. I am always doodling around with shapes and scribbles which helps with 3D Sculpting:\n Below are some WIP images to show the evolution of a sculpt:\nMy sons leg came in useful as reference when I was sculpting Lauren's legs here!\nIf you look at all the characters I have aimed for a more subtle kind of flow, gesture and Line of Action as opposed to a pushed animation gesture:\nAs you can see from the previous images the various items of clothing, hand and face start off low-poly (face not as low to capture more details) and works up into the details - usually primary, secondary and tertiary forms. Following on from the planning process I will begin to block in shapes, forms and rhythms of the head looking out for key landmarks such as the Zygomatic arch, temporal line, nose wings, cheek fat, eye shapes and the profile view - the portrait of the character is by far the hardest part. I guess its just a case of sticking with it and doing the best you can to try and capture a likeness in the expression and of the character while following notes and constantly referring reference (A huge and never ending learning curve). It is iteration after iteration and sticking with it however muddy it gets is the key for me, anyone who works in 3D and Games will tell you that it is an uphill battle most of the time - and they are right, its a labour of love. \nTo progress from planning to finish takes a lot of hard work and constant checking of references, proportions, anatomy, structure, gesture and silhouette etc - something that is basically a lifetimes work (as Michelangelo said at 87.... \"I am still learning....\"). So am I, and my goal is to keep trying to improve over time.\nThe body, like the face with the nose, eyes, jaw and brows etc can be broken down into the torso, legs, hands, feet etc. The main aim again is to use your notes and reference and try to capture the player and the body type. When I pose my character I will try and get a subtle rhythm and gesture to them from all angles.\nSome of the key tools I use in ZBrush include Move Topological, Clay BuildUp, Dam Standard, Masking, Dynamesh and the Light Tool:\nBelow is an early WIP of Ding winning his semi-final against Alan McManus in 2016 and Ronnie winning the title in 2013. My initial plan was to create 5 characters for the Kickstarter but I decided it would take too long so decided on 3, but these 2 WIP's will certainly be used later down the line if the campaign is a success. Notice I am blocking in the primary and secondary forms of the face here with a focus on expression and structure. There are many hours left on these 2 guys but hopefully you can see a little resemblance to Ronnie O' Sullivan & Ding Junhui (2 of my favourite players by the way).\nAdding more Form to Ding Junhui's Nose wings and Upper Eyes:\nPLAY\n\nI also use the following books to help with Anatomy, posing and sculpting etc:\nAtlas of Human Anatomy by Stephen Rogers Peck\nHuman Anatomy for the Artist by Eliot Goldfinger\nComplete guide to Facial Expression for Artists by Gary Faigin\nThe Animators Survival Kit by Richard Williams (Best book ever!)\nAfter planning, modelling, sculpting and rigging the characters the next thing is to start prepping for 3D print so the characters slot together - and various other technical issues such as closing holes, dynameshing, cleaning the geometry and decimating to reduce the polycount.\nAs a guideline each character takes around 100-150 hours from planning to coming out of casting. After casting there is still clean up work required before they are 100% ready to be shipped out to people.\nBelow are some images to show the process of keying a character. Alex Higgins was quite complex due to him holding the baby:\nFollowing the keying and print prep process the goal is to actually start printing the models, supports need to be prepared in the 3D print software, below is an image of some of the model parts in Preform for Formlabs 2:\nAs long as print prep is done properly the result will be good but you will inevitably get some print failures due to support breaks, orientation and other wall thickness. Supports are quite annoying to remove though and can really hinder the final result. Some print tests from an Objet and Formlabs are below:\nObjet did not seem to pick up enough details. Formlabs are great printers, but the supports can be a pain. My final decision was to go with a secret 3D printer of which i cant giveaway the details, but it has been modified, enhanced and tweaked to give great results.\nThe results from \"The Beast\" were pretty awesome in my opinion:\nSprue Casting of some Heads and Hands etc:\n\"The Beast\" still required some clean up and support removal, but it was a lot less supports to remove than the Formlabs, there was a little breakage on Binghams' ear but this was corrected post print via putty and filler clean up.\nFollowing the 3D printing the next goals are silicone moulding and creating resin copies of the characters followed by clean up. The prints need some mold line removal and clean up, but for hobbyists this forms part of the enjoyable process before painting. They can also be left as they are and will still look good.\nMold line removal and clean up:\n\nPost 3D Print / Resin Copies\nVarious painting tests on the characters using Acrylic paints - They are WIP to show that the Miniatures will look good whichever route you choose. You can leave them in the grey cast resin, spray them in gold, bronze or another colour of your choice or paint them realistically (Be aware the eyes are tough going!).\nPlease note:\nMiniatures will require a little clean up to remove any mould lines and casting artefacts. They will also be supplied unpainted and require a little filler in places. None of this modelling process is difficult or time consuming.\n\n\nThe techniques used to final the painting of Bingham include the use of a Wet Pallette, colour mixing, washing, layering and hair drying. I will post more character painting in future updates to the project. I sprayed the other coloured characters with Montana Gold spray paint.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nCurrent Miniatures of The Crucible Collection\nThe bulk of the 3D prints are good to go but they are still prototypes - they are 90% there but not final. The idea of the Kickstarter timeline being so long is mainly concerned with the amount of time it actually takes to sculpt and create the characters from planning through to casting and post print. But there are still niggling problems with the current characters which will need further work and attention before mass production and these include:\nWall thickness in places is thin and needs to be filled, such as the ear on Stuart, the collar on Steve and the Cheque Alex is Holding. \nThe tassels on Stuarts trophy need reworking due to print and casting errors. They are too thin and a new design is required to \"hook\" them onto the trophy. After assembling these it was noted that they are far too thin and awkward to put together correctly. \nThe Lady statue is far too fragile. It has broke several times and needs scaling and reworking.\nThe hands gripping Stuart and Steve's trophy have caused a few casting problems with the resin getting caught and clogged. \nSome of the keying points need to be scaled slightly for a snugger fit. \nTrophy is quite thin between the base and main cup shape so will need scaling to make more sturdy.\nThere are also some niggling errors such as proportions and structure namely on Steve with his Torso length and leg length as well as the Trophy which needs to be rectified. The models could be shipped out but I am a perfectionist and they need to 100% correct, no questions asked.\n\nFurther Project Images\nPLAY\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter and Crowd Funding?\nI have had a lot of interest in these Miniatures and people are very excited about them. I have had shops wanting to stock them and an offer from the CEO of a massive snooker company to go into partnership, which is fantastic. The truth is though I feel that by doing it this way it gives me more time and less pressure (I hope!) and I can make sure the Miniatures are 100% before being shipped to backers. The community around Kickstarter is fantastic and people really get excited about receiving their products fresh off the production line - or in this case - casting line! I hope that this route gives me an opportunity to keep hold of my baby and reward my backers with some FANTASTIC merchandise and collectables.\n\nFurther Info\nMy initial plan was to create colour sculpts for people to collect. I was hoping to texture the characters in Mari but the costs are immense - the average cost of a colour print is well over \u00a3300 so it simply wasn't possible. Colour 3D prints do not seem to retain as much detail either as non-colour DLP/SLA prints but this is something that is a possible future goal if colour printing costs come down and the technology improves. The image below shows the use of Mari to project skin but its hard to find high-res images and also the lighting information has to be removed from the image which hasn't been done here.\nAnother thing currently not possible is to capture every little detail from the sculpt. Even though the characters were printed at DLP Resin down to +/-13um XY accuracy and 15um Z layers it certainly didn't capture everything, but being 1:16 scale it would be hard to see wrinkles with the naked eye.\nSome of the details here are hard to capture at 100% on a 3D printer:\nStuart's hair, eyebrows, wrinkles, stubble and skin pores are not captured. I guess the lesson to be learnt is that in the future pores and tertiary details cant be left out for 3D printing.\nThings like the trophy text, the detail of The Lady trophy topper and finger folds etc are too small to capture on a 1:16 scale miniature. A solution for text is to use transfers which I am currently making for Stuart Bingham's sponsor of Betfred and Swiss Watches Direct. I will post these in future updates as well as more in-depth painting of the characters.\nWe also lose some details before printing when we decimate a mesh. Basically this means lowering the poly count for printing as most printers do not accept more than 1 million polygons - Stuart's Head was around 16 million polygons before decimation which reduced it to around 750,000 polys.\n\nIn Summary\nOnce the Miniatures are shipped out people will be able to paint them to a high standard if they wish or spray them in a single colour like the paint tests I carried out earlier in the project description - its entirety up to the individual. They will still look good in plain cast resin. I hope you can see that these Miniatures will make nice collectables for snooker fans all over the World.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\nStretch Goals\nSome of the miniatures will be supplied painted.\nPossible Full Colour prints via 3D Texturing and Printing in Colour.\nThe Crucible Collection Assembly Kit which will include items such as:\nHobby Knife\nFiles\nMould Line Remover\nBrush\nSuper Glue\nFiller\nSponges etc\n\nSoftware\nI used the following software in my workflow:\nMaya\nRoadkill\nZbrush\nPhotoshop\nKeyshot\nMari (only briefly used to show Stretch goals)\n\nThank You's\nI would like to say a massive Thank you to the following people for their support, encouragement, feedback and help during and towards the end of this project:\nJon Cave\nSam Wilson\nAdomas Biskis\nNajam Gulbaz\nEddie Fisher\nEd Blincoe\nDan Floyd\nKarl Simonsohn\nJason Francis\nWhirlwind Fan Ian\nElliot Slessor\nRebecca Kenna\nJames Otero\nDaniel Mole\nDeanne Mole\n\nThanks also to:\nPixologic\nThe Foundry\nZealot Miniatures\nFormlabs\nObjet\nCentral Scanning\nCGMA\nPullin Shapes \nSiege Studios\nWorld Seniors Snooker\nArtis Opus\nGetty Images\nGoogle\nMO Studios\nMontana Gold \nDoug Wood Band\nYouTube and the 'Fair Use' Policy \nShutterstock\n5 Alarm Music\nStudio G\nEMI Recordings\nBBC \nEurosport\nPRS Music\nAnd...........

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

DARTER is beautifully machined from aluminium and brass in our East London workshop.\nOur pen and sewing kit really is this tiny. The internal sewing kit is just \u00bc\u201d in diameter (6.3mm)\nWe have 4 options to choose from: all silver, all gold, silver with gold trim, and gold with silver trim. The silver is made from aluminium and the gold is made from brass.\nEvery part is machined from a solid rod of aluminium and brass. There are no plastic parts.\nWhy did we put a sewing kit in a pen? Our answer is: because we can.  \nOur cutting-edge \"Swiss Turn\" machinery and team can cut parts smaller and with more precision than most CNC workshops.\nAt first, our intention was to make the world's smallest refillable pen. Early on, however, we noticed that our designs had wasted space between the refill and the outer sleeve.\nAt ornisi, we pride ourselves on finding ways of utilising even the tiniest space.\nWe spent a long time designing this striking button feature on the back of our pens. Each button is machined and drilled from a solid metal bar.\nOur passion is making small, useful tools. At the design stage, every line and every detail are considered as we try and maximise functionality. Our speciality is in adding useful features into everyday miniature objects. Only when the design is complemented do we add these features, but never at the expense of beautiful simple lines. After much research, we felt that the perfect addition to the empty space in our pen would be a small selection of thread and sewing needles.\nOur machine and team work at rapid speeds. This shows a small sample of 3 days of work dialling in the machine. Everything fits perfectly.\nAt first, we thought it impossible to machine a sewing kit so small that it would fit within this space. Any additional thickness to the pen would have been a deal breaker. Finally, following an intensive month of machining and testing (and the breaking of a few of our tiniest drills), the world's smallest sewing kit was born.\nEach sewing kit can hold 4 needles and 2 small lengths of thread\nEvery part of this pen has been meticulously designed. With its 4 dummy holes, the selector knob has been made to look like a button.\nThe Design Brief\n1. The DARTER pen had to be small - really small. So small, in fact, that it could be added to your keychain and go unnoticed. It needed to be no larger than a door key.\nIt was crucial that the DARTER was not uncomfortable in your pocket, and so we set the diameter of the pen to 7.5mm and its length to 58mm.\nOur Swiss turn CNC machine with 4m bar feeder. It can be loaded with multiple lengths of material and left to run for days on end. When we go home, it keeps working.\n2. The DARTER is made in-house in our East London workshop. If a feature in the design needed to be outsourced locally or overseas, we got rid of it. For us, it was essential that every part of this pen could be made using our own machinery and our own expertise.\nAll our pens have a brass sewing kit hiding inside.\nWe learnt a lot from 3Coil, our sister company, who launched a successful Kickstarter campaign. Working with factories that have 40 years of experience means we have a wealth of expertise and capabilities to tap into. This said, since these companies are such huge businesses, they have many departments and customers. Making a change or tweaking a design can take over a month for a simple revision.\nBut waiting around was no good for this project. At Ornisi, we are just as impatient as you. We don\u2019t want to wait around. We want changes to happen in a few hours, not a few days or weeks. If we do have to make a revision, we want a shiny part in our hands by the end of the day.\nTo achieve this rapid prototyping solution, a different strategy to normal was needed. From Day 1, our creatives worked closely with our engineer. This meant that at the end of the design stage, this daily collaboration gave birth to an awesome product that not only looked and worked great, it could also be made on our machine by our engineer the very next day.\nAll the colours of Darter.\nIncredibly, our time for prototyping has reduced from one month to less than one day. Our in-house manufacturing is up to 1000 parts per day. Our machines run 24/7. \nThe DARTER pen is the perfect addition to any survival or every day carry kit\n3. It was important that our pen was refillable with a quality refill. Many pens on the market are either sealed and not refillable, or else use cheap refills that dry out quickly. A non-refillable pen is very wasteful. We wanted a pen which could both write well, and which would last a lifetime.\nTherefore, because of their quality and size, we decided to use Cross matrix ballpoint refills. All our pens ship with black ink.\nThe DARTER pen and sewing kit is always with you, so you can repair while you are out and about\n4. The DARTER pen doesn\u2019t need to carry metres of thread \u2013 just enough for emergency wardrobe malfunctions. Our kit carries the right amount needed for \u2018on the go\u2019 repairs.\nEach pen contains a single bobbin, holding 1 meter of thread\nThis said, sometimes a job may require an extra-long piece of thread for a larger emergency repair. The DARTER can also be used in this situation.\nAll our needles are No.10 Gold Eye Sharps needles \u2013 though small, they are tough and get the job done.\nWhy do we manufacture in-house?  \nWe produce beautiful turned parts in rapid time. Our expert team, from designers to our engineer and machinist, produce amazing results. Believe us when we say we can turn an idea or a sketch into a production part within 48 hours.\nIt can be frustrating for both our team and our backers to have to wait weeks, even months, for things to happen in our manufacturing partners\u2019 factories. But by making this ourselves, the momentum never diminishes. Plus, we can share this amazing journey with you \u2013 you can even see your pen being made through a webcam inside our machine. Should we need to make any changes or overcome any obstacles you can watch us fix the problem in real time.\nSpecification\nMaximum size needles 27mm x 0.75mm diameter\nLength of thread on a bobbin - 100cm (39\")\nMax length of thread on Darter Sew 2x 59cm (23\") - 118cm total\nNumber of needles in Darter Sew - 4\nCompatible Ink Refill - Cross Matrix Ballpoint Only \nInk Colour - Only Black supplied\nSilver Material - 2011 Aluminium \nGold Material - CZ121 Brass\nColours available in the Cross Matrix range - Blue, Black, Red\nWe need your support\nOur sliding head CNC machines require extremely precise material to be fed into them. This is not the usual \u2018off the shelf\u2019 lengths of aluminium or brass, but precision prepared material which is ground down to the exact same diameter along its 3-metre length. Since our machines run unattended, the slightest deviation in the diameter could jam the machine. In our test run of 100 parts, a lot of time was spent cleaning each piece from the cutting oil. The funding we raise will help us buy toleranced diameter material and an ultrasonic cleaning machine, which will speed up the assembly and shipping stage.

PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n\n\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

This includes new versions of the 4 Monsters only available in the original Kickstarter campaign, the brand-new Stag Clan (including their Mystics and Sculpted Clan Tokens), and also 24 Cards to add a 5th Player into the board game! \nThrough Stretch Goals this pledge level has been further enhanced with the addition of 3 brand new Monsters, 3 Sculpted Tokens, and 7 Golden Gods of Asgard, including the new Hel.\nWhile the Blood Rage Digital game is set to launch in December 2019, the physical promo items are expected to be delivered to backers beforehand, around August 2019.  \nFind out more about these Optional Purchases in the following links: Blood Rage Core Box, Playmat Board, Mystics of Midgard, Deluxe Gods of Asgard, Art Book, Cardboard Clan Dashboards, Sculpted Tokens, and Cardboard Age Track & Valhalla Tiles.\nBlood Rage Digital is set to faithfully recreate the amazing experience of the tabletop game inside your computer, available for both Windows and Mac OS in English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. The universe of the board game has been recreated and adapted to the digital realm, taking full advantage of this new medium.\nPlease note all screenshots of the digital game are Work In Progress.\nMidgard comes to life.\nThe game will feature stunning visuals set to enhance your viking experience. The Midgard play area is brought to life, with waves crashing against the fjords as the gargantuan World Serpent endlessly circles the blue vastness. Each region has its own climate, topography, trees and villages. And at the center of it all stands a beautiful representation of the great Yggdrasil tree!  \nEach region has its own unique look.\nSome of the game's 3D assets.\nNetwork play will allow up to 4 people to play together, choosing their clans and battling for glory. Alternatively, the single-player mode will pit your wits against cunning AI opponents, with several different personalities/strategies you can choose from to experience different challenges. You can even mix things up, with both virtual and real opponents joining the fray.\nChoose your cards and join the battle!\nThe interface is slick an intuitive, so veterans and newcomers alike will be pillaging in no time, with the aid of tutorials and easily-accessible rules references. \nA region destroyed by Ragnar\u00f6k.\nSince Blood Rage first launched on Kickstarter back in 2015, it has solidified its place in the pantheon of must-have modern board games. However, since the vast majority of Blood Rage fans didn't discover the game until well after that initial campaign was over, they never had a chance to get the exclusive promos it contained. With this campaign for the Digital version of the game, we thought it would be a great opportunity to right that wrong. While the original promos will remain exclusive to that campaign, we've created alternate versions of them exclusively for the Physical Viking Pledge, with new names, art, and sculpts, but retaining the same gameplay characteristics.\nPlease note that to play with these promos, you will require a Blood Rage core box (for sale in retail).\nThe proud Stag Clan shows that viking women are every bit as fierce as the men. This set not only adds more diversity to your games, complete with sculpted Clan Tokens and Mystic figures (requires the Mystics of Midgard expansion to use), but it also comes with 8 extra cards for each Age, so that the board game can be played with 5 players! \nThe Stag Clan comes with everything you need to add it to your board game, expanding it to 5 players:\n1 Leader Figure\n8 Warrior Figures (featuring 2 different sculpts)\n2 Mystic Figures\n1 Ship Figure\n4 Sculpted Clan Tokens\n1 Glory Marker\n13 Small Colored Bases\n2 Large Colored Bases\n1 Clan Dashboard\n1 Mystic Reference Card\n24 5-Players Cards (8 for each Age)\nThe Golden Gods of Asgard is an exclusive deluxe version of the classic expansion, where the gods occupy different provinces, affecting the basic rules of the game and creating unique dynamics to each session of the game. The deluxe version includes resculpted, oversized, golden figures for each of the original gods, as well as Hel, a brand-new God of Asgard to carry on the original game effect of Hili, a previously released exclusive promo.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive  item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nPlease Take Note!\nThe Blood Rage Digital game will be distributed via Steam, by supplying backers with an access code, so there is no shipping cost involved for the Digital Viking pledge. However, note that any Optional Purchase added to the Digital Viking pledge will be shipped from our hubs normally, so shipping costs will be charged. Regardless of what is added to the pledge (if anything) the confirmation of the pledge will still be handled via the Pledge Manager after the campaign ends.\nFor the Physical Viking pledge, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a Physical Viking Pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates of the average cost per destination and actual costs may change in the pledge manager, specially if anything is added to your pledge.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $30-$40 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $25 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$35 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $40 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n\u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n\u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n\u2022 $40 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia\n\u2022 $40 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs and import taxes. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 35th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is December 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

At the beginning of the game, Player's will choose the creatures with which they'd like to play. Players will collectively choose to have all matching hands or play \"chaotically\" where every player builds their own unique hand of creatures. Either way, a player's hand must contain a single card of each number (0-8). With the addition of a new mortal card, the Expansion also invites you to customize your game play experience with a unique mortal deck every time you play the game. Every round, or Night, you'll also play to win location cards that give you added bonuses in future Nights.\n  WELCOME! Thanks for taking the time to check out our project. If you're looking to back Campy Creatures for the first time, the options above might be great choices for you. Campy Creatures 2nd Edition gives you everything you need to play the game for the first time. The Spooky Edition next to it is our Kickstarter Exclusive product. It's got a limited edition box and a limited edition pin, and it also includes everything you need to play the game for the first time, plus the creepy new monsters we're showing off in this campaign!\nYou've asked for more re-playability, so we've refined how the Mortal Deck gets built allowing for new deck variants, added an additional Mortal card, The Assistant, and added the Location mechanic. We also improved the game layout and redesigned the rulebook.  It will also feature a larger Clash-O-Meter, providing room for both the Clash Tokens and Location cards, all in a bigger box that will fit both the base game and future expansions.\n  We're providing every backer of The Expansion tier with a Conversion Kit that includes all the new and updated Mortals Cards, the new Location Cards, and the2nd Edition rulebook. This kit updates all the card components of a 1st Edition game to the design standards of 2nd Edition.\nAlternatively, if you want all of the new components in addition to the updated cards and rulebook, you can back at the Conversion Edition tier. The Conversion Edition includes Expansion I and the Conversion Box. The Conversion Box includes all of the new and updated 2nd Edition cars as well as the new box, updated Clash-O-Meter, Clash Markers, Monster Tokens, and rulebook.\nHere is a comparison of the Conversion Kit and the Conversion Box. \nNote, Conversion Kits and Conversion Editions will be available for purchase in BackerKit after the campaign, but we will not be selling Conversion Boxes individually. In the video below, Mattox talks through some key points to keep in mind with these kits and more!\nWith the addition of Expansion I creatures, players will get to choose between 2 creature options for Creature cards 2-6, just like players get to pick between the Demogorgon and Invisible Man today. A player's hand must contain 9 creatures, one of every number from 0 to 8. Standard setup involves players having identical hands of cards, but players can also decide to play \"chaotically\" where each player chooses their hand of Creature cards at the beginning of the game. Feeling extra mad (in a science-y way of course)? Choose different Creature hands every round!\nAlong with the original Mortal sets of Teenagers, Classics and Enginneers, two new Mortal sets are being added.\n2nd Edition contains The Assistant, a Mortal that, once captured, chooses to join your ghoulish team. Assistants persist across rounds earning an increasing number of points based the quantity you've captured. These points are collected at the end of every round!\nExpansion I contains The Angry Mob. These Mortals are always on the move! Capturing an Angry Mob will cause neighboring (players to the left or right) Angry Mobs to join your collection. Capture The Instigator and ALL Angry Mobs will move to you. Lots of negative points, but a great way to secure Location victory.\nLocations are new to both 2nd Edition and Expansion I. One location is revealed every round, which is won by the player who captures the most Mortals containing the relevant \"location icons.\" The winning player gains that location's reward. 2nd Edition includes 6 new Locations and Expansion I adds 3 more. \nStretch Goal Locations\nWe did it! Josh has been at Blizzcon (I'm not jealous, you're jealous), so he is still finalizing the illustrations. They likely won't be done by the end of the campaign, so if you are joining us late, hop over to one of our social media pages for finalized art/mechanics. Speaking of mechanics, Mattox has been testing ideas for these cards, so look for those reveals as well! \nWe hadn't planned on adding any cards via stretch goals, but felt like it was another area the community wanted and we could make happen. So thanks again for your patience and for sharing your feedback!\nMattox Shuler, designer of Campy Creatures\n2nd Edition is not only a reprinting of Campy Creatures, it is an opportunity to pull our community into the development process. When we thought about changing up the base game content, we looked directly at community and player feedback about their experiences. A couple of key features stood out to us as must haves in this new edition. First, we wanted each round to have a different feel and flavor\u2014culminating in the Final Act. This comes in the form of a new Mortal type (Assistants) that are kept round to round and Locations cards that change up each round. Second, the size of the board has increased to make scoring and maneuvering around the Clash-O-Meter a little easier. Lastly, because we want to make more things in the Campy-verse, we re-arranged the Mortal deck in a new way to make the game more expandable and give players more control over how it's setup. Thank you for all of your feedback and support!\nMario Radmilovic, co-designer of Campy Creatures Expansion I\nMy name is Mario and I am one of the designers for this expansion after being a playtester and somewhat of an idea man during the first Campy Creatures Kickstarter campaign back in early 2017. Working on this expansion and actually filling the role of a designer has been a completely new experience for me, but I'm really excited about where we arrived and can't wait for you to try it.\n *Note, only the Wooden Power Up/Venom tokens and three New Locations will be included in the Expansion ($13) tier.\nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want. This extra money will appear as a credit in Backerkit. You do NOT have to do this! Once the campaign is over, you will be sent a link to finalize your order. All the things will be there.\nAll shipping charges will be handled after the campaign via BackerKit. Although we haven\u2019t finalized the specifics, we do have estimates for pledge items (i.e. before add-ons) based on prior campaign data and fulfillment partner estimates. We are close to finalizing add-on shipping and will be providing a table in an update after the campaign, but we are looking at tiering by number of add-ons items and setting a flat rate for any number of Giclee prints. So the \"each additional game\" line above is slightly over estimating the cost of extra games/apparel/cards if you add multiple items, but it is slightly underestimating the cost of adding prints.\nShipping will be Customs Friendly (US, CA, UK, EU, AU, NZ)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are continuing our manufacturing partnership with Panda Game Manufacturing.

Now play with up to 6 players!\nCo-operative: All players are working together against the dungeon, which makes it easy for new players to join, even if they are not hardcore gamers.\nFast Paced: There are no turns. You\u2019re all racing against the clock to defeat the cards in the dungeon before time runs out!\nFlexible: Rounds are short\u2014only 5 minutes\u2014and you can swap between heroes or even add or drop players between rounds.\nTwo new heroes have joined the party, with powerful special abilities and a new deck of cards. With them by your side, you can now play with up to six players!\nEach of the bosses now gets their own custom deck of five Boss Cards, giving each dungeon its own unique personality.\nAnd the Boss Cards introduce a new type of card to the dungeon: Curses! These cards change the game in strange new ways, and once encountered, they stick around for the rest of the dungeon.\nThe heroes have unearthed six powerful Artifacts with game-changing effects. These are shared by the party, and you can use them whenever you want\u2026 but only once per dungeon! And the fewer heroes you have on your team, the more artifacts you bring along, giving a helpful boost to smaller parties.\nFor this campaign, we've decided to focus on community involvement rather than have stretch goals. We want you to get all the goodies we designed for this expansion, no matter how the funding turns out!\nSo, instead, over the two weeks of the campaign we'll be revealing cards and asking you to vote on the art and titles for some Kickstarter-exclusive cards. Check back often to see what's new and make your voice heard!\n5-Minute Dungeon is quick to set up and play.\nThe first thing you need to do is pick a hero! Like the Barbarian here...\nYou\u2019ll draw a hand of cards, some of which will be resource cards and action cards. Your team will also get a number of Artifact cards, depending on how many people are playing.\nFlip over the top card of the dungeon and start the timer! You now have 5 minutes to defeat every card in the dungeon, and the dungeon boss! (You can keep track using our handy-dandy timer app, too!)\n\nDoor cards come in three varieties: Monster, Obstacle, and Person. Most of the time you can defeat a Door Card by matching the symbols on the card. Sometimes, though, you'll want to use an action card, like Fireball, which can instantly defeat a Monster.\nThere are no turns, and anyone can play the cards needed to defeat the Dungeon Card. But be careful, any card played is gone forever, so play smart!\nSometimes your party will come across a Curse. These pesky cards affect the whole party right away and stay active for the rest of the dungeon... unless you can find a way to get rid of them, that is.\nAfter you\u2019ve dealt with all the door cards, it\u2019s time to take on the big boss himself\u2014the Baby Barbarian! Bosses take a lot more resources to defeat than any door card.\n\nWe're partnering with BackerKit to make it much easier for backers to manage their pledge choices and shipping information at the end of the campaign.\nWhen the campaign ends, you'll receive a BackerKit survey asking you to provide your shipping information so we can get your rewards to you. As part of this survey, you'll have your choice of the following add-ons:\nUPGRADE YOUR BOX: If you pledged at the Expansion or Expansion + KS Booster levels, you'll be offered a chance to upgrade your small expansion box to the larger curses box for $CDN 5. This is a perfect option if you really like the new box design, or if you like to put your cards in sleeves and you want the new tray with extra space for cards! No need to buy the game again... just upgrade your box! (Note: This upgrade is not a limited quantity item.)\nADD ON A BIG BOX: After the campaign ends, if there are any Big Box games left, each backer may add one additional Big Box to their pledge at the regular price ($50 CDN) for no additional shipping cost!\nADD ON MORE EXPANSIONS: Each backer can pledge for additional copies of the Expansion or Expansion + KS Booster editions at the regular price and at a reduced shipping rate of only $2 CDN per game! (Note: Additional expansions are not limited in quantity.)\n Rahdo Runs Through (Curses! Foiled Again!)\nGaming with Edo (Curses! Foiled Again!)\nGaming With Edo  (Base Game)\n Rahdo Runs Through (Base Game)\n Tom Vasel - Dice Tower  (Retail Edition)\n Epic Gaming Night - Curses! Foiled Again!\n Bearded Meeple - Curses! Foiled Again!\nWe\u2019ve developed a custom timer app for 5-Minute Dungeon, featuring 5 different narrators who call out the minutes and encourage your team (or, sometimes, mock you). Featuring the voice talents of Jon \u201cEpic Voice Guy\u201d Bailey, Becky Shrimpton, and Nick \u201cLanipator\u201d Landis, this app is a great companion to 5-Minute Dungeon. To celebrate the release of Curses! Foiled Again! we will be adding a new voice and new music to the timer app!\nIt\u2019s available for iOS, Android, and Windows devices, and best of all, it\u2019s completely free!\nWe are partnering with depots in the USA, Canada, Europe, and Australia to minimize the chances of additional duty and taxes being charged to you. Shipping to areas outside these regions may result in additional charges out of our control. Please research import regulations to learn about these potential costs for your country before placing an order.\nIn order to keep costs down and reduce the potential for errors, we cannot split orders to ship to multiple delivery locations. We allow a maximum of 1 delivery location per backer, regardless of reward levels or number of copies ordered. Currency Conversions\nRemember that your pledge is in Canadian Dollars, and your card will be billed in Canadian Dollars when the campaign ends. Currency exchange rates change regularly. Look at your local currency exchange rate toward the end of the campaign for the most current price.\nYou can check out more of Alex's awesome art here:\nSpecial Thanks\nMusic for the video & timer app were created by Kevin MacLeod.\nSeveral icons in this game were made by Lorc and Delapouite.

A mysterious outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly everyone there... what's worse is they are crawling the stores and commons as Zombies hungry for flesh. Only a few Survivors remain. Are you among the Survivors? Or are you one of the ravenous Zombies? The choice is yours in Tiny Epic Zombies!\nArm your Meeples for Survival with...\nBazooka and Katana included in Deluxe games only. Additional items unlockable through stretch goals.\n   Tiny Epic Zombies is a 30 minute, 1-5 player, game of survival that features 5 distinct play modes:\n1. Cooperative team-play with game controlled Zombies.\n2. Cooperative team-play with Zombies controlled by a non-team player.\n3. Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.\n4. Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.\n5. Solo.\nIn Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.\nWhy Back This Project? \nGreat Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action. Variable survivor and Zombie powers, and several objectives, keep you playing time and time again.\nGenerous Discount! Save almost 20% by pledging on Kickstarter.\nKS Limited Exclusive Content! - Deluxe copies will NOT enter regular distribution. Don't miss out on these awesome extras.\nBundled Deals! - Go in with a group to save even more!\nStretch Goals Galore! - Your pledge WILL improve the game and get everyone more awesomeness!\nITEMeeples\u00ae - Collect these unique items and equip them right to your Meeples!\n    This image has been updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\n    This image has been updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! However, due to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

The game is renowned for its tense, well-balanced mechanics. And it tells a great story. HANNIBAL crossing the Alps on his herd of elephants is one of the most memorable events in history.\nThe development team at PHALANX has given this game a careful, meticulous update. It is now easier and faster to play. It plays considerably shorter. It has received new, stunning art. It is even better than it used to be.\n20th Anniversary Edition prototype.\nThere is even another game in the box: HAMILCAR, which portrays the events of the First Punic War.\nAnd there's more to discover.\nClick here for description in French.\nClick here for description in German.\nClick here for description in Spanish.\nWhat's in the Box\nKickstarter Special Expansions\nGame overview\nHANNIBAL & HAMILCAR is a card-driven political game for 2 players set during the Second Punic War, the epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. That conflict has in many ways defined our modern reality. It took Rome over 100 years to win the competition with Carthage and three long wars were fought in the process. Our game takes considerably less time. Some scenarios are playable in under 30 minutes.\nHANNIBAL has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the world, Mark Simonitch. This 20th Anniversary Edition of the game includes new scenarios and variants. We have streamlined certain game mechanics, while producing exactly the same game results as the golden classic. The game original rules and components were updated by Mark Simonitch and Jaro Andruszkiewicz.\nHANNIBAL has won numerous awards, including the Golden Geek Best 2-Player Board Game Award and the Golden Geek Best Wargame Award, and is ranked 11th on the BoardGameGeek.com's Wargame Rankings.\nHANNIBAL is actually more of an asymmetrical political game than a wargame. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from a classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance.\nThe long-awaited HAMILCAR companion game is also included in the Anniversary Edition.\nHAMILCAR, which is set during the First Punic War, is a stand-alone game using similar mechanics. It introduces a naval system and exciting naval battles. Both players compete for control of the Mediterranean Sea, in a conflict which will be described as the first war between an elephant and a whale - the struggle of a land-based empire versus the world\u2019s naval power. Rome's goal was to break through the island chain of Sicily, Corsica, and Sardinia - Carthage's defensive line to contain Rome on the Italian peninsula.\nClick here to find more about the HAMILCAR game.\nExample of Gameplay\nHannibal begins in Spain and needs to move quickly to Italy if he wants to protect his allies in Gallia Cisalpina and secure the province.\n1. Carthage plays a Forced March card and moves Hannibal from Saguntum to Helvii.\n2. Rome plays Allied Auxiliaries from ETRURIA and brings P. Scipio army to 10 Combat Units.\n3. Hannibal, with the help of Native Guide sets out a journey across the Alps. He loses 1 Combat Unit to Attrition (roll of 3) and arrives in a friendly tribe space.\n4. Rome is itching for battle. A Campaign card is played and P. Scipio moves to meet Hannibal in a battle which will be remembered as the Battle of Trebbia.\nP. Scipio attacks with Frontal Attack in a true Roman style. This is matched by Hannibal, who seizes the Initiative. He attacks with his Right Flank and even if the Roman Consul is able to respond twice, he is unable to take the Initiative. Both sides lose 2 Combat Units each, and P. Scipio loses another 4 Combat Units in Retreat.\nP.Scipio retreats to Rome. The Roman player has to remove 3 Political Control markers as Political Consequences of the Battle.\n5. The Carthaginian player plays the Numidian Ally strategy card to place three Political Control markers in Gallia Cisalpina to seize control of the province.\n6. Cathage has established a foothold in Italy. Now Rome is in danger. Hannibal ante portas!\n20th Anniversary Edition features\nState-of-the-art map board.\nNew card illustrations based on historical sources.\nNew improved layout of the board, charts, and cards. \u201cLearn and Play\u201d playbook. Read a few pages, than play a scenario before moving forward.\n20 years of game development in a single box: includes 13 historical scenarios (e.g. First Punic War 264-241 B.C., Second Punic War 218-201 B.C., Post Cannae 215-201 B.C., Iberia 210-205 B.C., Italy 207-204 B.C., Africa 204-201 B.C.), and tutorial scenarios!\nLong-awaited HAMILCAR companion game. New map, strategy cards and leaders. And a handful of exciting new mechanics.\nLarge, 40 mm scale plastic leader miniatures in 16 different sculpts! Based on 7 mm tall and 25 mm wide round bases (with leader ratings), in red for Rome and blue for Carthage.\nPledge levels\nEach of these pledge levels includes the complete game, two Kickstarter Special Expansions, and any additional content we may generate during the campaign.

Here are some reviews of this all-time classic.\nVideo reviews\nWritten reviews\n\"If you like card driven games, and you've never tried Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, drop whatever it is you're doing right now and go get a copy. You won't regret it. If you like wargames in general, at the very least give this game a try... it might surprise you. If you're a euro player looking for a new introduction to wargaming, you couldn't find a better spot to jump in with both feet. I have played a fair number of card driven games (and this bears repeating so forgive me), but Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage remains my favorite. Its elegance, simplicity and relatively decent game time makes it the cream of the crop even after all these years. I don't care whether I'm winning or I'm losing (though of course I'd prefer the former), as long as I'm playing. Grab (or try) a copy.\" \n\"This game is exceptional. I love (nearly) everything about it and cannot begin to describe how much fun it is to play. I fear I cannot continue without repeating things I've already mentioned so I'll just leave it at this. Great game, if you can get your hands on it I heartily, heartily recommend you do so.\"\n\"Overall, the gameplay was everything I hoped it would be and more. Sweeping political struggle underpinned by tense tactical battles with varied and subtle consequences, this game really got under my skin in a good way. After 3 plays I think I have barely scratched the surface of this game, and I really look forward to delving deeper.\"\n\"The Art of \u201cCard Driven Game\u201d Design \u2013 Why Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage is the best CDG ever published?\"\nHow to play\nWalk-through videos\nExtended gameplay\n\"It was tightest, closest and most furious game I've ever had. The pendulum of fate swung from one side to another, stopping at the end on Carthaginian side. We both made mistakes and we both experienced how random this game can be but still it was one of best games I've ever played - by this I mean not only games of Hannibal but of all games I've ever played in my life. My rating of Hannibal Rome vs Carthage goes up from 9 to 10 and I could only wish it could further than that.\"\nStrategy tips\nProduction & delivery\nThe games are produced in EU (with miniatures and dice produced in China), keeping the normal high standards of PHALANX.

Thank you in advance for understanding, please pledge responsibly.\n\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5\nKingdom Death Monster is an massive cooperative board game about survival in a nightmare-horror world. Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive.

Shipments that could not be delivered due to an inaccurately provided address (including failure to update an old address) will have additional costs to be reshipped.

If this campaign meets with success we'll be on the hook to you guys for loads more quality content. The bigger we get, the more complex fulfillment will become.

This is likely going to require a custom run with the slide end sized to accommodate our specific webbing. This custom run will require us to extend the delivery dates into March to allow for production time. \nThese buckles will not be interchangeable since they are sewn directly onto the belt. This reinforced stitching also requires extra time on the machine and a skilled hand to ensure it's done properly. The price may seem significant for an upgrade, but the people that get it understand. Keep in mind this buckle has no location to store the signal mirror for the Adventure level backers. \n                      Our goal is to save lives.

Locating, capturing, and rebuilding the advertisements in this book took hundreds of hours and fifteen months from start to finished layout.\nSample pages.\nOnce the advertisements were assembled, I then started constructing the book in InDesign. To keep the book from being nothing more than page after page of gray and black images, I also tracked down toys, packages, catalogs, and assorted other materials and used those items to add some color to the pages. The above sample page spread, for example, shares an advertisement that includes the Anakin Skywalker free figure offer. I chased down an appropriate carded action figure and photographed the front and back of the packaging so that we could see both the newspaper ad and the associated offer as presented on an action figure package.\nSample pages.\nOver two hundred images fill this book and show us the sales, the clearance prices, and the popularity of Star Wars from 1977 to 1986. I was constantly surprised as I worked on the book, and I believe that everyone will find something new and entertaining between the covers of this hardcover.

Does that sound like you? Then you're in the right place, new best friend!\nNecronomiCards is a deviously simple game to learn. You start with two decks of cards: SPELLS and SUMMONS. \nSPELL Cards\nSpell cards each have 4-6 different magic symbols on them. Each player starts with 2 Spell cards and then draws 1 new card every turn. You can never have more than 6 Spell cards in your hand at once though. The goal is to pair up matching symbols across your Spell cards to create hands, sort of like a weird, alternate universe version of poker. \nOnce you've matched up a complete Spell hand, you trade it in to draw Summon cards. How many Summon cards you can draw in a turn depends on the complexity of the hand you trade in for it.\nSUMMON Cards\nSummon cards depict a deity, demon, or monster from a variety of mythological, religious, literary, or just plain made-up sources. Each Summon card has an ability that you can play against your competitors to make them lose turns, discard spell cards, or other nefarious setbacks. Each and every Summon card you play puts you one step closer to victory, until...\nFor a 30-45 minute game, the first person to play 7 Summon cards wins! Want a longer game? Really challenge yourself and play to 13 Summon cards. That's the basics. Pretty simple, huh? Oh, one little twist I forgot to mention...\nIncluded in the Summon deck are the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They're extremely powerful cards by themselves, but if by some unholy fluke you manage to draw and play all four of them in a game, you win instantly, no matter how many other Summon cards you've played.\nAnd...\nCURSE Cards\nShuffled into the Spell card deck are also Curse cards, which can totally throw off even the best player's strategy. They can make YOU lose turns, give other players cards, or other setbacks, so watch out! The tables can turn at any time and nobody is ever safe for long.\nNecronomiCards includes 40 meticulously illustrated Summon cards featuring entities from all over the mythological map. The sources range from literature (especially the grandfather of all weird horror, H.P. Lovecraft), the Bible (think fire & brimstone), Voodoo, Greek mythology, urban legends, and pop culture.\n   Backers who pledge $10 or more will receive a ton of awesome digital goodies, including NecronomiCards desktop graphics to fit pretty much any device and an ebook overflowing with NecronomiCards sketches, character designs, and high-res game art.\nBackers who pledge $35 or more will get a copy of NecronomiCards, the previous digital rewards, AND a hand-drawn sketch card of some super fun weirdness of my choice.\nBackers who pledge $50 or more will get the previous rewards and a limited edition signed poster of NecronomiCards art. Backers who pledge $75 or more will also get NecronomiCards t-shirt.\n The most epic reward of all, if you empty your pockets for the cause and pledge $500 you'll be immortalized in a work of weird, demonic art as a NecronomiCards Summon card yourself! Impress your friends! Worry your mother!! Attract the attention of (reasonably) attractive people!!! Have the satisfaction of knowing that strangers all over the world are using your likeness to attack their friends. PLUS you'll get a huge, one of a kind art print of the illustration to hang proudly in your home or office!\nWho or what will those additional Summon cards be? That's a surprise, but trust me, you'll like it.\nEverybody who selects the $35 or higher tier will get a super soft, thick, NecronomiCards branded cloth drawstring bag to store your cards in. We all know how worn out game packaging can get over time, so this will help your cards last even longer, while looking awesome at the same time.\nPretty-up your home with a foul, uncaring god as old as time! Everyone who pledges $10 or more will get a postcard-sized print of the art from the Cthulhu card. That means that even if you can't afford to get a copy of the game, you might still be able to get some of the art.\nOther possible stretch goal ideas I'm considering for down the road:\nI have ideas for dozens and dozens of cards that I didn't have room to fit into this deck, and I plan to release expansion or booster decks in the future. I plan to use the extra money to speed up that process and crank out even more awesome cards. I have some really fun ideas based on more mythological monsters, horror and sci-fi movies, real historical creeps, and more.\nI'm also toying with the idea of putting together a physical book with the game art. I have a ton of in-progress sketches and unused monster design ideas, not to mention enormous versions of all of the game's art, that would make for a great coffee-table book. That may end up being a higher-tier stretch goal.\nTwo of the many, many sketches that I'd love to make into an art book.\nNecronomiCards\u2122 is the creative baby of designer & illustrator Andy Hunt. I've been hired to do art for people like Adult Swim, Marvel Comics, ABC, Hasbro, and Cracked.com, and I've designed shirts sold at just about every cool place you can buy a shirt. I hand illustrated each NecronomiCard based on some of my favorite characters and creatures from mythology, horror, and world religion. I've put a massive massive amount of time (seriously, ask my wife), research, and testing into designing this game. It's truly a labor of love, and I'm really excited to finally unleash it upon the world!\nAdditionally, game design consultation was provided by Zach Lowery, a 10 year game industry veteran with a background that includes the bulk of the Saints Row franchise and is currently working on LawBreakers at Boss Key Productions. He has graciously volunteered his wealth of knowledge and experience to help make this the most fun game it can be!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nZero! Zip! Nada! \n\nWell, practically... I guess there are always risks... \n\nI've already finished most of the work designing and illustrating the game, started sourcing printers, and started play-testing and tweaking the gameplay with some of the world's best volunteers (my nerdy, nerdy friends). All that's left to do is finish ironing the last few kinks out of the mechanics and get the game itself (and the backer rewards) manufactured and in your hands, so if anything will be an issue at this point it will be the possibility of unforeseen printing or shipping delays (a lot of the companies that can quickly produce high quality tarot-sized custom cards and packaging are on the other side of the world from me). If we start getting into stretch goal territory, any additional things that I create for those goals may not fit within the initial timeline I've laid out, but I'll keep everybody updated in detail on how those progress.\n\nOn top of that, I'm keeping my goal amount to the minimum needed to affordably fund a small run of tarot-sized decks with custom packaging. I'm not in this for money, I just want to put my game in people's hands. Most of the extra money will go to rewards, marketing, and coming up with fun ways to keep expanding the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "48 Hours left to back Kickstarter Vol 2!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "One week left to back NecronomiCards Vol 2!", "update_content": " "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "NecronomiCards at NC Comicon: Oak City", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "The NecronomiCards Vol 2 Kickstarter is live at kickstarter.necronomicards.com", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Cloth bags for sale + Retail news", "update_content": "Hey, everybody!

That means you should all be getting the game much sooner than I'd originally planned. Boom. \n\nThere is a small down-side to this though. In order for that to work out affordably, I need to have the game shipped directly from the manufacturer to one of CAH's warehouses. If I have it shipped to me first and to them I basically have to pay double the shipping costs (which is a LOT of money when you're shipping thousands of decks of cards) AND also double the length of the shipping time.

It should be fun. We found a real problem with winter coats. If the weather turns bad, and you don't have your gloves or anything to cover your face, you are not protected. \nSmart Parka is the first winter coat ever with built in gloves, a built in scarf, a removable lining for extra cold days and an extension to turn your hip-length parka into a mid-length coat. \nHow much does it cost?\nWe think it's just fair that we reward those who help us make it happen. \nSuggested Retail: $740 - We will never offer this coat for a price lower than this deal after the end of this campaign.\n\nWhat styles do these coats come in?\nSmart Parka comes in 4 different styles for women and 3 different styles for men. We have something to fit every personality.\nTake a look at Smart Parka styles\nCheck out each of our styles for men and women and the colors available. \nSome Great Features of SMART PARKA\nSuper soft yet water resistant leather gloves with the thinnest and warmest insulation. Designed specifically for Smart Parka, the gloves tuck neatly inside the zippered pockets in the coat's sleeves.\n \nBuilt-in scarf to cover you up when the wind suddenly starts to howl.\nTablet pocket designed to comfortably fit an iPad, can hold onto most tablets, clutch, notebook etc.\nGlasses pocket to keep your reading glasses, sunglasses, or ski goggles safe and handy.\nCoat extension gives you extra length for particularly cold days or a winter night out in a nice dress. \n\nRemovable interior layer makes the coat adaptable to different temperatures, so you can be comfortable every day of the winter season. Duplicate pockets on each layer means that the coat's functionality is never compromised.\nPhone Pocket keeps your phone safely close at hand while supporting your headphones to offer a seamless connection.\nHat pocket lets you stash your toque (as we call them in Canada), belaclava, ski hat, cossack, trapper, etc.\nTracker tag pocket inside the coat fits most commercial tracker tags so that you can locate your coat if you've left it somewhere or when you're scrambling to get out the door.\nWater resistant exterior protects you from the wetter elements and drivers who can't be bothered to slow down for puddles. \nOTHER FEATURES\nHand warming fleece pockets for extra comfort.\nHeavy-duty, YKK\u00ae zipper\nFill : White Duck Down (inner lining), Synthetic Insulation (outer and gloves)\nFur : Faux fur\nIMPORTANT: All features are available in all the models with the two exceptions\na. There is no extension for the Bomber (Men and Women)\nb. There is no removable lining for the Vogue (Women)\nThe Bomber's design excludes an extension and the Vogue (Women) has an integrated inner layer already.\nULTIMATE QUALITY MATERIALS:\nCoats made for serious weather need serious materials. We've chosen the sturdiest hardware and fabrics with the ideal balance between luxurious feel and durability.\nWe reached our first stretch goal of $500k so every backer gets our \"Backer Only Edition\" T-shirt with their coat, absolutely free!\nIf you do not absolutely love your coat, just return it within two weeks and get a full refund of your pledge minus shipping and handling. No questions asked. \n   EXCHANGE POLICY:\nWe are happy to exchange your coat for any reason. Just return your Smart Parka plus the shipping fee and we will send you another one right away.\nSIZING CHART\nWHAT IS MY SIZE?\nThe Bomber is a \"relaxed fit\" mode. The rest of the models are slim to average fit. You will be told which popular brands they are most comparable to at the time of the survey.

I\u2019m creating an awesome little keychain from at least 16 parts. The 16th part is your opinion. Join me for the journey. Brent\nPLAY\n\n   PLAY\n\nWhat is Gravity XS?\nThe XS is a gravity assisted mechanical claw. When it touches down gravity pushes the jaws open. Lifting it closes the jaws around your prize. The design is based off of the original Gravity Hook. This one is just eXtra Small. So whether you dropped a sock behind the dryer or you need a little entertainment at the DMV, you'll have the answer in your pocket. \nYes! It opens bottles!\nWhy I need your support.\nAs a keychain, I needed to figure out a way to keep the jaws locked but also make it possible to have the jaws move freely. My solution is a custom spring. But in actuality, all the parts for this project have to be custom made. None of it will exist without you. I've been working with the design and now I need your support to make it out of Stainless Steel. With your backing I'll fine tune everything and get it shipped to your front door. I invite you to every step of the way. \nSpring action lock.\n A conical spring keeps the jaws shut until you compress it. With your help I'll have a conical spring custom made. \nLocked in place.\nJust below you can see the original Gravity Hook video. There was much debate over the design. Since then the original Gravity Hook has been improved. This design allows you to lock the cross hook in place with a pin instead of having to tighten bolts. The improved original is available during this project!\n Dueling Claws for the most candy. Who doesn't like a little friendly competition? Lay out some candy and see who gets the most. Yes, your kids will love it.\nPLAY\n\n The XS is just the right size to fit in your 5th pocket. Low profile hardware will make it possible. Traditional nuts and bolts are just too bulky. My goal is to have a custom headless grooved pin made.  \nAnchor right into your 5th pocket.\nThe parts, pins, and springs all have to be custom made. \nAn example of the pins we need made to size for this project.\nWhile installed, the jaws stay shut unless the spring is compressed.\nThe XS compared to the original Gravity Hook.\nThe XS has a 3/16\" hole which is a perfect fit for paracord. The XS is about half the size of the original Gravity Hook. \n As always, we will ask you about your opinion in the design. I think that jimping would be a helpful feature. \nEdge jimping is a possible design modification. What do you think?\n Some of the hardware I've looked into includes rivets, and nuts and bolts. They all have there pros and cons but I think the grooved pins are the lowest profile option. Plus they just look cool. \nPossible hardware options.\nThis conical spring matches the angles of the linkages. With your help we will get a custom spring made.\n Kickstarter has allowed us to offer the improved original. This version includes a pin hole for holding the cross hook. The hammers have been reinforced to compensate for the removed material. The linkages also have the o-ring slots removed. \nImproved Original.

There won\u2019t be any radical changes, but the final product may have modifications when all is said and done. Any changes are intended to improve what arrives at your doorstep. \n\nProject delays. Large scale manufacturing can delay completion. The larger an order the longer the lead time will be. If we get to the point where we need help fabricating, finding that help will take time. We've had experiences where folks tell us they can do a certain service but then find out it was past their capability. \n\nWe are a small business trying to make cool stuff. We are not a traditional large scale operation and we do not a have a dedicated facility or full time staff. I am a regular guy with a wife, 4 kids, and a full time job.

We love monsters and skeletons! To make a long story short, our fondness for the Skeleton Warriors figures from the 90's led us to investigate the possibility of redesigning and updating the characters...starting with the bad to the bone Baron Dark!\nOriginally launched in 1994, it happens to be the 20th anniversary of the Skeleton Warriors brand, which seems like the perfect time to revamp and update these ridiculously fun characters!\nAs toy collectors ourselves, we are designing these figures with collectors in mind and drawing inspiration from both the 90's cartoon characters as well as original concept art provided by the awesome team at Goddard Film Group, LLC.\nPossibly the coolest feature of these new figures is that they are Glyos compatible!\nThe Glyos System, developed by the insanely talented Matt Doughty of Onell Design, is a system for making action figure parts interchangeable and is currently used by several independent toy companies. These figures utilize Glybrid style joints, which allows for a combination of traditional insert molded articulation with the swivel based Glyos fit functions. We have been working closely with Matt throughout our development process to ensure maximum compatibility while still maintaining the unique characteristics of the Skeleton Warriors.\nThat means you can break these figures apart, reassemble them, and even use the parts interchangeably with other Glyos System brands such as The Four Horsemen's Power Lords, Outer Space Men, and even classic Onell Design Glyos figures!\nBaron Dark\n5\" fully painted PVC action figure\n17 modular official Glyos compatible pieces\n26 points of articulation\nComes with removable sword, cape, loin cloth, and arm guards (for a total of 21 pieces)\nPackaged in full color collectors window box\nAvailable in original colors and Kickstarter exclusive Lightstar Crystal Translucent Blue\nThis is designed to be a 1/18th scale line of articulated PVC action figures. Baron Dark is the biggest of the main cast of characters and clocks in at 5\" tall with 26 points of articulation and sword! Future figures will remain in scale; so for instance, Prince Lightstar will be 3 3/4\" tall.\nAs you can see, we have Baron Dark ready to go into production as the first figure of our updated Skeleton Warriors line. That's where you, the amazing Kickstarter community come in!\nAlong with Baron Dark, we have organized some great incentives including...\nTitan Skeleton\nMonster sized 5\" fully articulated unpainted PVC action figure\n17 modular official Glyos compatible pieces\n26 points of articulation\nAvailable in bone, glow-in-the-dark, and the Kickstarter exclusive Lightstar Crystal Translucent Blue\nThis skeleton figure is the perfect complement to every skeleton army! This massive 5\", PVC, unpainted Glyos compatible figure comes in a bag and is the basic building block for all sorts of action figure adventures. Like Baron Dark, he is a big baddie! We have two versions available - bone and glow-in-the-dark!\nTraveler Skeleden\n2.75\" PVC official Glyos action figure\n13 interchangeable parts\n12 points of articulation\nNew axe accessory (first melee weapon for Pheyden)\nSpecial First Edition available exclusively through this Kickstarter!\nWe have collaborated with Matt Doughty (Onell Design) to create a fantastic new addition to the Glyos Universe...meet Skeleden! Part Pheyden, part skeleton, a special version of Skeleden will be available exclusively through this Kickstarter campaign.\nPlease note this is a work in progress picture. More pictures coming soon!\nBaron Dark Collectors Statue\nThis incredible 15\" Baron Dark statue was sculpted by the talented Owen Oertling and is being offered as an extremely limited collectible piece exclusively for this Kickstarter! Modeled after the Baron Dark statue from the finale (episodes 12 & 13) of the Skeleton Warriors cartoon, this resin statue is limited to only 10 pieces!\nPlease note that this picture is of the unpainted prototype, not the final product. It will be painted to resemble stone like in the cartoon.\nPlease note that all pledge levels include shipping in the United States.\nAvailable Add-Ons\nStretch Goals\nIf the interest and support are there, we are ready and willing to continue this new line of Skeleton Warriors immediately! We already have prototypes ready for our first two stretch goals which include the Skeleton Guard and Skeleton Soldier.\nIf we make it past those goals, it's on to the Legion of Light with Prince Lightstar, Grimskull, and Talyn!\nOnce unlocked, stretch goal add-on figures will be available for an additional $20 each and will be delivered separately from Baron Dark & Skeletons at a later date to be announced.\nPlease consider supporting Baron Dark so that we can continue to expand and grow this line with the Legion of Light figures, more bad guys like Aracula and Dr. Cyborn, 3 3/4\" skeletons, vehicles, and even the elusive Bone Dragon!\nWhy Skeleton Warriors you might ask?\nGrowing up as action figure fans and monster aficionados, we were naturally drawn to the crazy fun Skeleton Warriors toy line when it debuted in 1994. It more than delivered on the rad skeleton aspect and while they were awesome figures overall, it was always a little disappointing that the skeletons lacked much articulation and were basically stuck in a very limited amount of poses. That, combined with the fact that we were teased with a series 2 that was never produced, led us to investigate the possibility of creating brand new, updated Skeleton Warriors figures...and with your help, that's exactly what we're doing!

The deck will be printed by EPCC (Expert Playing Card Company at Conjuring Arts - NYC). I met the owner in person and checked the variety of paper stocks and finishing. \nEPCC is more flexible, dynamic and responsive than USPCC. They have lower costs and this means lower prices for the backers. \nThe cards are printed with more precision and the Master Finish give a smooth feeling. If you have a Zenith or an Exquisite deck, you know what I mean.\n\nTime to delivery is almost the same as USPCC. I will send the files of the cards during the campaign. Delays might happen, but I'll be as fast as possible, as I did for Requiem.\n\nMany things might go wrong, you never know, the devil is in the details. I'll keep my eyes open and follow every single step of the project to make it real.
