Making waves and alerting the wrong people to their efforts nearly cost them their lives.\nThe case then took them to Austria to seek out the next piece to this chaotic puzzle of murder and mayhem they've found themselves wrapped up in.\nNOW...\nThe crime-solving couple is headed to Romania to discover what type of vile creature is murdering the townspeople.

He created their majordomo Pneuman.\nANNIE (Lady Anastasia Elizabeth Ravenscroft)\nAnnie is a forward thinker for her time. She's brazen and outspoken, yet classy and alluring.

It is 8-pages long, but that's just the comics part.  There's also a cover and a back cover and some other words my Dad told me to write on the inside so everyone knows I'm the one who made it.  \n5.5\" x 8.5\", 8-page, black and white, comic book +cover\nIn the story, there's this guy with a horn, his name is Honk, and he has some friends named Pig and G.  \"G\" stands for goat, but he doesn't exactly look like a goat.  And there's also a bully when they go to this school.  He's not very nice, but the story kind of shows what to do in a situation like that.\n\nI'm a 7-year-old boy and I'm good at Math and I like to draw.  It's nice to draw.  And also I'm a tall kid in my class.  My name is Owen.  \n\nWhy I'm sending this out is because it's not a good thing to be bullied.  You should stand up to that bully if they are bullying you or someone else.  If you see a bully bullying someone else, then you are a bystander and you should report the bullying, the same as if someone was bullying you.\n\n\nHonk and Freands - \"Jungle Gym\", full-color, limited-edition, 5.5\" x 8.5\", print.\nAuthor with Original Artwork (8.5\" x 11\", marker and crayon)\n\nMe and my dad are printing Honk comic books so we can send them out to people.  My dad has some experience making and giving comics to people.  He's a comic artist, he makes watches, and he even has some comics classes that he teaches.\n\nMy parents asked me how much money I would be happy with.  $20 sounds like a lot to me, so that's what my dad put as our goal.\n\nAfter we make the books, then we will send them out to people who would like the Honk comic.  My dad has this weigher thing just for mail, so we can weigh it and then we will know how much it costs to mail it.  Then we can just mail it to people who want it.  \n\nThis is the way we think our plan will happen:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHm...well, some risks and challenges that I might include are that the comic we send off to you in the mail might come a little bit late, because our mail service is a little behind these days because a lot of people don't want to go to the store. So, the mail people have a lot on their shoulders. Like me, I had to wait for a remote control stunt car that took 3 more days than what they told me. So when we mail the books it might take a little while. But to help that, me and my dad are saying, \"Maybe it'll take one or two weeks longer,\" just so we have enough time. He says this is a contingency. \n\nSomething else I wanted to say is that the entire comic book is already drawn, so you won't have to wait for me to finish that.\n\nAnother risk could be, you know, what if our printer doesn't have any printing-out stuff. But to make sure that doesn't happen, we have an extra load of that stuff that helps the printer print stuff out. \n\nMy dad is also helping me a lot by printing the comic and typing what I say here. My mom said she would help, too, but I don't know with what part. Maybe stapling the comics and packing them up. So, it's not just me working on this.

Read more about them here!\nKhajad  Laohua has no memory of her past, no explanation as to why she has magical powers or why she must hide her peculiar white demon wings from society. Her mother, Yunika, thinks it's best to avoid  answering any of Khajad's questions. For now, they must figure out a way to escape what is certain to become their icy graves at the Peak of the World. Together, they venture to find a place called \"home\" and a means of living a normal life.\nBut can their lives ever really be \"normal?\"\nSacrimony: A Tale of Love, Life and Death - In No Particular Order #1  is a 30 page standard comic book in full color. It features beautiful art,  a diverse cast of fully fleshed-out characters and colorful, unique fantasy world! Other rewards include stickers, enamel pins, magnets, prints and custom commissions.\nIf you're into character-driven stories dealing with complex relationships such as the Avatar series and Game of Thrones, then Sacrimony is perfect for you.\n(Recommended for mature readers on account of language and adult situations)\n\n\nHi there! I'm M Sorcier, the sole creator behind Sacrimony: A Tale of Love, Life and Death - In No Particular Order. I'm a self-taught artist and writer born and raised in New York and a first generation immigrant hailing from the teeny Caribbean island nation of Trinidad and Tobago. \nUnlike many other comic creators my age, I didn't spend my younger years hanging around my local comics shop and writing letters to Stan Lee with dreams of working for Marvel. I couldn't afford comics and all I really had was pencils, paper and an imagination that won't quit. I developed a passion for art and telling stories at a very early age, but I didn't know what to do with that passion or what my options even were.\nLife ended up taking over and while my peers were out studying art, writing their scripts, getting books published and running super successful Kickstarter campaigns, I was out working minimum wage retail jobs and dead-end internships, with no real direction in life, while still pursuing art and storytelling as just a thing I did to keep sane.\nSacrimony was an idea that I had in my head since my early teenage years but I didn't really start doing anything with it until my early 30's. So here I am at the tender age of 36, fearing that I stepped into the game way \"too late\", but I'm still trying my best.\nI created Sacrimony because I wanted the kind of story I never had  growing up. I could never really relate to the stories that had clear-cut, black-and-white heroes and villains because they just never felt like real life to me. Despite being a fantasy story with imaginary settings and races, Sacrimony at its core, is a story of love, family, friendship and what it means to be \u201chuman.\u201d Everyone is multi-faceted and capable of good, bad and everything in between and they\u2019ll do whatever they have to in order to navigate the world and cope with being dealt a bad hand in life.\nHonestly? Because I have no other means of getting my books out there.  I have a story that I want to tell and Kickstarter is such a great way to be able to raise the funds to actually do it while finding a wonderful, passionate audience. Not only that, self-publishing through Kickstarter allows me to have full creative control over my own project which is something that is very important to me.\nFunds will be used for the cost of printing the books and all other merch, kickstarter fees, and covering the costs of shipping. If I have  anything left over, I might buy myself some ice cream to celebrate.  Because I'm worth it!\nWant to see what happens next? You can download an extended preview here!

I'm Lisa LaRose, a Canadian painter and comic artist. I love to make detailed and delightful paintings from the strange ideas that pop into my head.  I spend my days painting in acrylics or making comics, and I earn my keep by selling paintings/prints and other items online.  This will be my third Kickstarter project!\nI spend an average of 100 hours working on each painting.\nSome of the places you can find me/ see more of my art and art-making:\n Website             Etsy             Instagram             Twitter             Facebook             TikTok \n\nSo why make puzzles?\nI love doing puzzles, but often when I am shopping for a new puzzle, I have a hard time finding an image that appeals to me. Cottages, landscapes, and balls of yarn are well and dandy... but where is the WEIRD STUFF?\nSo I thought...  what if I made my art into puzzles?\nThis Kickstarter is for funding the first 3 of my puzzle designs!\n I have these 3 designs planned, proofed, and ready to be printed!  \nPuzzles are a fun activity to do solo or with friends/ family. They make a great gift too! \nBased on my puzzle experience, these puzzles are a medium-difficulty. If you are concerned about difficulty, Toad Queen is the easiest of the three. Pick Star Fish if you are feeling up for more of a challenge.\n1000 pieces!\n Completed puzzle size: 20\"x 27\" (50cm x 70cm)\n Box size: 9.25\" x 7.75\" x 2.25\" (24cm x 20cm x 6cm)\n Bonus half-size poster print included (no fighting over the box top!)\nStandard puzzle size.\nSince I love to do puzzles myself, there were a few things that were absolutely necessary for my puzzles to have. After many many months of sampling and researching, I have a manufacturer that meets all my needs!\n\n1) Good color reproduction\nMy art is all about color and I wanted that to translate to the puzzles\n\n 2) A cute box (the ability to use my own design) \nThe design looks really nice on this cute lil' box size!\n\n3) Pieces with unique shapes\nI wanted all the standard shapes and enough variation in the cut so you definitely know when it's the right piece.\nThey aren't as crazy as some puzzles I've seen, but they are unique enough to help when it comes to those tricky areas.\n\n4) Pieces stick together\nYou can work on sections and move them into place no problem! Heck, you can even pick up the whole puzzle without it falling apart! (see the gif above)\n*PLEASE NOTE* shipping will not be charged via Kickstarter and will be collected later using Backerkit. \nPlease consult this table for shipping price estimates:\nThese estimates are based on shipping prices right now (in March) and may change slightly if postage rates go up between now and when the shipping is collected.\n Canadians: One of the advantages of Backerkit is I can charge shipping by province/region. The prices in the chart are the highest estimates. Shipping will be slightly cheaper than this for BC, AB, SK, ON, QC.\n\nVANCOUVER LOCAL PICKUP: *New* For those in the Vancouver, BC area who want to pick up your rewards (and not pay shipping), I will have a free local pickup option at New World Designs located downtown Vancouver near Waterfront Station.\n\nYou MUST check your email: \nPlease use an email that you will check, and keep an eye out for emails from Kickstarter and Backerkit. If you do not fill out your Backerkit survey when it is sent to you, I will not be able to send you your puzzles. \nYou should also keep an eye on your email in case your Kickstarter payment doesn't go through. If there is an issue when Kickstarter tries to collect your payment when the campaign is over, you will have only 1 week to fix it.\n\n\nTimeline: \nI currently have a deposit down for 500 Life puzzles to secure my quote pricepoint. Once the goal has been met, I will increase my deposit to include the 500 Star Fish and 500 Toad Queen puzzles.  \n\nOnce the campaign ends, it will take 2 weeks for Kickstarter to give me the funds so that I may pay for the order. I will also need to send out surveys (for those getting multiple puzzles) so can confirm I am ordering the right amount of each design.\n\nPuzzle production is estimated to take 1 month. Due to the size and weight of the puzzles, they must be shipped to me via boat, which will take 35-38 days. \n\nI will be fulfilling/ shipping international (non-USA) orders first, as they will have the slowest shipping time. The current time estimation is August 2021. \n\n\nKickstarter video music:\nEasy Lemon by Kevin MacLeod\nhttps://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3697-easy-lemon/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u2022COVID: We aren't out of the woods yet, and outbreaks could cause delays in manufacturing/ shipment.\nSome countries may not be accepting packages from Canada, so please check with your local post office.\n\n\u2022Increase in material costs/ crazy changes in USD or CAD: Part of why I am running now and not closer to the gift-giving-Christmas-season, is that paper prices are increasing and I wanted to keep my current quote locked down.\n\n\u2022Project TOO successful-could cause shipping delays: Seriously, depending on how many backers we get, I may need to hire some outside help for packaging and shipping orders.

Dance is something that is seen as beautiful, but many don\u2019t think about the pain that is done to one\u2019s body to truly be a dancer. Martial arts are thought of as violent because it\u2019s a form of \u201cfighting\u201d, but there\u2019s also a dance like quality to this work of art.\nBut once you dig deeper, the reader will quickly realize that The Dancer is actually a story about mental health.

Each issue features complete, stand-alone stories that are always exciting, sometimes humorous, and occasionally downright scary.\n(Okay,  it's not that scary. There are no nightmares here. But we've learned that young readers love the idea of reading comics their parents think are too scary for them.) \nWe're using this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to print the 33-page issue, House of Fear: Rubber & Glue, and hopefully, we'll hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way for some additional items. \nWhat's it About?\nOur first story, \"Rubber & Glue,\" introduces us to a couple of students from Savini Middle School.\nCaden and Isaac aren't exactly friends. \nAnd everything is most certainly not okay here. \nCaden thinks he has the upper hand, as always. But this time, he's in for a shock. Isaac isn't just repeating a childish retort...\n...but instead is casting a curse. One that will force Caden to live a day in the life of the bullied. \nThis story isn't the Monster-of-the-Month fare you've come to expect from House of Fear, but instead, examines the roles we play in middle school, and shines light on just how easy a harmless prank becomes something worse. It's as if Stephen King wrote an after-school special. \nThis issue also features a backup story, \"The Trees Have Eyes.\" This one starts peacefully enough, with Tosh and his dad out for a pleasant hike in the woods. \nWell, maybe not so peaceful or pleasant for Dad. And when they venture off the trail...\n...and into a copse of aspen trees, things take a turn for the worse.\nTrust me, you'll never look at Aspen trees the same again. \nWhat to Expect\nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nOne issue featuring two complete, stand-alone stories.\n33 pages of full-color thrills.\nFun, exciting comics suitable for (almost) all ages.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nWe print House of Fear domestically, which means a faster turn around time (within 2 months of the campaign end).  \nWe're now printing on a heavy 70 lb paper stock with a 100 lb cover stock.  A heavier stock means the comics stand up to multiple reads and make the book more suitable for sharing. \nStretch and Milestone Goals\nWe recently had our 175th backer, which means every backer gets a set of print-at-home activity pages. This set includes prompts for kids to draw their own monsters and comics, and of course, also includes coloring pages. \nIf we reach 200 backers, all backers will receive a PDF of the B&W version of The Trees Have Eyes. See Jethro's line work in all its glory in this special version of the story. \nIf we reach 225 backers, I'll upgrade the Digital Deluxe PDF to a full, behind-the-scenes, making of book. I received lots of feedback after our last campaign for this style of book, and I'm excited for the opportunity to do it again for Rubber & Glue.\nOur First Kickstarter Exclusive Variant\nWe're big fans of the old EC comics, so for this campaign, we created our first variant cover as an homage to those horror comics from the 50s. Those are James Hislope's lines, and Josh Jensen's colors, with Matt Krotzer on letters and design. They absolutely nailed it, didn't they?\nAs a way to reward backers with a piece of House of Fear history, the variant is an exclusive to Kickstarter. We'll print to order (with an overage of 10% to cover possible damage during transit), so don't expect too many of these to make it to my online shop or to convention tables. \nThe Rare, Serialized Variant\nWe've also got a rare variant for this campaign. This one features art by Jethro Morales and colors by Josh Jensen. There will be no House of Fear trade dress on the cover. Just the frightful artwork. \nEach copy will be individually serialized to only 31 copies. \nBoyle Minifig\nWe've partnered with Justin at Saber-Scorpion to produce a limited-edition Boyle minifig. The look and accessories are specific to this issue and will only be made available during this campaign. \nThe image below is a prototype of what you can expect.\nExclusive, Crossover Print\nOur first House of Fear crossover is here! Anyone who backs a physical reward for this campaign and the one for Phil Falco's Haunting 1-3 will receive this exclusive print, signed by the writers on both books. (Digital backers who back both will receive a digital version of the art.)\nStunning art by Jethro Morales and Josh Jensen\nHaunting is a solid, supernatural horror comic for teens and adults. So if you have older kids in your house or if you like to sample new horror for yourself, now's the time to try something new!  \n The Rewards \nAdd Ons\nIf you've backed a print tier, you can add additional print copies of House of Fear: Rubber & Glue. You can also catch up on all of the House of Fear comics with the Digital Catch Up add on. We have stickers, too!\nAfter you select a tier to back, Kickstarter will take you to the Add-On page. If you see another issue you'd like to have, simple select it from the Add-On page. \nOther print issues of House of Fear will be available as add-on options after the campaign has ended.\nPreview Pages\nBelow are pages from House of Fear: Rubber & Glue.\nShipping and Delivery\nOur young readers aren't overly concerned with mint comics. All they care about is reading the story....and rereading it as many times as possible. \nBut there are a lot of collectors reading House of Fear, too. We know true horror is getting a Kickstarter package in the mail and finding a crumpled comic inside.\nWith that in mind, we pack our books with the same care we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers.\nAll comics come bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. \nAll packages will be sent via USPS Media Mail, First Class, or Priority Mail, depending on weight.\nTimeline and Budget\nThe comic is 100% complete, so all we need to do is send the issue and sticker sheet to the printers. After 2-3 weeks, I'll start shipping everything to backers. \nBut where do the funds go?\nAbout half of the funds we earn through Kickstarter will be used to print the comic and other rewards. Shipping will take approximately 40% of the funds we receive, and 10% goes to Kickstarter for hosting the campaign.\nAny extra money we earn from the campaign will help pay for future issues of House of Fear.\n Meet the Creators \nWill You Help Us Make Comics for Kids?\nIt's simple: We love making fun, exciting comics, and we want to get them to as many readers as I possibly can. We can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. We hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making exciting, action-packed comics for kids.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my FIFTH Kickstarter campaign! The comic is already complete, and all we have left to do is print the comic and other rewards. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and we know how important it is for backers to get their rewards in a timely manner. So we plan to do everything we can to meet your expectations. Of course, if anything comes up that throws us off schedule, we will keep Kickstarter backers updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE\nThank you/credit in PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["54 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Deluxe Digital", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of HOUSE OF FEAR: RUBBER & GLUE, which includes bonus behind-the-scenes art pages.

I was a storyboard artist on Classic Tales and Bob\u2019s Burgers.\nI'm so proud of my comic books, and they're only made possible through Kickstarter.\n\nIn 2018 I funded my first graphic novel on Kickstarter, Sneaky Goblins: an all-ages story of fantasy mayhem, inspired by Adventure Time cartoons, Tolkien and World of Warcraft. I followed that up with two new comics: Sneaky Goblins at College in 2019, and Mythic Creature Trainer #1 in 2020.\n Some of the films, TV and comics I've worked on: \nI've always loved drawing and telling stories.

Grow crops, nurture animals, and befriend the islanders. Decide whether to revitalize not only the town but also the surrounding coral reefs.  \nPromising to keep intact what makes classic farm sim games fun, Coral Island aims to modernize and make the experience more inclusive. We feature a large cast of diverse characters and weave environmental awareness into the core game loop \u2014  all the while keeping it a wholesome good time.\n\n\nThere are over 50 islanders living on Coral Island. Coming from all walks of life, get to know these people by chatting them up \u2014 extra brownie points for gifts!\n\nTransform your overrun land into a lush and lively farm. Find your play style by deciding what crops to grow, which animals to nurture, or what structures to build.\nChoose from a variety of crops, flowers, fruit plants, and trees. There are over 75 plantables in the game, ranging from age-old classics to the exotic and obscure native to Asia.\nCrops are seasonal, which means they only grow in a specific season. However, some crops can be planted in multiple seasons and be re-harvested every several days. \nFruit plants take 11 days to mature. They are bi-seasonal, able to grow 2 seasons out of the year, and will wither offseason. Does not need to be watered after maturity.\nFruit Trees take 28 days to mature and will not wither off-season. They bear 1 fruit a day, every day for the season, and will continue to bear fruit every year.\n\nMake a living by caring for animals and raising livestock. Though you'll first need to build a coop or barn to house them! These farm animals can be left outside during the day and will return inside as night falls.\n\n\nPoultry are farm animals that live in a coop. If fed daily, mature poultry usually produces 1 egg, and sometimes, a feather.\n\nBarn-dwelling animals range from the traditional Sheep and Cow to Luwak and Llamas. They need to be brushed and fed daily to keep their produce flowing.\n\nDive into the ocean to restore the coral reefs! Select a diving spot around the island, and unlock deeper levels to explore. Unravel all that the ocean has to offer.\nClean up the sea bed to make a home for rare fish, and collect ocean kelp to hone the quality of livestock and crop.\nBring processed kelp to Ling's Lab to permanently upgrade the quality of your products. Decide which you'll upgrade first: seeds, saplings, seedlings, fodder, or bait.\n16 singles and ready to mingle. Sweep them off their feet and find the one. Find out what their personalities are like, take them on a date, and fall in love!\n Unlock various relationship scenes and when you're ready, build a life together at the farm \u2014 perhaps even have children. Yes, no, maybe?\nGo deep into the caverns to mine precious gemstones \u2014 use the loot to upgrade your tools and farm. But beware, monsters protect rare finds so bring a weapon or two!\nPacked with a variety of outfits, accessories, and options to choose from, you are armed with plenty of styles to express yourself. Conform to the community or be different! There is no wrong answer because there is only one you in Coral Island.\nSelect 1 out of 3 starter houses. Upgrade, decorate\u2026 personalize! Purchase furniture, collect paintings and display exclusive decorations. Welcome home, Farmer.\nCatch a variety of fish, starfish, and squid! There are also crabs at the beach. Fun fact! Several freshwater and saltwater fish can only be caught at specific seasons or certain times (i.e: at summer dawn, or rainy winters).\nCoral Island was once home to an expansive variety of aquatic life. As you restore the island's ecosystem, more types of fish will be available to catch. Perhaps, you'll even cross paths with something legendary?\nLevel up! As you make your way around the island, you will earn skill points that can be invested into skills. \nDecide on a path and create an experience unique to you. Along the way, you'll unlock new, exciting techniques that might come in handy on the farm!\nGet busy and immerse yourself in Coral Island! You can pick projects to work on or a fun skill to develop in your free time... or not. Your time, your choice. Here are some of the additional features in Coral Island worth noting.\nImprove the town: Take part in community projects to build and liven up the town. Spare some extra gold to add a community garden for the locals or build a brand new museum and more\u2026\nFestivals: Join the local community in a Cherry Blossom Festival, annual beach clean up, and many more. There are 2 festivals each season that you can participate in.\nPets: Choose a companion. Decide between a dog, cat, monkey, fox & more! Your pet will play around the farm and come inside the house.\nWeather & Time: The forecast includes sun, wind, rain, storm, and snow. Coral Island also features a day and night cycle with dynamic lighting.  Set the pace by adjusting the passage of time with a time slider.\nCooking: Build a kitchen and start cooking. With over 70 recipes to learn, including Popiah, Lodeh, and Cauliflower Casserole. Gather all cooking utensils and try them all.\nQuests: Embark on adventures! There are elaborate quests that will give you cutscenes and storylines, and there are simple quests. Rack up relationship points and get paid!\n\n\nWelcome to your new home, a small town with big personalities called Starlet Town. It's located on the coast of Coral Island. This tropical island features a setting loosely influenced by Southeast Asia. You'll see this come across the lore, world-building, crops, animals, and more. Nestled in between the equator and northern tropic, Coral Island is graced by four seasons per year.\n\nThis is Coral Island. Segmented into 7 different areas, your farm is located on the left side of the map, just on the outskirts of town.\n Starlet Town is the heart of Coral Island. Not only is it roomy and features a butterfly garden, but this charming little town also has stories hidden behind its townies.\nThe Beach is rich with sparkly white sands, seashells, and seasonal fruits. On the pier sits a handsome old Inn and a gateway to ocean exploration, the Diving spot. \nThe Lake perhaps guards the most magical place in Coral Island. Find your way through the wooden bridge and discover the ancient temple. It\u2019s believed to be the main source of water and where the island's rich soil originates from.\nThe Forest is a mystic sanctuary for wildlife, filled with ruins and who-knows-what. Underneath the musky floor, it's a hoarding place for messages from the past, the Cavern.\nThe Lookout used to be a place where locals prepared for battles of old and whatnot. As time passed, the Lighthouse is now solely used for navigational aid. Come here and enjoy wicked sunsets and pick some wild fruits on your way home.\nThe Woodlands used to be part of the Forest, but since the arrival of humans, it is now tamed and family-friendly, without losing its green allure. Walk alongside the river to see the School, Taco Truck, and houses belong to those who prefer quiet nights over paved pathways of the town.\n Hillside, sandwiched between the Forest and Woodlands, is the perfect combination of green and privacy. Take a peek at the Vineyard and familiarize yourself with the local Carpenters.\n\nThe Coral Three were said to be the Goddess of Flowers, Merfolk, and Giants. Once upon a time, they worked together to maintain the balance of Coral Island. \nThe Goddess of Flowers was worshipped by both Merfolk and Giants. To this day, locals continue to believe that the Goddess is responsible for rejuvenating the island's water, soil, and well-being.\nSubmerged artifacts suggest The Merfolk Kingdom protected the oceans. It appears they were tasked with ruling the underwater world around Coral Island, making sure that order was maintained.\nLegend has it The Kingdom of Giants existed to cultivate the rich soil of Coral Island. Ruins around the island depict Giants, and what appear to be humans, farming alongside one another.\n\nPufferfish Drilling Corp. is a disgraced company whose goal is to drill oil on and around Coral Island. Set to open this Spring, they plan to lobby their way into the community and collect properties to secure voting rights.\n\n\nWe hope to color your days in Coral Island through music.

Please confirm how the add-on money should be assigned then.\n\nThe current plan is to release Coral Island for Steam on the Windows platform first. Since we've passed our Console Stretch Goals, Coral Island will also be coming to Nintendo Switch, Playstation, and Xbox! \n\nWe understand that localization is very important. Coral Island will launch into early access with Bahasa Indonesia and English support. Shortly after, we will update the game to support the additional 8 languages seen below.\nBased in Indonesia, our team currently consists of 20 passionate talents. This includes both permanent crew members and remote collaborators. Although this is our first game as a studio, our team is comprised of veteran and junior game developers.\nYou can learn more about us on our website: www.stairwaygames.com\n\nOur goal is to release the best version of Coral Island. We believe the only way to achieve this is through community involvement. With Kickstarter, we hope to build a community of passionate backers and involve you all in the process of development. All in service of producing the best farming game we can create.  \nSo far, development has been entirely self-funded. Although we have enough funds to complete the game, there are several features we would love to add but don't have the resources to do so. It's always been our dream to play a farming game that features changing seasonal outfits for NPC's, or finally, having kids grow up! We hope Kickstarter helps us realize some of the stretch goals we have for Coral Island.\nAs backers, we invite you to join our Discord to see daily developer diaries and have a direct open line of communication with us. \n\nDevelopment began in October 2019. Initially, we focused on preproduction and coding core features that now serve as the foundation of Coral Island. Over the last 6 months, we've shifted gears into full production.  \nOur focus right now is finalizing and polishing content for the Alpha that will be released to Alpha Farmer tier backers and above. From there, we'll work alongside the community, releasing two content updates and iterating feedback into the game before eventually launching into Steam's early access.\n\n\n\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been working on Coral Island for close to 15 months now. \n\nThe two biggest challenges we see ahead for the project are developing alongside community feedback and, provided we reach the stretch goal, implementing the multiplayer component into the game. \n\nDepending on the amount and type of feedback we receive, the dates for milestones on the development timeline may shift.

My name is Tracy, and I'm the creator of a small business called Atomik Cupcake Designs--I make kawaii accessories such as stickers, jewelry, keychains, and of course, enamel pins! This will be my 5th enamel pin Kickstarter project, and I'm really excited to share it with everyone! To have a look at the finished products of our past work, visit our shop here!\n\nThis collection of designs was actually influenced by my mother (how fitting!), who told me that she thought animal cookies would make great pin designs. It always weirded me out that these delicious cookies came in such obscure shapes, so when designing them, I tried to make them a more recognizable and give them a bit more personality. I also swapped out the traditional camel shape for an alpaca, because why not? =D\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR UK BACKERS:\nDue to new VAT collection laws, I am unfortunately unable to take UK pledges on this Kickstarter, and all UK pledges will be refunded at the end of the campaign. If you are from the UK and want to back these pins, please use these links to pre-order on our Etsy page:\n\n Animal Cookies Pins: https://www.etsy.com/listing/954546775/kawaii-animal-cookies-soft-enamel-pins \n Inflatable Shaker Charm: https://www.etsy.com/listing/954551593/kawaii-animal-inflatable-bag-shaker \n Heart Filler Pins: https://www.etsy.com/listing/940605160/kawaii-heart-shaped-cookie-mini-pin \nLearn more about all of the tasty designs below!\nEach of the four pin designs comes in the two traditional pink and white cookie colors! Because we wanted to dye the metal for these, our designs are soft enamel with an epoxy coating, with sprinkle details printed on top of the epoxy! Each pin measures between 1.5 and 1.75 inches on its longest side. They each have a backstamp of the Atomik Cupcake Designs logo, as well as two backing posts and pink rubber clutches.\n\nThese goodies have been added as stretch goals outside of the main design! All of these extras have been unlocked!\n Freebie rewards are compounded,  so higher tiers will get all of the rewards of the tiers before it! Those who pledged for a shaker charm or heart filler pin/earring set will receive both the glitter and cupcake sticker as freebies!\n\nHow add-ons work: If you'd like to add extra sticker sheets, filler pins, or keychains, just add that additional amount to your pledge. When surveys are sent via Backerkit, you'll have the option of choosing which rewards you pledged for!\n Project Launch: January 12\n Project End: February 5\n Production Begins: Middle/end of February\n Rewards Shipped: mid/late April\nThank you so much for checking out our Kickstarter campaign!

As a result, I have gained valuable experience in understanding not only how to manage a Kickstarter campaign, but about manufacturer standards, quality control, and how much time it really takes for pins to be made.\n\nThere is always the risk of factory mishaps which can delay the progress of a Kickstarter. These can include pins that have the wrong color, a high defect rate that requires a reorder, shipping delays, and other issues that can delay the production of pins. I've done my best to anticipate that sometimes these things happen (especially considering how crazy this year has been due to COVID), and I have set my delivery date accordingly to allow for PLENTY of time to get these all out to you!\n\nBackers will be notified every step of the way on whether we're ahead of schedule, on schedule, or delayed, so there will be no surprises!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nEnamel pins are made of a combination of hard enamel and plated metal.

We think our readers are smart enough to know that we aren't condoning these things, but we also know that in 2020, some people don't want to read about it. So: fair warning.\nThere's also donkey-f*cking.\nFRIED Comics is a proud purveyor of offbeat, irreverent pulp fiction since 2013, and a labor of love for Clay Adams and Alexandre O. Philippe.\nSo far, we have eight successful Kickstarters under our belts. (And between us we have a lot of belts. ) So, we're stoked to return to the scene of the crime.\nClay is the co-writer of RED XMAS, which was released in comic shops this December by Scout Comics, and served as co-editor for the NIGHTMARE THEATER anthology on Kickstarter. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and his latest comic, ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU. When Clay first met Alexandre, he thought, \"My, what a sophisticated European.\" Boy, was he wrong!\nFilm nerd/director Alexandre is the co-writer of RED XMAS from Scout Comics. His most recent documentary is LEAP OF FAITH: WILLIAM FRIEDKIN ON THE EXORCIST, now streaming on Shudder. He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including MEMORY: THE ORIGINS OF ALIEN, 78/52: HITCHCOCK'S SHOWER SCENE, AND THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS. When Alexandre first met Clay, he thought, \"My, what a stupid American.\" Boy, was he right!\nLeila is a comic book artist and writer living in Portland, Oregon. She draws SLEEPLESS, SHUTTER and writes AFAR at Image Comics. Leila has drawn for titles such as THE WICKED + THE DIVINE, SCARLET WITCH, AMERICAN VAMPIRE, and THE PANTHEON PROJECT. In 2015 and 2016, Leila was nominated for the Russ Manning Promising Newcomer Award for her work on SHUTTER. She only took this job because she thought she'd be paid in fries.\nBrett Nienburg is a Denver-based artist who has worked as a concept artist for LEGO and  designed sets for feature films. We're sorry we made him peel so many potatoes. He looks pretty sad about it.\nCharles is from Canada, so we imagine he looks like one of those flappy-headed dudes from South Park.* He has lettered books for Aftershock, Image, IDW and Top Shelf (among others) and is a founding member of Frozen Beach Studios. (*As far as we know, Charles has a normal-looking head.)\nUgh. Just... ugh.\nThe Package\nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nFrieda will replace it free of charge.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe are coming to Kickstarter to put the first two issues into print. The book is 100% complete, our printer is still operating as an essential business, and we are ready to deliver quickly.

My name is Gilles and I am a UK based artist with 9 years of experience in pop culture t-shirt and other merchandise design. I have now dived head first into the world of enamel pins and I am absolutely in love with it.\nKonNYAchiwa!\nThis project features Nya Nya Neko, a group of adorable cat girls. The pin series will see them taking on the personalities and outfits of some very special and popular princesses from our childhood. Inspired by a mixture of vintage dolls and kawaii plush toys, they are cute, eye catching and playful.\nPin Selection *IMPORTANT*\nDifferent characters will be unlocked as more Stretch Goals are reached. You will not have to select your pins until the very end of the Kickstarter Campaign, giving you a larger variety on available enamel pins to choose from.\nYour Contribution\nFunds from this Kickstarter will help to cover the costs of creating a minimum order of each pin as well as the moulds, screen printing elements, glitter features and backing cards. \nAdd-ons and Shipping *IMPORTANT*\nYou will be able to add additional pins, tees, stickers and prints, as well as other exclusive goodies at the end of the campaign when completing your survey.\nThe shipping costs attached to this Kickstarter DO NOT INCLUDE Tracked Shipping, but you will be able to UPGRADE TO TRACKED at the end of the campaign when completing your survey.\nMade of hard enamel in gold plating and approx 45mm to 55mm.\n Glitter features on all pin designs.\n Screen Printing on all pin designs.\n2 Rubber clutches at the back of each pin.\n #GillesPinClub branding on the back of each pin.\nEach pin is attached to an embosed and illustrated backing card.\nThe original Kickstarter goal of \u00a31000 will be covering the costs of the first 3 pins as shown below.\nThe following designs are made available after the project hits certain targets.\nThe goal targets reflect the costs of creating the pin moulds and set up fees, as well as minimum order of each pin. I will be updating the graphic below to show when goals are met.\nUnlike previous campaigns, I will be unlocked groups of pins together once reaching individual targets, starting with \u00a32000, \u00a33000, \u00a34000 and the final group at \u00a35000.\nNo more designs will be created or unlocked through this campaign beyond these designs.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Some of the designs may be subject to small changes during the campaign and in post production.\nBelow you will find the \"Glitter Guide!\" The areas coloured in pink will be glittered for that particular pin.\nThis \"Fairy\" Pin will be available as a FREEBIE for pledges of any 5 pins or more. \nNote: You can also see the prototype for the Nya Nya Neko backing card in the image above, designed to resemble a vintage doll box. \nI have self-funded some samples of the first 4 pins unlocked through this project. Below you can see some of the photos of the sample pins.\nNOTE: As you can see, The Fairy pin comes with very special Stained Glass Wings~! How fantastic does that look?!\nNext you can find some images of previous Nya Nya Neko enamel pins I have manufactured both through Kickstarter as well as my Patreon Pin Club.\nBelow are a series of questions which are frequently asked during my Kickstarter campaigns. I have complied this FAQ to help set your minds at ease about any queries you might have.\nIf your question is not tackled below, please feel free to leave a comment or send me a private message and I will get back to you as soon as possible. \nQ. Will the Villains be added on this set?\nA. Yes, I will be adding a series of Villains that go along with these pins, however they will not be added as part of this campaign. Instead there will be other campaigns to expand this collection. I have made this decision in order to make collecting the full set more affordable, especially in the current financial climate. \nQ. Why are these pins prices a little higher than you usual Kickstarter Pins?\nA. Due to the level of detail in each pin, the ammount of screen prints and the variants available for some of the designs, the Unit Price of each pin is much higher than some of my other designs, and therefore had to up the price slightly. However, the Early Bird prices still reflect the same discounts from previous campaigns.\nQ. Can I add more items (stickers, pins, t shirts) to my current pledge? \nA. Yes, you will be able to purchase addons ontop of your pledge rewards at the end of the campaign while filling in your surveys.\nQ. Should I add more money to my reward to purchase addons.\nA. No, please do not add extra money to contribute to your addons. Addons will be purchased and paid for at the end of the campaign separately to your pledges here on Kickstarter, using BackerKit.\nQ. BackerKit surveys never make it to my inbox. How will I get my survey?\nA. If your survey does not arrive once I send out the update here on Kickstarter notifying everyone that surveys have been sent, simply send me a private message here on Kickstarter or by email and I will link you directly to your survey. No surveys shall be lost here!\nQ. I don't have any funds to contribute to your Kickstarter Campaign but I'd love to help. How can I do this?\nA. Sharing a Kickstarter with your friends is the easiest and most efficient way to help any campaign. Thank you in advance to all those who share the link to this and all my other Kickstarters~!\nQ. Will my Reward come with Tracked Shipping?\nA. To keep the rewards at a low price point, Tracked Shipping is not applied automatically to each reward. Instead you can purchased tracked shipping for your parcel as an addon upon completing your survey.\nQ. My parcel has not arrived yet but I didn't purchase the Tracked Shipping. Can you help me?\nA. Unfortunately if you chose not to purchase Tracked Shipping, I am unable to determine if you parcel was delivered and where. The best I can do is confirm it was shipped to the correct address. So please do purchase the Tracked Shipping Addon if you would like to ensure extra safety to your parcel.\nI would like to take a moment to thank you for reading and supporting this Kickstarter campaign. I am so excited for you to receive your pins.\nFor the latest news about this Kickstarter as well as other projects, please feel free to follow me on Instagram at @GillesBone, Twitter at @GillesBone and on my Facebook Page GBIllustrations.\nKickstarter launches on January 28th and runs for 25 days.\nThe Kickstarter campaign will end on February 22nd.\nKickstarter Funds will be received after about 15 - 17 days.\nBackerkit surveys are sent for your pin selection, add-on purchases and mailing address info once the Kickstarter Funds are recieved.\nProduction will approximately take between 2 to 4 months due to the volume of designs. The duration may vary  due to the global pandemic. \nIt will take about 1 to 2 weeks for the pins to be shipped to me.\nI will package and send out your orders as soon as the pins arrive to my home.\nYou can expect to receive your pins no later than Mid July 2021. Please make sure that your address is correct to prevent any unnecessary delays. If there are any setbacks in the production process, I will keep you posted.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome pins may vary ever-so-slightly from the mockups above during production, however such changes will be minor and few and far between.\n\nThere is also always the possibility of delays in production and shipping time, however I will be in close contact with the manufacturer throughout the entire process to make sure they are keeping with the timeline mentioned above.\n\nI will be personally examining each pin before dispatch to make sure that no one receives any blemished or defective pins.\n\nPlease make sure that you double check that your address is correct to make sure that you package does not get lost.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "\u2605 One Pin \u2605", "descp": "Choose 1 pin from the collection, including any pins whose stretch goals have been met.

We love the entire culture that surrounds them including the other media that they populate and have become popular in. We love the heroes and the villains, the bold and the subtle. We love how many different types of stories can be told and the many different genres and sub-genres that they can encompass.\nComic Books are unlike any other medium. They combine the beautiful imagery of art with the emotional and dramatic phrasing of prose or screenplay into this unparalleled art form that transcends time and class.   \nWe love being whisked away into fantastic and strange worlds filled with colorful characters and dynamic sequences of action, drama, horror and comedy. We enjoy being engrossed in an intricate murder mystery with the clues hidden in panels, or captivated by rich fantasy worlds full of creatures and races we've never seen before, or even entertained by alternate versions of our own world where people fly or become invisible, or can read minds!\nComic Books are our passion, and so we talk about them.

Make/100"}}, {"backer": "Lisa Moore", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\"Blue\" is about being happy being you!\n\n\"Blue\" is a children's book that explores, through the prism of colors both common and unusual, what it might be like to be someone else and, ultimately being happy with who you are. It's a story about self-esteem. Being happy with the skin you are in. And that is a lesson that is becoming more and more important to teach to children even at the earliest stages of their lives. \nAfter reading story after story of children who were starving themselves to emulate their favorite pop star or the latest supermodel of the minute or who were begging their parents for plastic surgery before their age even reached double digits, I knew something was very wrong. And while I've never exactly been in love with the way I look, I have long since come to terms with it and found things about myself that I do love. So, I felt that it was important for children to see that there were a lot of good things about themselves that they can love, too.  So, I wrote the original poem about Blue. Which, with the artistic talents of Rodney Fyke of Hazzum Productions, has become the book that we hope to create through your kind and generous pledges. \nBlue Cover Art by Rodney Fyke\nBlue Contemplates Colors\nFallow? Zomp?\nBlue Talks to Old Grey\nThe Wisdom of Age\nAnger and Apathy\nRewards\nIn addition to the 30 pages \"Blue\" book signed by the author,  and the bookmark that reads \"I'm never \"Blue\" when I have a book to read\", I have commissioned four incredible prints based on the Blue character from four of today's most talented artists. They are Comfort Love and Adam Withers,  independent comics megastars and creators of the uber-popular \"Uniques\" and \"Rainbow in the Dark\", Chandra \"Spookychan\" Free, eclectic and amazingly talented artist and colorist for companies including Archaia Entertainment, Ape Entertainment, Image Comics, and creator of \"The God Machine\" and \"Machina Corpse.\", Sean Forney, the endlessly prolific print, cover and card illustrator and creator of the Scarlet Huntress, and Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan, independent graphic designer and illustrator with a nearly boundless imagination. At the two highest tiers, $100 and $200, backers will receive a personalized poem, written by me, featuring the person of their choice and Blue. And finally, the $200 tier features the one of a kind, original artboard from the print created by Comfort Love and Adam Withers.\n\nPrint Sketch from Rewards contributing artist Chandra Free\nPossible Print Process Sketch from Rewards Contributing Artist Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan\nMore Possible Print Process Sketches from Rewards Contributing Artist Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan\nSean Forney's \"Blue\" Print\nComfort Love and Adam Withers' \"Blue\" Print\n\"Spider-Blue\" original art by Rodney Fyke\nTARDIS original art by Rodney Fyke\nChandra Free Print\nJeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O'Ryan Print\nIron-Blue original art by Rodney Fyke\n\"Blue and the Ghost\" by Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O' Ryan\n\"Blue and the Ghost-Rainbow Edition\" by Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O' Ryan\nWho are we?\nI am John Wilson and the author of \"Blue\". I was an Art teacher in an inner-city school for 11 years until a variety of medical issues and chronic pain forced me to give up my career. Since that time, I became a comic journalist for websites including Comic Related, Complete Set, and CBR and wrote two comic books for Last Ember Press, \"Pneumatic Cases\" and two of the three stories in \"Fireside Tales\": \"Charmageddon\" and \"EEK! Lil' Monsters!\". \"Blue\" will be the first book created under the banner of my own publishing company, The Monkeywerx Publishing Company. \n\n\"Blue\" artist Rodney Fyke is a writer and artist from Cincinnati, Ohio. He's been working on and off in Independent comics since the early 90s. His art style varies from high detailed illustrations to cartoony drawings. His published projects include Superior Seven, Peanut, Puddin\u2019 n\u2019 Jelly, Pitter Patter, Unchained, and Roadkill Rampage. He has over twelve comics that have been published in which he's either written, illustrated or both. You can see more of his work at www.hazzum.com \n\nPledges \nThe lion's share of the money request, 3/4 or it will go to our first initial planned print run of \"Blue\", which is 100 copies. if demand and pledges exceed that, we will be able to print more to meet that demand. The remaining 1/3 of the requested funds will go to shipping the products, pay for promotional material like the bookmarks and flyers and, in part, pay the commissions of the talented artists that are providing the incredible prints that are available throughout this Kickstarter. \n\nWhere Your Pledges Go\nShipping\nA note on shipping: shipping is one of the most difficult to price and predict. We are genuinely committed to bringing you a quality package that is shipped securely. We will be using the best \"media shipping\" envelopes designed to ship books and prints. We have tried to keep costs low but international shipping and domestic shipping rates continue to rise. if you have any questions about specific shipping arrangements, feel free to contact us through the community section of this page. \n\nStretch Goals\nGoal 1: If we exceed our originally stated goal of $750 and are able to achieve $1000, everyone who pledged at the $15 level or higher (ie purchased a physical copy of \"Blue\") will receive a print by artist and designer Jeremy \"Skare Kro\" O'Ryan. \nGoal 2:  If we exceed our originally stated goal of $750 and are able to achieve $1500, everyone who pledged at the $15 level or higher (ie purchased a physical copy of \"Blue\") will receive a print by \"The God Machine\" creator and artist Chandra Free. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of our key challenges is not being embraced by parents, children, and the children's book community at large. This is my first children's book and may not follow the \"normal\" format. It also may not fall within a particular genre or age range. That may be a problem in getting acceptance and donations from more than just friends.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter and while its success or failure will not mean that \"Blue\" will never see the light of day, it does mean that it will be delayed significantly longer as I save the funds to self-publish on my own.\n\nAs mentioned, this is my Kickstarter. It's impossible for me to know if it will be embraced or ignored until it happens and where I made mistakes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "$1 \"Who's Blue?\" Tier", "descp": "Pledgers at this level will receive the eternal thanks of all of us here at The Monkeywerx and you may tell everyone you meet today that you did a good thing for the color \"Blue\" today.\nINCLUDES:\nFeelings both warm and fuzzy!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "$5 \"Electric Blue\" Tier", "descp": "Pledgers at this level will receive a digital copy of \"Blue.\" A valid e-mail address must be provided to ensure delivery.\nINCLUDES:\nA digital copy of the \"Blue\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "$15-\"I'm so Blue\" Tier", "descp": "Pledgers at this level will receive a copy of \"Blue\", signed by the author, and a bookmark\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (44 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "$25 \"Different Shades of Blue\" A Tier", "descp": "These unique tiers provide backers with the choice of two options:\n\nOn Tier A: Backers will receive a signed copy of \"Blue\", a bookmark, and the 5\" x 7\" print by independent superstar artist Sean Forney!\nINCLUDES:\nA: Signed copy of \"Blue\", Bookmark, 5 X 7 Print by Sean Forney\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (46 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "$25 \"Different Hues of Blue\" B Tier", "descp": "These unique tiers provide backers with the choice of two options:\n\nOn Tier B: Backers will receive a signed copy of \"Blue, a bookmark, and the 5\" x 7\" print by artist couple and \"Uniques\" and Rainbow in the Dark\" creators Comfort Love and Adam Withers!\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\n5 X 7 Print from artists Comfort Love and Adam Withers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "$35 \"Blue Eyes Smiling at Me\" Tier", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive a copy of \"Blue\", signed by the author, a bookmark, and 5\" x 7\" prints from both superstar independent artist Sean Forney and \"Uniques\" and \"Rainbow in the Dark\" creators Comfort Love and Adam Withers!\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\n5x7 Print from artist Sean Forney\n5 X 7 Print from artists Comfort Love and Adam Withers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "$35 \"Blue Bundle\" Tier", "descp": "Backers at this tier will receive a signed copy of \"Blue\", a bookmark, the 5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost\" print, and the 5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost-Rainbow Edition\" print from independent artist and graphic designer Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O' Ryan.\nINCLUDES:\nCopy of \"Blue\", signed by the Author\n\"Blue\" Bookmark\n5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost\" print by Jeremy \"Skare-Kro\" O'Ryan\n5\" x 7\" \"Blue and the Ghost-Rainbow Edition\" print by \"Skare-Kro\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers", "Limited (48 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "$100 \"I'm Blue!

Whether it\u02bbs sitting with our loved ones at family gatherings, or sitting in the classroom listening to a teacher attempting to convince us of the relevance of historical figures. Stories keep culture and people alive, often providing a timeless link to our ancient traditions, myths, legends, hopes, and dreams. Stories also help us understand ourselves and the world around us. \nBUT.... what happens if the stories that we\u02bbre told exclude us?  \nA single story, a single ruling perspective creates stereotypes and perceptions that anything else is not important. When that one story becomes the only story, people start to question their existence and humanity. It is disempowering to anyone who does not fit the ruling stereotype. The problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story that matters.\nThe Moana Nui podcast is a safe haven for authentic storytelling and a space where humans from all walks of life can engage in thoughtful conversations.

We celebrate and empower the silenced voices of our ancestors and their accomplishments, while inspiring their descendants who keep their legacies alive.\nEvery culture has its own stories or narratives, which are shared as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation or instilling moral values.\nStorytelling forges connections between people and ideas. Stories convey the culture, history, and values that unite people. Stories build familiarity and help all of us to step into the shoes of another person and see things from their point of view. \n\nThe Moana Nui Podcast will be hosted by writer/creator/designer Moana McAdams and will make its home on Podbean with extended availablility on Apple Podcast, Spotify, and Google.\nMoana McAdams, Host\nPodbean Hosting Fees\nEditing Services\nShipping Costs\nReward Production\nOfficial Moana Nui USB\nKids Club tier - $50\nLock-In Your Special Guest Appearance on Season 2\n16 x 30 Canvas Art - $89\nWe\u02bbll Come Up With Questions Together & Have Some Fun!\nPersonalized Consulting with Moana\nOfficial Moana Nui Hoodie\nOfficial Moana Nui Mask\nAllen Carter is an artist, writer, promoter, and the sole creator of two independent comics titles called Damn Tourists and Cosmic Force.

Any change they cause could destroy history as we know it.\n\nA group of time traveling soldiers stands against them. They call themselves The Toxic Fruit.\nTheir battle has been waged for many years, but they've never faced anything like this: \nWhat are We Making?\nThe funds raised from this Kickstarter campaign will be used to print both the 11th and 12th issue of our fantasy comic series Tart. \nIn Tart 11, the two newest recruits are taken on one last training mission before they join the fight. Their task: infiltrate Nazi Germany during the 1936 Berlin Olympics.\nTart 11\nPlease note: Due to the setting, images associated with the Third Reich will be seen in this issue prominently. We are making the choice not to share them in this campaign, but do not want any backers to be surprised when they receive their books.\n\nIn Tart 12, the entire Toxic Fruit Organization must band together to try to repel The son of the King of Hell. \nTart 12\nA total of 52 brand new pages of Time traveling, demon hunting adventure.\nTwo new issues delivered together to maximize shipping costs.\nAn issue of stealth, followed by an issue of all out war.\nA brand new Enamel Pin starring the First Lady of The Toxic Universe: \nTart Acid!\n\nHow can I Catch Up?\nIf you are just learning about Tart, please don't be worried about being late to the party. Our previous backers have always supported us so passionately that we were able to print enough first edition copies of our comics that we have a bundle for you.\n\nThe Catch Up Tier includes the Tart Volume 1 trade paperback (collecting issues 1-3), and individual issues of Tart 4-12. \n\nIf you've been waiting to catch up on Tart, don't wait much longer. We are starting to run low on some of our first editions copies of Tart and can not promise we'll be able to offer this in the future.\n\nWant to know more about our series before you pledge?

IF YOU LOVE IT, BACK IT!!! \nWhat Our Peers Say about Tart\nWho Makes Tart?\nWhy are we Returning to Kickstarter?\nOur series has found our most passionate and supportive audience here on Kickstarter. It is not an exaggeration to say that we might not have been able to continue if not for those readers who found us and return again and again.\n\nWe want to continue giving that audience \"first dibs\" at our comics to repay that support. It has been asked of us if any other series has been on the platform longer than Tart, and we honestly don't know. But we are proud to have gotten ten issues into the world with the Kickstarter Community. We're going to be thrilled to hit an even dozen when this campaign is funded.\n\nAs always with our campaigns, this project is 100% ready to go. We never launch Kickstarters without all interior art completed, because delivering on-time is extremely important to us.\n\nThe funds raised in this campaign will go directly to printing enough issues of Tart 11 and 12 to fulfill this campaign and have issues left over for the convention circuit (when that resumes), create the Tart Acid Enamel Pin, and pay for shipping those rewards to our backers.\n\nAny additional funds raised will go toward the interior artwork of Tart 13 which is already underway.\n\nReward Tiers \n\nThank You!

The book was created and edited by Cloudscape board member, Emily Lampson and features heartwarming stories of life, love, and food, all of which connects the stories characters when they enter Mina's.  Some contributors have brought their own experiences to the book and others were inspired about moments throughout the history of Vancouver.  This book features ethnic diversity and represents all walks of life including individuals old and young, LGBTQ and people with disabilities throughout the history of the city we all love. \nCover art by Carolyn Wong\nThe anthology starts with Emily Lampson's story about the diner's opening in 1919, coinciding with British Columbian legislation passed which forbade white waitresses from working at Chinese businesses. Liz, a waitress, loses her job due to this law and goes to work at her sister Laura's restaurant, which is named after Liz's daughter Mina.\n\nWelcome to Mina's by Emily Lampson\n\nWelcome to Mina's contains happy stories and tragic ones taking place at the diner throughout the years.  From a delivery man finding forbidden love to curious people passing through on a much longer journey, Mina's is the destination to meet new friends. \n\nEmily's motivation for assembling Welcome to Mina's is to nurture the creation of more stories that take place in the City of Vancouver. The film industry regularly use Vancouver as a backdrop pretending to be other places, but not often does the city ever play itself. Our city is full of talented writers and artists working in comics, animation, film, video games, prose, and music, but the city itself is not always reflected in the work that we produce. Vancouver is a special place and we're so excited to share with you the lives of Vancouverites in these stories. \nCaught in the Storm by Evan Waterman and Lo Vicente\nWelcome to Mina's is edited and curated by Emily Lampson.\nA combined effort from talented writers and artists have created a 135 page book of wonderful black and white, grey-scale comics. \n\nThis beautiful cover is drawn by Seeroro - Carolyn Wong with stories written and drawn by\nEmily Lampson\nDr. Ray Hsu \n Jonathon Dalton \nArthur Protasio\nVictor Moura\nJohn Burwood\nAmy Fox\nWren Handman\nSabrina Symington\nDino Caruso\nHaley Boros\nJean Kindratsky\nAli Lupu\nEvan Waterman\nLo Vicente\nOliver McTavish-Wisden\nMatthew Nielsen\nMann Chalermwat\nKelly Chen \"Scarlet wings Kaili\"\nJeffrey Ellis\nJohn Ward\nLawrence Denvir\nTamiko Masters\nBlessings in Disguise by Arthur Protasio and Victor Moura\n\n\n$10,000 is our goal, although the cost to make this book is about $5,500 more than that, which Cloudscape has put up up front from revenue from past books.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit. We couldn't be happier to share it with you.\nWhat Exactly Is This Kickstarter For?\nThe team has already invested tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of man-hours into the development of this first WAILING BLADE series.\nThe WAILING BLADE COLLECTION issue is 100% complete and ready to print.\nWith your support here on Kickstarter, we can truly create the most incredible foil-enhanced, die-cut hardcover edition possible, while also offering some more affordable softcover and digital editions so all fans of hard-hitting dark sci-fi comics can TAKE THE BLADE! \nCHECK OUT THESE INCREDIBLE REWARDS!\nADD-ONS\n Want to customize your pledge and add a few more goodies?\n\nProject Budget\nYour support on Kickstarter will help us cover the large cost of printing and shipping thousands of books around the globe.\nWAILING BLADE PROJECT TIMELINE\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: Oct 20 - Nov 20\nKickstarter Funds Received: Dec 4\nWailing Blade Vol 1 to Print: Early December\nMerchandise in Production: December \nBook Manufacturing and Freight: (December/January)\nExtra Buffer Time for Unexpected Issues: (Late January)\nExpected Deliver to US Backers: (Mid February)\nExpected Deliver for INT Backers: (March)\nBACK WITH CONFIDENCE, BECAUSE COMIXTRIBE ALWAYS DELIVERS! \nWe've built our comics business by always delivering for thousands of backers like you. \nThis launch will be no different, as we look forward to serving long-time fans and first-time readers alike!\nTHIS BLADE IS SHARP, SO HERE'S HOW WE'LL PROTECT IT IN TRANSIT!\nAs Kickstarter fans and collector's ourselves, we know there's nothing worse than backing a comic project and then having your rewards arrive damaged.\nAfter consulting with our backers, we've revamped our shipping practices to ensure your comics and collectibles arrive in great condition.\nAll books shipped will be secured in Gemini Comic Supply Comic Flash Mailers, which provides impact-resistant protection.\nOrders with multiple comics will be sandwich packed and secured for additional protection.\nAnd our Wailing Boxes will be BUBBLE WRAPPED before being inserted into a second shipping box, so that it arrives in great condition.\nThank you so much for taking the time to check out our project.

This time, our young heroes face off against spiders. Lots and lots of spiders!\nIn \"The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs,\" Maeve is dreadfully scared of spiders. But when her younger brother is captured by the evil exterminator and his clutter of arachnids, she must overcome her fear to save him...and the world.\nWhat Do You Get?\nOur comics blend everything you love about Goosebumps, Scooby-Doo, and Tales From the Crypt. House of Fear was created as a way to introduce kids to scary stories, but our comics are great for anyone who likes fun, exciting fantasy-adventure comics. \nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nA complete, stand-alone, 32-page comic.\nA story suitable for all ages.\nOff-set printing for highest quality.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nI'm confident you and your family will enjoy our comics. So confident, in fact, we guarantee your satisfaction.  \nIf you back the printed version and dislike the comics for any reason, return them for a refund (minus shipping fees).\nAnd these comics are already printed, so back with 100% confidence. Check out the limited edition matte covers. The matte cover with the shiny logo looks fantastic.\nThe matte covers have spot gloss on the title. They look incredible. And the cover stock is a little thicker, too, which is a nice bonus for collectors and children.\nWhat Critics Are Saying  \nIn 2019, Dark Horse Comics published a collection of House of Fear stories. \nWhen the book hit shops, we received good feedback from readers and critics. Here's what they were saying about it online... \nPreview Pages\nEnjoy this preview of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs. \nWhy Quickstarter?\nNot long after our last campaign, the House of Fear team created \"The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\" We had the Kickstarter page nearly complete, but the timing didn't quit work out. And then, when Covid hit, comics were moved to the back burner for awhile.\nDespite having already printed the rewards, we held off on launching until we made progress on future comics. Our goal for this short campaign is to reintroduce the series to readers, and get a jump start on creating more issues in 2021.\nThe Rewards   \nReceive a PDF version of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\nReceive a print copy of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs.\nGet two copies of House of Fear: The Infestation of Mr. Skinny Legs. Perfect for collectors or those with 2-child households.\nGet a signed and numbered copy of the 100-page novella, Santa's Claws. Also receive the rare orange matte variant of Mr. Skinny Legs, plus the limited edition green matte cover, too.\nHave your pitch or Kickstarter page reviewed by a professional editor! This reward includes a thorough edit and review, plus a Zoom session to discuss the feedback. Plus all of the print and digital rewards.\nHave your 22-page comic script edited by a professional editor! Includes a substantive edit of your script, with detailed written comments, plus a Zoom session to discuss the feedback. Also includes the print and digital rewards.\nIs your son or daughter an artist? If so, they can design the monster for an upcoming issue of House of Fear. Includes a family Zoom session to discuss the project, plus email updates for each step in the comic-creation process. Includes the Mr. Skinny Legs print and digital rewards.\nIs you son or daughter interested in making comics? With this reward, they can be a part of the entire process. Includes a family Zoom session to discuss ideas, plot, and characters for the comic, plus regular email updates for each step in the process. Also includes all Mr. Skinny Legs print and digital rewards.\nBlack Friday Deals\nI've added two Black Friday reward tiers that feature the House of Fear Dark Horse collected edition. I have limited quantities, so if you're looking for a signed copy of the Dark Horse book, act now.\nReceived a signed copy of the House of Fear Dark Horse collected edition, plus two copies of the standard Mr. Skinny Legs (and the digital rewards, too).\nReceived a signed copy of the House of Fear Dark Horse collected edition, plus the limited orange matte cover, and the green matte cover (plus the digital rewards).\nMilestone Bonus\nWhen the campaign reaches 100 backers, every backer will also receive a look behind the scenes. Call it a director's cut, a digital-deluxe version, or a making-of supplement, but this book will be more than just a script book. More than just a handful of sketches and inked pages, too.\nFor this digital book, I've pulled together all the resources I have from when we made the comic, including the various stages of the script, art changes and the discussions about them, character descriptions, sample colors, and so much more. \nAdd Ons  \nAfter you select a reward tier, Kickstarter will ask if you'd like to add any other rewards. If you backed a physical reward level, you can add one or more of these House of Fear comics.\nWhere do the Funds Go?\nBecause the rewards are already printed and ready to go, the bulk of the funding will be used for shipping, packaging costs, and Kickstarter fees. All remaining money will help us fund the creation of future issues of House of Fear.\nWhat About Shipping?\nAll comics are individually bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). These will be shipped via First Class Mail. \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. These packages will be shipped via Priority Mail. \nMeet the Creators\nWill You Help Us Make More Comics?\nIt's simple: We want to make more fun, exciting comics and get them to as many readers as we possibly can. And we can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. I hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making action-packed comics for kids of all ages.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done everything we can to minimize risk for backers: All of the rewards are printed, the comics are already bagged and boarded, and I've secured the necessary shipping supplies. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and this is our fourth House of Fear campaign.

Aneksi has lived as a ghost for centuries and has learned to rejoin the world of the living.  She is at the cusp of finding purpose in her unlife in the modern world of the living.  She is, however, bound by an ancient curse to a demon named Sabanion.  As Aneksi pushes more into the world of the living, she must drag Sabanion with her.  \nIssue #2 continues the story of Spectress and her demon partner, Sabanion, and their bloody escape from Containment Facility-4.  They go up against the Moon Crew, the wardens of CONFAC-4, and the Exorcists, priests that wield the unknown power of The Sacred Forlorn.\n \nThere's nothing quite like Spectress & Sabanion, but if you enjoy fast pacing, tension, mystery and the macabre (Hellraiser, Immortal Hulk, Justice League Dark, the works of Cullen Bunn) this is the book for you!\nA unique story incorporating ghosts, Egyptian mythology, magic, demons, Delta Force operators, exorcists and more.\n24 interior pages of intense, full-color art.\nInside paper is glossy 70 lb text.

Not a u-rah-rah but from a closer, more personal perspective that doesn't come through in movies or pop culture.\n\nKickstarter is an amazing platform where I hope to reach a larger audience.  I want more people to enjoy this gritty escape into a world of magic, murk, victory and tragedy.   Covid-19 has halted the convention schedule this year, I want to offer comic book fans that independent creator experience.\n\n             The funds we raise through this campaign will be used to pay for the printing and shipping of the book, as well as cover Kickstarter fees and some art costs.

Now, she is... The Last Ember!\nA hooded figure watches her every move from the shadows, while a serial killer hunts beings of power like Ember, slowly making his way to her.\n\nPreviously, Ember had trouble dealing with her new abilities, and accidentally set a few things on fire. Not to mention having a run-in with a school bully, alienating her friends, and being watched by a mysterious hooded figure. \nIn the epilogue, we learned of the man hunting down people like Ember as his quest brings him closer and closer to her doorstep.\nIn \"Hunted,\" Ember tries to rise above recent troubles and get back to some semblance of normalcy, but Tiana, her new nemesis, isn't quite done with Ember just yet. She and her minions set out to make life a living Hell for Ember.\nElsewhere, the hooded figure meets with Quincy, a new player on the board as they make some startling discoveries and run into some trouble of their own!\n\"Hunted\" #1 is the first chapter in a bold new direction for The Last Ember, and is a great jumping on point!\nInterview on KICKSTART THE WEEK\nwith NICOLE D'ANDRIA\nWe've now unlocked ALL our Milestone Bonuses!\nA digital copy of TART Vol. 1 has already been sent to all backers! \nYou'll be getting a print of Ember by Mike Watson of Freestyle Komics and Short Fuse Media digitally or physically!

He has also been lettering comics for the better part of two decades, with work published through Image Comics, Action Lab Entertainment, Arcana, Moonstone, AC Comics and more. Celestial Falcon is his first foray into full-on co-writing a project.\nFederico lives in Rome and works as a Comic Artist for Sergio Bonelli Editore, Aspen Comics, Noise Press, Blackbox Comics, Ink Forged Studios, Last Ember Press & Remer Comics and likes drawing everything especially American Superheroes.\nHi there, my name is Andrea Celestini and I'm a comic book colorist. I work for American indie publishers since 2008. I also color erotic graphic novels for the French market. I worked for Evoluzione publishing, Action Lab Entertainment, Monkeybrain Comics, Splotch Comics, Outpost 426, BlackBox Comics, Tabou Editions just to name a few. If there's action, super heroes, monsters, explosions or pretty girls, I'm the one you are looking for.\nNicole is the creator/writer of Road Trip to Hell, her first creator-owned project! She's a passionate comic book collector who has worked for Action Lab Entertainment as marketing director, submissions editor and a script editor. She has also worked on several of their adaptations, including Peter David's Artful and on the Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir comics. She helped write an issue of their ongoing DollFace series. She's also an accomplished freelance editor. Learn more at ComicMaven.com.\n\nThe funds we raise in this campaign will help pay for the remaining art and colors, as well as printing costs. Anything extra we are fortunate to raise will be poured back into the project for future issues.\nThis platform has, time and again, proven to be a phenomenal community for independent comics, and one we've had great success on. \nCollectively, Last Ember Press has successfully funded 8 previous projects:\nFor this book, we've brought in the top notch art team of Federico Sabbatini and Andrea Celestini that are taking this series to the next level. Add to that the experience of editor Nicole D'Andria, and the time and money we've put into the issue already, and we feel we have a product worthy of the fantastic backers here on Kickstarter!\nWe've also commissioned this gorgeous variant cover by Francesco Tomaselli (Heavy Metal), and there are more surprises to come during the campaign!\nThis book is a passion project for me, and is the flagship title of our company. Ember is a character that was literally birthed from the creation of this company and has become very near and dear to my heart, and important to the brand that we are building. This is why we continue to step up our game with each new issue.\nThe Last Ember is also the kind of book I love to read. Mystery, action, drama, magic and fantasy elements, and a touch of romance. It's got it all!\n\nCheck out this stunning preview of The Last Ember: Hunted #1 with beautiful line art by Federico Sabbatini and gorgeous colors by Andrea Celestini!\nLeft to Right: Danny, Tiana, Kendall, Ember, Gaby (in order of height).\n\nHelp us make sure even more people know about this campaign and learn about The Last Ember: Hunted!

Murder! Mystery!\n In an alternate 1920s, a clueless girl and a man-about-town team up to dive into New York's underground world of rum runners and black market magic.\nIn an alternate 1920s, America's 18th Amendment outlaws both alcohol and spellcraft--the technology once used to power modern American lives. While the Practical Scientists have stepped in with their new technology, Arcanists won't go down without a fight, and continue to trade spellcraft and crafting materials to keep the art alive.\nThe 18th Amendment and the Practical Scientists of America\nIn this double-length issue, the irreverent Chester Radison gets Emily involved in an underground spell-dueling club run by his bookie Mikey Hernandez. Our rag tag pair will have to contend with the seductive spell slinger Sherry Blair, and may even run into her husband, Connor Blair--who happens to be  a Practical gangster. And if Emily can survive all that, luncheon with her sister's fianc\u00e9 might be a piece of cake.\nBlack Ball Issue 3 is the next exciting installment in the world of Arcanists vs. Praticals, spell running, moonshining mystery and adventure!\nManga-sized, double-length issue: over 60 pages of half-seas hootnanny adventures with Emily, Chester, and a colorful cast of characters\nBeautiful hand-colored, palette shifting art work -- you never know what you'll see next on each page as the colors and tones help tell the tale\nOver 30 pages have NEVER BEEN PUBLISHED on any platform. This will be the first time over half this book is ever seen!\nHello! I'm Melissa J Massey, creator of fine fantasy comics like The Alchemist of Aurillia, a fantasy adventure in the Ottoman Empire, and Vatican Assassins, a tale of the Vatican's demon hunting militia. I'm best known for creating lovable and emotive characters and drawing epic architecture. As I always say: when in doubt, slap a cathedral on it.\nBlack Ball is my ongoing webcomic series, publishing online since 2018.\nI've been published in anthologies from Wannabe Press, Arcane Inkdustries, and Kara Love.\nBlack Ball is many things for me: a challenge to write a concise story; a fun exploration of historical fantasy; and a deconstruction of typical 1920s literature. But as I have written and drawn the story, it has evolved into something much bigger as I look at the characters and the effects of removing a technology that people rely on. So you may find some themes developing in this issue in particular that feel a little familiar.\n\nHere's what people say about Black Ball\n\"This thing crackles like a 20's comedy, albeit with sound and color (which just makes it even better). You've really taken it up a couple notches artwise, since your triumphant return, mj. \" - Charlie Wise, Groovy Kinda\n\n\"I've been loving the limited color palettes you've been using for prior pages and enjoying when you break that for emphasis, but I have to say, this page is my favorite so far- the colors are just gorgeous, and the reveal is beautiful! The hot pinks with the electric blue are so vibrant and really give this page great energy!\" -Nattosoup\nAs a history nerd, there's lots of time periods that I love. But fantasy stories haven't yet taken advantage of them all.\nOne day while chatting in a comic creators group online, the topic of different fantasy setting came up, and I thought of the 1920s as being a perfect setting. The gears started spinning, and I began putting together a tale of magic, murder, and mystery...thus, Black Ball was born.\nThe best part of making Black Ball is just how much fun it is. Emily embodies a lot of how I felt about myself in High School. Putting her up against Chester, her total opposite, has resulted in some of my best writing and art yet, and it has been a joy to create their adventure through New York's underground together.  At the end of the day, that's why I make comics - to have fun, and to share that fun with others. \nAnd also to deliver crushing blows every so often...they don't call me a purveyor of fine fantasy comics and tragic shenanigans for nothing!\nMost of the project funding will go towards printing books, ordering the extra products, and covering those shipping costs.\n\n\n\nLooking for more? The first 90+ pages  of Black Ball are available online to read for free.\n BRAND NEW REWARD TIERS! Original Art at Black Friday prices!!!\n\nBeing a solo creator is a real challenge, but thankfully I have the support of great fans like you that help me bring these projects to life.\nWith you, we can make Black Ball issue 3 a reality, continuing into the meat of the story from Issues 1 and 2. I hope you come along for the ride. It's gonna be a blast.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third time running a Kickstarter and last time around was a very smooth campaign.

That doom, almost single-handedly, was brought by General Almond and his army of Nutcrackers who were determined to take over the Planet and steal its resources.\nIssue Two continues this epic story while adding more characters and obstacles! You will meet new characters like the ominous Jack Frost, the evil Caesar Dimitrius, and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future among others!\nIssue Two will be a 30-page comic book written by Ryan Haack, featuring interior art by Rafael Sam. The comic book will also include a five-page back-up story with art by Tom Barton. \nBRIC-A-BRAC #2 Interiors, Rafael Sam\nBRIC-A-BRAC #2 Interiors, Rafael Sam\nPage 1, The Tragedy of Jack Frost\nPage 3, The Tragedy of Jack Frost\nExclusive Jack Frost Print\nTHE CREATORS\nWRITER/CREATOR - RYAN HAACK\nMy name is RYAN HAACK and I'm the creator and writer of BRIC-A-BRAC! Since I was a little kid, I was fascinated by Christmas and all the lore surrounding it! I loved the imagery, the decorations, the holiday specials, and I still do to this day! BRIC-A-BRAC is my attempt at creating a story that can show adults and children how valuable and important Christmas is as a concept! It's an incredibly useful holiday with ideals and values which we can implement every single day of our lives! I am so passionate about this story and had an absolute BLAST writing in the dramatic, fun, and always exciting world that is BRIC-A-BRAC! I am the host of the FAR-FETCHED STORYTELLING PODCAST and the creator of the web-comic the UNSPEAKABLE TEXT, too!\nMe circa 2002\nINTERIOR ARTIST/CHARACTER DESIGNER - RAFAEL SAM\nBorn in S\u00e3o Paulo, and raised in Recife (PE), Rafael Sam has worked as a freelance illustrator and comic artist for 9 years. He has worked in the area of textbooks and also comic books, in cartoon style, concept art, and has made scenes for animations. Some time ago, he worked for DreamWorks Animation's comics division, where he made 3 editions of the Madagascar title. He recently worked on the catharsis-funded Black Desert author project where he made the official launch at ccxp 2018. His Instagram is @rafael1234hc. \nCOVER ARTIST/BACK-UP STORY ARTIST - TOM BARTON\nTom\u2019s been working as an illustrator for the last 5 years. He\u2019s done several comics, including a short webcomic series for League of Legends called \u201cOlaf Vs Everything\u201d. His biggest influences are the likes of Joe Madureira, Chris Bachalo, and Ed McGuinness. When he\u2019s not working on comics, he\u2019s coming up with character designs, concept art, and writing his own stories. His Instagram is @tomo_tron.\nPage 2, The Tragedy of Jack Frost\nFAN ART FOR BRIC-A-BRAC #2! \nChristmas Money by The Howl Comics\nGeneral Almond by @ZachDB\nGarret by Milton Aguiar\nGarret, Marie and the Spider-Snowman by MuttManComics\n\nTHE LOGISTICS\nAs mentioned before, this will be a 25+ page comic book. It will be identical in design to the last comic we produced for BRIC-A-BRAC #1. Because they are so similar, it was very easy for me to calculate shipping costs and how much I will need to deliver the best product possible. Here's some breakdowns for those interested:\nPRODUCTION OF COMIC (ART/LETTERING) : $5,000\nPRINTING (ISSUE 2 and REPRINTS of ISSUE 1): $1,000\nSHIPPING (NATION-WIDE AND INTERNATIONAL) : $2,500\nEXTRA FEES (KICKSTARTER FEES) :$500\n\nSHIPPING\nThis book will not be completed before Christmas, although we presently have about 20% of it done. My goal is to have it in your hands by January or February, which was the same time the books were in the backers hands with BRIC-A-BRAC #1. The digital books will be available first. This might be upsetting to backers, but digital copies of issue #1 will be available before Christmas 2020. If the physical copy being delivered before Christmas is a deal-breaker for you, we want you to know that this story is about the idea of Christmas--not the holiday. On Planet Christmas, Christmas is every single day.

Ramon Alejandro Est\u00e9vez-Guerrero roams the earth fighting these monsters in memory of his late wife and to make a better world for his daughter \u2013 he is the MONSTER MATADOR!\n WHO?\nRamon Alejandro Est\u00e9vez-Guerrero - the MONSTER MATADOR! \nWHAT?\nBorn from out love of Mad-Max, Kaiju and Santo and... telenovelas?! The Monster Matador is an action-packed mash-up of all those things, with more than a few laughs to spare. Just don't laugh at the Matador. He does not like to be laughed at.\nHOW?\nYes, how?! How exactly does a 6 ft tall Matador fight giant-sized-Kaiju monsters? With a cape and sword, of course. Sometimes also with dirty diapers, but we don't need to get into that here (hint, check out issue #2)\nWHY?\nUh, why not? But seriously did you not see the pull quote from DAVID PEPOSE of the hit Kickstarter THE  O.Z., or the one from Ringo-Award Winner RYLEND GRANT, or Kickstarter mainstay Clay Adams or... well, you get the picture.\nBut seriously, this book is a wild ride. If you love any of the things I mentioned above, or if you just love good comics, I promise you'll love MONSTER MATADOR. And for you art lovers out there, the book is drawn by Ringo Award Nominated artist FABIO ALVES (BANJAX, THE JUMP). Just check out this cover: \nFabio Alves Cover\n Right?!\nMONSTER MATADOR is written by Steven Prince with Colorist Alex Zief joining Fabio Alves on art duties. We launched the first issue of our 3-issue mini-series, Tango of the Matadors, on Kickstarter in June 2020 and were fully funded in 24 hours! Now we're back with Issue #2. \nOur campaign is to raise funds to print Monster Matador: Tango of the Matadors #2 and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way.\nPsst, these are our variant covers from Tony Donley (ALBERT EINSTEIN: TIME MASON) and FANGORIA artist Puis Calzada. \nTony Donley KS Exclusive and Puis Calzada Limited Variant\nIn Chapter 1 we met the Monster Matador in the midst of battle with the dreaded Volagante and her brood among the Mayan ruins in Guatemala. Fighting alongside a rag-tag group of locals and joined by a second \"Monster Matador\", they formulate a plan to defeat the Volagante once and for all...\nPLAY\n\nChapter 2 continues the story with action, adventure, romance, and... betrayal. I'm hesitant to give away more because there are some great twists and turns and a cliffhanger that I guarantee will have your jaw on the floor. Oh, and there's that thing about fighting monsters with dirty diapers I mentioned above.\nThe main story is 27 pages and will be printed on UV coated glossy paper with a 100lb UV coated cover stock. Here's a look at what to expect...\nRingo Award Nominee for Best Cover Artist, Fabio Alves (BANJAX, THE JUMP), draws our main cover with striking colors from Alex Zief (HATCHET, RAMAS) featuring the Matadors and Angelo riding to battle.\nFabio Alves Cover\nIn addition to the main cover from Fabio Alves, you can also choose from our Kickstarter Exclusive Cover by Tony Donley and Variant Cover by Puis Calzada with colors by Alex Zief. Both covers will be printed in extremely limited quantities.  \nTony Donley KS Exclusive & Puis Calzada/Alex Zief Variant\nMissed issue #1? Don't worry, we've got you covered. Choose from the main Fabio Alves cover, KS Exclusive by Kyle Roberts or the Check Your Matador Variant. Both the KS Exclusive and Check Your Matador are available in very limited quantities. \nAs a special thank you and bonus, each Issue 2 cover will come with its own trading card. Certain tiers will also come with an additional Signature card signed by Creator/Writer Steven Prince. And you'll also have the opportunity to get a mini-print of Tony Donley's Kickstarter Exclusive cover.\nHonestly, we just thought this was cool... and it looks pretty awesome, too. This 9x12 glow-in-the-dark screenprint is printed by world-famous Nakatomi Print Labs on 100lb Cougar White stock. For the color scheme we decided to go with the colors of the Mexican flag to represent the Monster Matador's heritage. \nArt: Fabio Alves. Color/Design: Steven Prince. Limited Edition of 55. S/N by Steven Prince\nWe have a very limited amount of Tony Donley original art Sketch cards that will be available in their own specific tier. Here's a peak at some of the cards:  \nYou'll also be able to get sketch cards from series creator, Steven Prince. Here's a sampling:\nFabio draws digitally, so original art from Tango of the Matador's is rare to put it simple. Tony Donley's cover, however, was done in pen and ink on Bristol board. This is your chance to own the 9x12 original art to Tony's Kickstarter Exclusive cover in a reward tier that includes everything but the kitchen sink!. \nAll backers will receive extra bonus content throughout the campaign, and we'll be adding stretch goals along the wat including stickers, prints, digital comics and more!\nDETAILS COMING SOON!!! \n\nAnd if there is some combination of rewards that you don't see or would like, we are happy to work with you and get you what you want.

Jump on board now, because this will be your only chance!\nHAUNTING is an ongoing supernatural horror comic series. It is written and created by Phil Falco, with art by Anna Wieszczyk, colors by Andres Samboni, and letters by LetterSquids.\nHAUNTING follows Bram, your average, everyday bratty teenager...who just so happens to RAISE THE DEAD!\nWherever he goes, ghosts appear - restless spirits that attack the living viciously and without prejudice. Bram has spent his entire life turning a blind eye to the destruction and deaths caused by his strange ability. But his recklessness finally catches up to him in the form of Deacon, a mysterious and vengeful man from his past. Deacon corners Bram and Faith, a small-town girl with a tragic past, in Dusty Springs. Now Bram will be forced to learn that his actions have consequences... whether he takes responsibility for those consequences is another question entirely.\nOur first Kickstarter was a success, so we're back with more supernatural goodness! When we last left Bram and Faith, the two had just barricaded themselves in a church mausoleum. Unfortunately for Faith, she is unaware of Bram's ability. And she has no idea just how much danger she's in!\n\nCheck out this 5-page Preview for HAUNTING #2 below!

Big time.... Before I get started if you'd like an audio version of this section, click to hear about the campaign in my own words whilst scrolling.\nA few years back I picked up a camera and filmed myself trying to poach an egg. I stuck the clip on the Internet... and it changed my life. I taught myself how to cook online and subsequently fell in love with good food, plus accidentally became part of a really cool story; inspiring people to cook, helping viewers through tough times and, I guess to a degree, becoming an online friend to lots of folk around the world.\nMy Wife (aka Mrs Barry) made this as she said it sums me up in two photos?!\nIf you don\u2019t know, I live in Weston-super-Mare, a small seaside town in South West England. I absolutely love pizza and want to share my passion for it here in my town by creating an artisan pizzeria complete with wood-fired pizza, fresh dough and the most funky, cosy layout that doubles up as a cooking school for all you guys around the world.\nThis is a huge passion project of mine, I\u2019ve been waiting on the right premises for 18 months, and it is just perfect. Of course it\u2019s risky, everything is, but I believe in it massively and want to give something back to my hometown, as well as to everyone whose followed my journey over the years.\nYes, that's me lol\nHere\u2019s the twist: the campaign is called 'The People's Pizzeria' because the Pizzeria doesn\u2019t have a name, logo, colour scheme, anything...yet. I want you to work with me and vote to decide those things and so much more! I also want to give a portion of any profits away to a charity every year, and again you can help me pick that. Who knows, if this works maybe it could inspire other creators to give back too in a similar way.\nI\u2019ve created some hopefully awesome rewards: behind-the-scenes video diaries, signed cookbooks, digital cooking classes, right up to having your name on the wall, or your own pizza on the menu! There really should be something for everyone so please do check them all out, some even feature some very special guests...\nHere's answers to some of the most popular questions i've been initially asked\nWill you still be doing videos? Yep, don\u2019t worry, the channel isn\u2019t going anywhere! In fact, I could potentially be doing even more! I\u2019d love to film extra videos in the pizzeria from time to time, do podcasts there, special events and of course I will be hosting cooking classes both in person and for the internet & selling kitchen gadgets there & online....I\u2019ve some pretty big plans for extra content, watch this space.\nWhat do you need to raise? I need to raise an absolute minimum of \u00a320k to help pay for a pizza oven and some basic other essential costs. Any extra funds raised can help with refrigeration, a dough machine, fitting out costs, staff, rent & ingredients, the list is endless, but this will get me started. IF I do pass the target, I have stretch goals.\nWhy crowdfund? I love the concept of having a collaborative project with a community. I\u2019ve seen & backed my friends like DanNerdCubed, Stuart Ashen and Paul Rose do it and it\u2019s very inspiring. I love that it\u2019ll help build a great community around the project straight from the beginning to help shape what it is and can be, something that\u2019s not just mine but ours.\nIf you don\u2019t raise enough funds will it happen? Probably not. I have to minimise risks to make it achievable, so if you think it\u2019s a cool idea and want to help make my dreams come true, please support it!\nCan I get a reward as a gift for someone? Yep, a lot of the perks have no time limit so you can get them as a voucher for a birthday, Christmas, that anniversary you forgot about (it's tomorrow, I've got your back) or just a general gift.\nI live overseas, what\u2019s in it for me? I've tried to make loads of the rewards available to everyone, things that will be posted or emailed. And you know you may even come to England one day & have a day out by the sea with your pizza voucher, visit the place that you helped create and see your name on the wall! How cool would that be?\nThe pizzeria will also mean more, fresh content for you to enjoy wherever you are in the world. And let's not rule out one day making more locations in other countries too - dream big right?!\nWhat about the cooking school part? This will be so cool. The pizzeria will also host and produce cooking classes. You can come in and attend courses in person and we will also over time start to create modules for download, co-hosted by myself and an expert in the field, alongside e-books and recipe cards. This really is just the tip of the iceberg (lettuce) of the plans.\nIf you can\u2019t support the campaign, I understand, but you can also help in other ways - It might be that you are, or know someone that makes signs or drinking glasses & can help out. But honestly the thing that would mean the most to me is if you shared this campaign with as many friends as you can that may discover and want to be part of the story. Hopefully you can see that this isn\u2019t just a restaurant, it\u2019s potentially something really special.\nLook, I know this is completely bonkers, going from learning to poach an egg to possibly creating my own pizzeria and cooking school. But I truly believe in this and, just like in Wayne's\u2019 World, maybe just maybe, \u201cif you make it, they will come\u201d.\nThanks so much for your support, please check out the perks and until next time\u2026 thanks for watching.\nBarry xx", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy biggest risk is going for it.

Well done, guys.\"\n~ JLS Comics\n\"I'm really excited for the ride and where it's going to go!\"\n~ Comic Uno\nIssue one of Celestial Falcon was completely self-funded. We then came to Kickstarter with a Deluxe Edition of that issue with a new back-up story and additional content, which was successfully funded and has shipped out to our backers.\nWe are dedicated and committed to this story and will release it whether it gets funded or not, it will just take longer without Kickstarter. \n For Last Ember Press, Kickstarter has played an integral role in our business, having successfully funded 7 previous campaigns to date. We love the community on this platform, and we value your pre-orders and contributions toward seeing our projects birthed and completed. We truly couldn't do this without you.\nBy helping us accomplish this goal, we will be able to complete issue 2 in a timely fashion and continue growing this series right here on Kickstarter with you!\nWe'll be using the funds raised in this campaign to complete the art on this issue, as well as get it printed and shipped out to all our backers! Any additional funds will go right back into production for future issues! Here's the general breakdown:\nCheck out these killer pages straight from the issue! Plans are made, threats are encountered and secrets are revealed!\nThe Characters\n We Care About Our Products \nAnd we know you do too! That's why we make sure they are as safe as possible, bagged and boarded, and inserted inside Gemini Comic Supply Comic Flash Mailers to protect your investment!\nAdditional smaller rewards, if applicable, will be secured in bubble envelopes and placed inside the mailers with the comics.\nThe Celestial Crate will be bubble wrapped and then inserted into another shipping box so that it is not damaged either.\nIf you have decided to join us on this journey, THANK YOU sincerely from the entire creative team of Celestial Falcon and everyone at Last Ember Press and Shooting Star Universe.\nWe are already working on the rest of the issue, and once it funds we'll kick that into high gear so we can get it into your hands sooner.\nIf you haven't decided yet, scroll back through the page, and if you're a fan of SUPERHEROES, SHARKS, SUPERNATURAL VILLAINS and FUN, COMING OF AGE stories, please show your support by backing this campaign!\nIf you have backed it, consider spreading the word so more people like you can find it!\nYou can direct your friends to CELESTIALFALCON.COM/ks2 or use one of these links:\nShare on Facebook\nShare on Twitter\nThanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe realize how risky backing a project can be, so we want to alleviate that concern.\n\nLast Ember Press has successfully funded 7 previous campaigns, 5 of which are fulfilled, 1 is in the process as I type this (books are shipping to our HQ now), and 1 is having the art finished up currently. We have delivered and often over-delivered on our promises at the end of the day and will continue to do so.\n\nLEP and SSU are in this for the long haul. We are passionate and dedicated to completing quality books and getting them in the hands of our readers.\n\nAs for Celestial Falcon #2, while the book is not yet done, we have continued working on it leading up to and are still working on it during this campaign in order to get it completed as quickly as possible. We have also given ourselves some buffer room this time in case things do get delayed, so that you can expect to receive your rewards in the estimated time frame detailed on the page above and in the rewards.\n\nWe value your support and know that at any given time there are a number of other projects you could be backing instead of ours. We greatly and deeply appreciate you choosing to put your support with us on Celestial Falcon #2.\n\nSo really, the only risk is missing out on an awesome project should you choose not to support it.

He's the first person born with superpowers.  The city's current hero, The Ascender, was patrolling the skies in a metal suit (like Iron Man).  After Johnny's brother got hurt by a psychopath, and the Ascender chose not to intervene, or even help, Johnny decided that he could do a better job, and became KINETIC.\nWell, after two years, eight issues, and thousands of books sold online and at conventions, he's beat the bad guy, mastered his powers, and got the girl.\nNOW WHAT?!\nKinetic: Identities #1 picks up where the story left off.  When a villain from his past is up to his old tricks, it's up to Johnny to save the day!\nBut is Kinetic a match for the villains when this time, they're ready for him?!\nIf you are a card-carrying Kinetic VIP, welcome back!  But if this is your first time hearing about this series, don't worry, I've got you covered.  You don't have to have know anything to read and enjoy this issue, and I've also got plenty of catch-up tiers to get you up to speed.\nThree Main Covers to Choose from!\nI get emails, messages, and even mail to my PO Box all the time asking me when there will be more Kinetic. \nI'm happy to know the answer: RIGHT NOW.\nThere are even more awesome rewards further down the page, but here's a sneak peak at a couple of our reward tiers for backers:\nAt some of  our higher tiers, we also have rare and Kickstarter exclusive rewards, such as Physical Scripts, and these Ultra-Limited Black and White Variants:\nUltra-Limited - ONLY 30 available!\nThis is the first time Kinetic is being offered internationally, but also, ALL ORDERS SHIPPED IN THE USA HAVE FREE SHIPPING!\nI've also got a few other fun surprises up my sleeve as the campaign moves forward...\nThough I'm the writer and creator, Kinetic wouldn't be able to happen without the help of my entire creative team!  They should get all the accolades for how great this book looks!  Here's a little about me, and the rest of the creative team:\nThis book wouldn't be able to happen without the help of my wonderful creative team, and I am proud to call them collaborators and friends!\nSince my very first time behind a booth at my first comic convention, Kinetic has built up a dedicated fanbase...\nAnd a few reviewers, and industry professionals have had some nice things to say, too!\nThere's been a little hiatus since the last Kinetic book released.  We've had to deal with losing an artist and finding a replacement.  Thankfully, we found a wonderful talent in indie comic veteran Luis Rivera.  I met him at a convention, and hit it off immediately.  With Luis onboard, we could get started again.  I am proud to say that, except for Rafael, the creative team remains completely unchanged!\nI just had to tell more of Kinetic's story.  Like so many of you, I've also fallen in love with the world of Velo City, and I knew Johnny's tale wasn't over yet.\nWe're coming back to Kickstarter because my first campaign was so successful, and I want to keep sharing Kinetic with this wonderful community.  Since joining Kickstarter as a backer, I've helped over 50 creators by backing their projects and make their dreams come true.  Kickstarter really is the place you want to find the newest and freshest comics!\nSince last year, we've been running the gauntlet with 2020.  So why now?  Well, with so much going on in the world, the best way I feel that I can help is to continue offering up awesome comics to you.  A sense of normalcy is important in turbulent times, even if it's just a little getaway time away from the madness.\nThe funds raised here will be used to fund the print run of Kinetic, Identities #1, and shipping those books to you.\nIf we're lucky enough to overfund, we'll put that towards making more great comics.\n I would never ask you to back something that I wasn't 100% sure we could completely finish in a timely manner.  The artwork is almost totally done for this book, and I think Luis and Omi did a great job:\nNow, you may notice a few characters are unfinished.  Astute eye, my diligent reader! For the first time ever, we are offering to have you (or a loved one!) DRAWN INTO KINETIC!  You can either be a citizen saved by Kinetic (and help him try to catch the bad guys) OR become a nefarious GOON.\nFind out more about that, and a ton of other fun reward tiers, below...\n\n\nHere's the plan:\nThis is the first campaign I have run where our custom reward tiers (being drawn into the story) actually mean the art is almost entirely done.  I'm factoring in extra time it will take Luis, Omi, and Lucas to have high end backers drawn in the story.  I doubt it will take as long, BUT I'd rather estimate a long time and get you the book ahead of schedule than the other way around.\nHere's what our timeline looks like:\nAgain, I think this timeline is the worst case scenario.  I'd rather estimate a longer time period, and deliver early, than the other way around.\nI want to get these books into your hands as fast as possible. \nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nI'll replace it free of charge.\n\nThank you for checking out this Kickstarter!  Kinetic would not be possible without the support of the wonderful fans, and I appreciate you giving me the chance to make my dreams of becoming a comic book writer a reality!\nNow, I'm going to ask you to look over our awesome reward tiers, find the one you like best, and let's get Kinetic: Identitites #1 in YOUR hands!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the best parts about working on Kinetic, Volume 1 was it let me get a lot of the inconsistencies and mistakes out of my system. This book is nearly complete: all that's needed now to finish the art is to add in any likenesses from the higher end reward tiers, and then send it to the printer. My last Kickstarter fulfilled before it's estimated time, and I will do my best to fulfill this campaign early, as well.\n\nWith the uncertainties in the world, mainly shipping delays due to COVID, we have added a healthy buffer in the timeframe to account for any delays. We've also estimated very, VERY conservatively for how long it will take to finish artwork and print the books.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital - Kinetic: Identities #1", "descp": "A digital copy of Kinetic: Identities #1.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Deluxe Copy - Kinetic: Identities #1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Physical - Luis Rivera Cover", "descp": "In addition to the digital version, you also get the physical book - Kinetic: Identities #1, featuring the Luis Rivera cover.

Show\n 4th Radom Original Art Give-Away art by Kevin Leen was shown on the SkyStorm Universe Sanctum episode 2 currently on YouTube search SkyStorm Universe\n An immense stone of extraordinary power held the layers of time in sync from the instant the universe itself was created. \nThe stone was placed outside the time stream by the Time Lords who watched over and protected the stone throughout eternity.\nThat was the plan.\nUntil it was that some of the Time Lords desired the stone for themselves and caused the stone to be shattered into shards and scattered throughout history. But not before they escaped and vanished to scheme anew.\nThe banished time lord Marta assembled her own group of villainous Rogues to find the time lost shards, promising them wealth and power beyond imagining. However, what greater power could they imagine but the Time Stone itself?\nChronos and the other Time Lords sent forth their own guardian Agents who were given the task of finding each shard in the hope once the stone was pieced back together, it would set time back into balance before eternity itself ceased to exist.\nAnd so began The PARADOX WARS\u2026\nTime Agents Tamara Rose and Christiana Blood land in a future where steam engines and dinosaurs roam the land. They discover Marta even has a presence in this time recruiting more to her band of rogues and the importance of a dormant volcano and how it will help them get back to their home base of Infinity... if it still exists.\nFor over 25 years, we\u2019ve brought you the adventures of the heroes and villains of the Skystorm Universe and now with this Kickstarter, we bring it all together in Paradox Wars: Shattered Time. \nAs we launch our first Kickstarter campaign for Paradox Wars the art and coloring is done we just need to wrap up the lettering. \nThen off to print, package and ship but... that\u2019s where YOU are needed!\nPrinting and shipping is expensive and a major cost of this project.

After years of touring, releasing solo music, studying art, producing, and collaborating on the NAMO record, we've finally decided to dive into something we've put off for far too long. We've been making music here in Nashville for most of our lives, but we've never made a record just the three of us... until now!\nAsher's a drummer, engineer, and record producer. Aedan's a visual artist, musician, and songwriter. Skye's a singer/songwriter with two EPs and a few tours under her belt. Thanks to COVID-19 we found ourselves grounded in Nashville with time to make music together. On the day of our first official band meeting, a massive storm pounded Nashville, followed by a rush of damaging winds. The next day, the meteorologists said that it was a weather phenomenon called a \"wake low\"--a rush of wind after a storm, caused by a spike in temperature. Thus, a band was born. The concept for the record was born, too.\n We know there's a lot of darkness in the world. Right now, we feel like our calling is making beautiful art, and writing good, true songs.\nOur goal is to record a twelve-song, self-produced album. We spent weeks in quarantine planning this record and writing the songs together, and we're super excited about the opportunity to make them as beautiful as we can and share them with the world. We've already been in contact with some of our dream engineers and players, and we can't wait to show you what we're working on! To give you an idea of the sonic landscape we're aiming for, some of our influences right now include The National, Brandon Flowers, Better Oblivion Community Center, Ethan Gruska, S. Carey, M83, and Tyson Motsenbocker. If we can get close to the way those artists make us feel, we'll be happy.\nBUDGET\nWe thought a lot about this campaign, and the number we've landed on is $16,000. This is a LOT of money. But we feel confident that with this budget, we can make a really great sounding record. With this goal, we'll be able to bring in some of our favorite musicians and engineers in Nashville work on this album.\nIJM\nHere's the awesome part. Although we can't give any funds raised on kickstarter directly to a charity, once the campaign is finished and the record is out, we'll be giving 100% of Wake Low's profits for a year to an organization we love called International Justice Mission. IJM is a non-profit that works around the globe rescuing victims of human trafficking. We're so excited for the opportunity to try to use music as a means to help vulnerable men, women, and children in need. Check out IJM's website here!\nREWARDS\nIf you can help us, we've come up with some super fun Wake Low rewards. Here are some of the things we'll be offering:\nStickers\nCDs\nT-Shirts\nPrints\nHand-written Lyrics\nCheck out the reward tiers in the \"Support\" section!\nHOW TO HELP\nThe best way to help is to either pledge here on this page, or share this campaign on social media!

It\u2019s been my dream since I was a kid, struggling with Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia, to be in the comic book business. Comic books helped me learn how to deal with my learning disability. When I was 14-years-old, I wrote fan fiction for the X-Men and submitted it to Marvel in hopes that Stan Lee would read it. Someone from Marvel was nice enough to write back to me saying that Stan loves to hear from his fans and encouraged me to keep up my writing. As naive as I was at the time, it spread my passion for the business like a wild fire and inspired me to go to art school at Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, where I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Applied Media Arts. I have been working on Night Wolf since I was 16-years-old. The story and the characters have grown up with me, evolving into the amazing tale that it is today.\nWhy a werewolf comic book? Well, I have always loved any werewolf or supernatural related entertainment in movies, video games, etc. I didn't feel like there were any comic books out there doing werewolves any justice, so I decided to make a comic book based on a werewolf anti-hero myself. In high school, after I started developing Night Wolf, I got into Werewolf: The Apocalypse is a role-playing game by White Wolf Publishing.  I love the artwork in the game guides so much that I longed for them to put out a comic book to build on their world. Unfortunately, it never happened, but the artwork heavily influenced how I like my werewolves should look in my comics.\nCarlos Herrera is a Professional illustrator residing in Santiago City, Chile.

I appreciate so it so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm a relatively new creator and Night Wolf is my first comic book series. In April of 2016, I launched a failed Kickstarter campaign for Night Wolf Issues 1-3. I played the game on hard, setting a $20,000 goal. However, I did manage to raise $5,064 from my 74 backers, unfortunately Kickstarter is all or nothing. At the time I only had the character designs, a cover and 5 sequential pages during that launch. Even though the Kickstarter didn\u2019t fund I was bound and determined to publish my story. Because I didn\u2019t have the funds to finish the first issue, I decided to raise the money on my own doing freelance web design work to pay for the artwork. \n\nAfter self-publishing Night Wolf Issues 1 and 2, I launched another Kickstarter in October 2019 to print Night Wolf Issues 3 with a more reasonable funding goal of $5,000. The campaign successfully over funded, thanks to the amazing 217 backers that I refer to as my Wolf Pack. Now I'm back and ready for round 3 to print Night Wolf Issue 4.\n\nI know it seems like there's a lot going on all over the world right now that is very stressful for us all. Collecting, reading, and creating comics books have always been an escape from the stressful things in my life. My hope is that by creating my comics books and putting them out into the world for you to enjoy also helps to relieve some of your stress as well. And that is what I am laser focused on doing!\n\nIn addition, I have been educating myself through the Comixlaunch course, which is a Kickstarter training program created by Tyler James. Tyler is the Publisher of ComixTribe and has successfully funded over 17 Kickstarter campaigns.

Brown\u2019s Like Father, Like Daughter returns with a heart pounding sixth installment \u2013 self publishing for the first time under Calamia\u2019s brand Comic Uno, a reliable source in comics for over a decade. \nWriter - Kat Calamia\nNext to her weekly comic book reviews on Comic Uno, Calamia also currently works for Newsarama and DC Comics\u2019 DC Universe with bylines with IGN, Fandom, and TV Guide. She has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Communications and minor in Journalism through Marymount Manhattan and a MFA in Writing and Producing Television from LIU Brooklyn.\nArtist - Wayne A. Brown\nBrown has been an artist his whole life, being more passionate about art than anything in the world. He has a degree in Graphic Design, four wonderful children two boys and two girls, a beautiful wife.\nColorist - Lisa Moore\nLisa Moore is a comic book enthusiast, colorist and illustrator, who has worked as a colorist on books like GARFIELD, PEANUTS, BRAVEST WARRIORS, and more for BOOM! Studios, DAMSELS AND GRIMM for Dynamite and more. She's the writer of SECRETS OF WILLOWMYST from Last Ember Press where she's co-Publisher. She also just got married to her best friend - Brant Fowler!\nLetterer - Matt Bowers\nMatt Bowers is a Memphis, TN based artist that puts out an ongoing comic book simply called MEMPHIS. He also does freelance lettering for several indie comic book titles such as: Like Father, Like Daughter, They Call Her...The Dancer, American Dreams, Crucified, Concrete Jungle, Snatched, and Lawfully Evil \nLFLD #6 Regular Cover\nA father with superpowers, leaves his wife and daughter to become \u201cInvulnerable\u201d - the world\u2019s only superhero. Ten years later his daughter discovers that she has inherited the very superpowers that made her father leave their family.\nSix issues later - Casey and Invulnerable begin to reconnect, but is it too late? Following Like Father, Like Daughter #5\u2019s big revelation \u2013 issue 6 lifts the curtain on Casey\u2019s mother\u2019s double life.\nJessica pays Jim\u2019s mother a visit.\n This issue is all about the VILLAINS \u2013 characters just as grounded as the superhero plot!\n\nFollowing the release of the Like Father, Like Daughter #1\u2019s variant cover by Zack Dolan. We wanted to debut even more variant covers for Like Father, Like Daughter #6 from some amazing artists - exploring all different sides of the Like Father, Like Daughter universe.\n Cover B \u2013 \u201cThe Future/Celebrating Pride Month\u201d \u2013 Wayne A. Brown \nThese first two arcs have had a very heavy focus on Casey and her family drama, but I\u2019ve always said the heart of this book is and will always be Stephanie and Casey\u2019s friendship. Stephanie has been a support system for Casey, and now it's Casey\u2019s turn to be that for Stephanie as she explores her own self-identity. \nThere are plenty of coming out stories in media, but not many for bisexuals, and this is something I really wanted to explore with Stephanie's arc. I\u2019m excited for everyone to meet Stephanie\u2019s new love interest, Faith! It\u2019s a storyline I\u2019m very proud of that I can\u2019t wait for the world to see.  \nCover C \u2013 Black and White \u2013 \u201cFamily Reunion\u201d \u2013 E.V. Cantada\nAs our second arc continues you will be seeing the darker side of Like Father, Like Daughter. If you thought our first arc had an emotional punch \u2013 just you wait. E.V. Cantada the artist for my comic book, They Call Her\u2026The Dancer, beautifully displays this intensity with a Black and White variant. \n Cover D \u2013 \"Welcome to the Band\" - Sarah Leuver AKA ComickerGirl \nSure - there\u2019s a lot of drama, but Wes, Stephanie, and Casey\u2019s friendship will bring some levity along the way, as you can see with Comickergirl\u2019s variant, best known for her DC TV fan art. \nBack up both Brant Fowler's The Last Ember #1: Reforged and this Kickstarter at their physical tiers or higher to receive this beautiful print by Linnea Jalando-on, best known as @PapurrCat on Twitter.

Thank you so much!\n ...and some sweet stretch goals unlocked! (See below)\nThe king\u2019s dragon trainer is fired for accidentally unleashing a mutating corruption on the royal stables. Now, he must save his job and his reputation by finding a long-lost cure before the advancing orc horde takes advantage of this new weakness in the kingdom\u2019s defenses.\nThe main character in Mythic Creature Trainer is Ulrick.\nHe loves his pet griffin and takes him everywhere. Ulrick is always trying to get his housemate, Felka to help him out of a tight spot. She's a palace sentinel: an elite force of king's guards. Felka doesn't really care if Ulrick succeeds or fails, but she'll pitch in when it suits her.\nUlrick's boss is not all that he seems. Kevin the goblin has his own plans, and he's willing to throw Ulrick under the bus to get there.\nWhen orcs and goblins get together, that means trouble.\n Ulrick will discover the hard way that approval from others isn\u2019t the most important thing in life. There are characters in the story that will stand at different points on this spectrum: some crave approval and status, while others shun it and do what they feel like, without regard for others. \nWill Ulrick save the city and his reputation? More importantly, will he stay a total flake or become a towering pillar of integrity?\nBumper-sized 48-page issue!\nThis isn't my first Kickstarter! \nI've funded and fulfilled to satisfaction 2 other campaigns in the last 2 years. Here's some feedback from happy backers:\nSome of my happy kickstarter backers!\nHi! I'm Ren\u00e9, Australian cartoonist. I created, wrote and drew Mythic Creature Trainer.\nI've worked in the animation industry for over 20 years: in character design, animating for Disney on 10 different films, making flash animation for software and pilots for TV series. I was a storyboard artist on Classic Tales and Bob\u2019s Burgers.\nIn 2018 I funded my first graphic novel on Kickstarter, Sneaky Goblins: an all-ages story of fantasy mayhem, inspired by Adventure Time cartoons, Tolkien and World of Warcraft. I followed that up with a new comic: Sneaky Goblins at College, which successfully funded in 2019.\nSome of the films, TV and comics I've worked on:\nI've always loved drawing and telling stories. Making this book was a labor of love, and I hope that comes through as you read it.\n Included in every copy of Mythic Creature Trainer #1: Sophie the Spy is a 9-page short story, written by me and drawn by the talented Jake Kalsbeek, animator and cartoonist hailing from San Francisco! \nJake K, artist on Sophie the Spy\nJake worked as a 3D animator for games, DVD, commercials and TV, and has begun posting pages for nis new webcomic, Super Rocket Space Punch! Jake has strong memories of his first time experiencing E.T. in the movie theater as a five year old, reading Calvin and Hobbes in elementary, and finding Miyazaki\u2019s Nausicaa manga in college.\nSet before the events of Mythic Creature Trainer, this short story introduces us to the world of creature trainers, and shows us the link between the Sneaky Goblins storyline and Mythic Creature Trainer.\nSophie in spy mode: ingratiating herself with the savage orc tribe!\n \n   It's been so awesome to have Jake involved in the comic. Having another comic artist make his version of my characters is such a blast- it almost feels like my comics are gaining a life of their own!\n If you've been following the adventures of Sneaky Goblins, you might find this chart useful:\nYou get every single story pictured above when you back at the Catch-up Bundle!  (AU$90) pledge level and higher.\nMy 2018 Kickstarter: the Sneaky Goblins graphic novel!\n\nMythic Creature Trainer #1 comes in the regular BLUE SKY edition plus two limited-edition variant covers: CORRUPTION and SOPHIE THE SPY. Check below for full details about all reward levels.\nYou can grab yourself a limited SOPHIE THE SPY cover with the 'All the Editions!' pledge level.\nOver the last year, I've been making and posting the pages of this comic on my weekly webcomic: www.mythiccreaturetrainer.com. Now the first chapter is complete, and it's time to print the book! With your help, I'd love to make this book a reality, and get it into the hands of readers like you. \n\u00b7 A massive 48 pages, including cover\n\u00b7 full colour\n\u00b7 Perfect bound\n\u00b7 Cover: 105lbs (It'll feel sturdier than your average floppy comic book)\n\u00b7 Interior paper: 70lbs\n\u00b7 Size: 6.625 x 10.25in. \nIt will be beautiful!\nThe comic pages are 100% complete and ready for print! Your pledge will make this book a living, physical reality: a crisp, sweet-smelling printed comic book. \nAnd we're so close. Once this campaign funds, all l have to do is make the Thank You page and then send the files off to the printer.\nHere's my process for making a comic page: from rough sketch, to inks, to final colours:\nThe amount raised will all go to funding a print run of 1000 copies of the comic. Copies of the comic left over after the campaign will be stock that I can sell at comic conventions, libraries and book shops.\nI've come to Kickstarter to help get this book into as many hands as possible, and I'd love your support to bring it to life.\nLet's have a peek inside!\n\nWant more? GET A FREE PDF SAMPLE OF THE COMIC HERE!\nHere's what you get in each pledge level... with pictures!\n\n Here's some more of those signed sketches included in the AU$55 level and above:\nThey look great framed in regular 6x8\" window frames from Target:\n I made a process video making one of the sketch rewards:\n Check out more of the sketches available on this Pinterest board.\nYou can tell me which character you'd prefer in the comments, or through the Kickstarter survey at the end of the campaign, once the pledges have gone through. I can't guarantee you'll get the drawing you want, but I can get you your favourite character!\n Stretch goals UNLOCKED!\nWhat will the funds be used for?\nI'm only on Kickstarter to print the book and get them out to all of my wonderful backers! I'm not trying to make money or reimburse myself for any of the time I spent making the comic itself.\nThe whole amount raised will go back into the book, the rewards, and  shipping it out safely to you:\nYou should have your books by the end of November 2020.\nI plan on sending the final book files to to the printer as soon as the funds come through from Kickstarter (about 2 weeks after the campaign ends).\nPrinting will take a month or two- at the most. \nPostage is a bit more unpredictable, especially given the current state of the COVID-19 epidemic. But I've built in a buffer just in case there is a delay at any stage.\nI'll be packing and shipping the books from Melbourne, Australia, and from Pennsylvania, USA.\n Want to help the campaign?\nI'd love a share on the socials!

Oven-safe, non-stick silicone dividers that will streamline your cooking and divide your ingredients, to make one-pan meals and meal prepping a breeze.\nEveryone loves sheet pan cooking, but it\u2019s not always as simple as putting everything in the oven together and coming back to find it has all cooked evenly. Reality is, not everything takes the same amount of time to cook. With Cheat Sheets, you can easily remove ingredients when they're ready and never overcook them again.\nWe get it... If you're new to oven cooking, it can feel like a bit of a science experiment that involves a lot of guesswork. That's why we've tested the most popular everyday ingredients and created an easy timing guide so that you\u2019ll get perfect results every time.\nCheat Sheets are made for meal prep. With our modular dividers, you can cook all of your ingredients with even better organization and control. \nYou can fit up to 6x small portions or 3x large portions on a single sheet pan and with multiple sets, you'll have everything you need to prep for the family or a week's worth of meals.\nWith Cheat Sheets you can easily separate ingredients and flavors without having them mingle. Whether you want to use different marinades, cook savory and sweet dishes at the same time, or simply don\u2019t want your food to touch, Cheat Sheets has you covered.\nSeparation also comes in handy for families with different preferences, allowing you to create different portions for those with special dietary requirements or specific tastes - because not everybody likes pineapple on their pizza.\nAluminum foil and parchment paper are hugely wasteful and non-recyclable. Sheet pans are also notoriously difficult to clean, collecting stains and grime with every meal.\nWith Cheat Sheets you'll never have to scrub another sheet pan again and you'll save tonnes of wasted paper and foil. Cheat Sheets are naturally non-stick so clean-up is a breeze. They're also dishwasher safe!\n\nThe Cheat Sheets dividers are made with a premium, food-grade silicone material resistant to temperatures up to 450 degrees F. The dividers will fit on a standard half sheet pan or perfectly on the Prepd Sheet Pan included with each set.\nThe Prepd Sheet Pan is made from Aluminized Steel and coated with a non-stick PTFE and PFOA free coating.\n\nAround 18 months ago we had an insight...\nOut of all the Prepd Pack owners (now over 100,000 people), those who consistently meal prep all use sheet pans. But sheet pans have never changed since their inception. They are hard to clean, require you to constantly waste parchment paper and aluminum foil and are not designed to best serve how we actually cook, ie, multiple items in the oven at once.\nWe knew there had to be a better way. A solution that is easier to clean and gives ultimate versatility to the sheet pan. Allowing you to easily time each ingredient of the meal. A zero-waste solution removing the need to constantly create non-recyclable waste.\nWe were immediately drawn to silicone as it is completely food safe to high temperatures, naturally non-stick, long-lasting and resistant to bacteria. In our first phase of development, we tried dozens of different types of silicone and different colors to ensure our solution would be stain-resistant and have perfect heat transfer. Then we started our testing and prototyping phase. \nThis is where we started cooking meals in the Cheat Sheets to ensure every dimension was perfect and more importantly, food cooked just as well as on a 'naked' sheet-pan.\nWe then opened our first tooling, received FDA approval and did a wider beta test. The feedback was phenomenal all round.After hitting our Kickstarter funding goal we have kicked off all of our final tooling so that production can begin shortly after the campaign end.\n\"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . . \"Cooking just might be the single most important thing you can do for your dietary health . . .

It doesn\u2019t have to always be health food, so long as you cooked it and know the ingredients, that's enough.\nSince we started Prepd in 2015 it has been our sole focus to help make preparing meals at home easier and more enjoyable. By creating tools and systems to help make healthy living easier, we hope to make healthy resolutions - lifelong habits.\nPrepd was founded by two industrial designers, Chris Place & Will Matters.
