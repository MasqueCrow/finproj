The tension between the tribes was centuries old, but came to a head under the Belgian colonialism in the 19th and 2Oth centuries.\nThe stories of that horror are hard to hear and worse to see, but the stories today are very different: stories of forgiveness, reconciliation, and unity. The change over the ensuing decades is nothing short of a miracle. Emanuel Tuyishimire wants to bring these stories of the healing of his beloved country to the world. Born in Rwanda, but growing up in a Kenyan refuge camp, part Hutu and part Tutsi, Emanuel feels connected to both tribes. As he traveled across his Rwanda, he met many Rwandans who have taken a new path in the efforts to forge one tribe, bringing healing and forgiveness.\nEmanuel, now going to school in Colorado with a full soccer scholarship, will travel back to Rwanda to bring to you some of these amazing stories of personal forgiveness. He will interview Rwanda musician Benjamin Kagorola, lead singer in the Rwandan band TBB, who, at 5 years old learned that his Hutu neighbor had killed his father and his brother and sister, after this very neighbor had helped his mother and his other siblings to flee to a refugee camp in Kampala, Uganda. Benjamin\u2019s mother, although grieved for the loss of her children and husband, pleaded for mercy, which spared the neighbor from the death penalty. Now Benjamin, who has forgiven his neighbor, creates music celebrating one tribe. Other stories of forgiveness and healing abound, and Emanuel will interview people from both sides to bring these stories to you in an hour-long documentary to go to festivals across the world.\nThe Rwanda story has had many bumps in the road, and on going controversies, but the people are dedicated to uniting with forgiveness and reconciliation, a story that will touch your heart", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nShooting in a foreign, especially an African country, can be unpredictable and sometimes dangerous.

Set in a near-future when humans are leaving Earth to colonize other planets, the film tells the story of the people who stayed. In the small town of Truth or Consequences, the film follows five residents whose personal journeys open echoes of New Mexico\u2019s complex history of progress. Combining observational and archival footage with experimental new media, Truth or Consequences is a lyrical meditation on striving, loss, and finding what we\u2019re looking for in the unlikeliest of places.   \nThe town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico (gif by Hannah Jayanti)\n What is a speculative documentary?\nIn a practice we\u2019re calling speculative documentary, Truth or Consequences takes nonfiction footage filmed over three years in the town of Truth or Consequences and places it into a fictionalized context. The film is set in a near-future where the commercial space travel industry of today has succeeded, and people have begun to leave Earth to colonize other planets. As with science fiction, this speculative premise allows us to look more closely at the challenges of today. It shifts the way we view the documentary footage, allowing us to see the familiar in a new way, listen to people differently, and make new connections between the ideas the film explores.     \nThe Spaceport (animation by Alexander Porter)\n The Setting & Backstory\nIn the southern end of New Mexico lies the desert town of Truth or Consequences (\u201cT or C\u201d). In 1950, celebrity host Ralph Edwards put out a national challenge for a town to rename itself after his popular game show. Betting this would put their town on the map, Hot Springs became Truth or Consequences. Seventy years later, T or C is ranked the twenty second poorest town in the United States. Today, they are making a new bet on what might bring the prosperity they crave: space tourism.\nThough this sounds like science fiction, it\u2019s not. The Spaceport already exists and is twenty miles outside of T or C. Funded and maintained by New Mexican tax dollars, Spaceport America has cost $220 million to date. It\u2019s rented out to private companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, who have sold tickets to the likes of Lady Gaga for $250,000. One the one hand they promise a burgeoning commercial industry that will democratize space, and on the other they are responding to a fear that the Earth is dying and the survival of the human race relies on moving elsewhere. \n The People:\nIn Truth or Consequences, we take the potential of space travel as though it has happened. Rather than telling the story of the pioneers who left, the film tells the story of those who stayed. The heart of the documentary follows five residents:   \nYvonne | The Sage: \"The past reminds me of things I have released. My now is appreciate the now. What my future is, I'm one that helps make my future. But the show must go on\".\nGeorge | The Collector: \"You learn to sight value in minor things. If you can say there is value, even if they're small and inconsequential, it's hope again you know?\"\nKatie | The Searcher: \"I\u2019m learning not to think about forever anymore. Life is about temporary and always changing.\"\nOlin | The Artist: \"Well sometimes maybe I'm telling you the truth, and sometimes maybe I'm not.\"\nPhilip | The Realist: \"I think the town should change its name to the Price is Right.\"\n Why this film? Why now? \nThis film offers an alternative to traditional narratives about inequality. \n Truth or Consequences is, from one perspective, an allegory. The gap between the rich and poor is increasing and arguably the people of T or C have already been left behind. However, instead of centering the film on outlining the disparity itself, the film focuses on the people who live there - their search for meaning, their relationship to the land, the way they weave their past and future into their present, and the wisdom they find through the life they build. \nThis film offers an alternative to traditional narratives about climate change. \nClimate change is an increasing reality, and many believe we have passed the point of no return. As Stephen Hawking says: \u201cWhen we have reached similar crises there has usually been somewhere else to colonize... But there is no new world, no utopia around the corner. We are running out of space, and the only places to go to are other worlds.\u201d Who would get to go? What would life be like for those who stayed? When do we strive for what could be and when do we preserve what is?Truth or Consequences connects the coming climate crisis to stories of personal survival and the value of each life's journey on this earth.\nThis film challenges us to listen differently to people we might overlook.\nOne of the main intentions around re-contextualizing the footage into a near-future is that it helps us look at today's struggles with fresh eyes. Pressing questions about economic disparity, personal resilience and climate change rise to the surface in new and surprising ways. What do our life journeys teach us? What does it mean to be marginalized? What would it look if we treated each life with the dignity and richness it deserves?  In our current political, social and environmental situation, they inspire the kind of pressing conversations we need to have.    \nVirtual Reality Animations | Recreations of the town filmed in VR\n Why are we doing a Kickstarter?\nWe are in an exciting and critical moment for this film.

Photo by Lars Jan.\nWe\u2019re stretching our goal to $40,000 to fulfill a critical new idea:\nA contextual exhibition centered on the protests of 1968 that travels with the performance.\nIn order to achieve the goal of the traveling exhibition, we need to\n1) hire a new collaborator, and \n2) invest in materials to create the exhibition itself\n\u2014 hence our new $40K goal. \nOur research and conversations in residency in Wyoming have introduced the need for\nStorytelling, Experience AND Education in this work.\nWhile talking and working with contemporary students and young people I\u2019ve realized that knowledge of the student protest movements of the \u201860s \u2014 including Berkeley, Columbia and SF State College (which is covered in The White Album) \u2014 is thin to non-existent. \nPart of examining the past is passing knowledge on to the present generation, in the hopes that our actions can build on the momentum of earlier movements. \n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\"I was supposed to have a script, and had mislaid it. I was supposed to hear cues, and no longer did.\" \n                    ~ Joan Didion, The White Album\nThe White Album is among the most important essays ever written, by one of America's most incisive, essential writers. This fall, my collaborators and I will premiere a multidisciplinary theatre work featuring Obie-winning actor Mia Barron performing the entirety of the essay.\nIn this seminal essay, Joan Didion traverses the tectonically shifting landscape and iconic characters of the late 1960's \u2014 The Black Panthers, student protests, The Doors, Charles Manson \u2014 and she tells this particular story with herself at its center. Her voice is unmistakable: at turns unequivocally cool, impossibly illuminating, and just shy of total collapse. \nAfter a twenty-year personal obsession with the essay and an epic quest to secure the theatrical rights, I have been given the green light. And we\u2019re going to stage every word.  \nWe premiere at Pittsburg's Festival of Firsts (Oct 2018), go on to the BAM Harvey Theatre as part of the 2018 Next Wave Festival (Nov 2018), and then on to Los Angeles, courtesy of a co-presentation by Center Theatre Group & The Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA (Apr 2019). \nWHY NOW // 1968 - 2018 \nDidion writes about the dimensions and character of American chaos more articulately and sensitively that any other writer. While The White Album focuses on the late \u201860s in California, it\u2019s hard not to feel the uncanny threads that connect us now to the revolutionary legacies of that time.\n50 years later, we again wrestle openly with racist and sexist tumults, absurd inequity, and so much violence that it's become as American as apple pie. Our performance uses this masterpiece of an essay as a portal into that time, and considers the forms these legacies take in our lives today.\nPerformer Mia Barron during an early development residency at The Headlands Center for the Arts. Photo by Lars Jan.\n\"We tell ourselves stories in order to live.\" \n                    ~ Joan Didion, The White Album\nThis opening line of the essay hits on a double-edged truth that runs through the performance.  First, storytelling is living. Second \u2014 and this is the sharper of the edges \u2014 the stories may be, in part, creative acts of self-delusion.\nOur performance is double-edged too, and in a way, there are actually two performances happening at the same time, one nested inside of the other, for two distinct audiences. One audience, seated in the theatre, experiences every word of the essay's fifteen vignettes\u2014 which span from 1966 to 1971\u2014 performed in full by Obie award-winning actor Mia Barron. Behind her is a large soundproof room, with a glass wall. Inside this room, the second audience creates a house party onstage that increasingly takes on a life of its own.\nThe party \u2014 which we\u2019ll create together with the second audience \u2014 is a parable for the late 60\u2019s, and for right now. It synchronizes and resonates with the performance of the essay throughout.\nUltimately, the glass wall opens, the two audiences meet across a massive divide that is both physical and generational, and have to choose whether to party... or riot.\nWe need your help to make this meeting happen in cities across the country.\nStructure designed by P-A-T-T-E-R-N-S Architecture\nYOUR SUPPORT \nWe can't realize our concept for The White Album without the fully portable, soundproof room that has been designed for us by our collaborators at P-A-T-T-E-R-N-S Architecture.\nThe structure features cutting-edge lighting and sound technology, and allows us to throw a party onstage during the performance, which can be fully seen through a giant glass wall \u2014 but, critically, not heard. And, part of the magic of the structure is essential, but never seen by audience: it sets up and breaks down into tourable parts in hours.\nThe party is a parable and the structure is our portal.

I found the courage to share my original songs publicly a few years ago and in doing so found myself cradled by a supportive music community in Portland, Oregon. This community has been cheering me on to become a performer and recording artist but a sneaky undiagnosed chronic illness temporarily crumbled this dream. After recovering I was able to remember, perform and write songs again. Faced with my mortality, the motivation to record became stronger than ever before and pushed me to professionally produce these seven songs last February.\nMy bandmates Taylor Kingman (guitar and bass), Alexis Mahler (cello), Buddy Weeks (drums), David Lipkind (harmonica) and I recorded our debut album 'Crazy Dog' with Justin Phelps at the Hallowed Halls in Portland, Oregon. We finished the record in three days and mixed the songs over the course of a few months then the album was sent off to be mastered by John Baldwin. \nThe title track \"Crazy Dog\" was released as a single last April 2017 and can be heard on bandcamp and soundcloud. \nThe band at the Hallowed Halls Recording Studio with engineer Justin Phelps Photo by Heather Hanson\nOver the last year, we've been playing the songs from this record in various venues all over Portland, Oregon. It is has been an incredible experience to hear and feel how these songs have evolved over time. The record we made captured some beautiful collaborative magic along with a grooving vibe.\nWe are very excited about getting this record out to you and the rest of the world and need your help to get there. Can you please help us make this record a reality by donating what you can and sharing this campaign with friends and family? We need all the support we can get. \nI am very grateful for your support and contribution. Thank you.\nMarch 9th, 2018 at Mississippi Studios (Portland, Oregon) Photo by Daniel Stindt\nPROJECT DETAILS: \n'Crazy Dog' has already been recorded and mixed. Currently we need funds to help with the post production costs so that this music can become available virtually and physically. Our collaborative post-production team has been a dream to work with. The photographic work for the album cover was created by the majestic Miranda Lehman. The graphic designer Dora Jane had the most attentive eye to detail. Local visual artist AWAKE created the art design for the tote bags. MAITA designed and printed the shirts. Chris Freeman helped edit the kickstarter video. \nThe cost breakdown:\nMastering for CD $475 \nMastering for Vinyl $630\nAlbum Art & Design $600\n1,000 CDs $1300\n500 Vinyl $3000\nDownload cards $125\nDigital Distribution $90\nT-Shirts $300\nI've set the goal for $6000.

(Again.)\nA little over a year ago, more than 787 backers took a leap of faith on us, helping us bring our first Kickstarter project to life. We wanted to create a photobook documenting sanatoriums \u2014 a kind of Soviet-era health spa meets hospital \u2014 but had no photographs to show.\nNow we're back -- and this time, we come bearing photos. \nImage: Michal Solarski\nWe used the money raised on our first Kickstarter campaign to travel to more than 30 sanatoriums in more than 10 post-Soviet countries. The resulting photobook, Holidays in Soviet Sanatoriums, will be available for purchase in autumn 2017. We're lucky to be published by Fuel, designers of the most exquisite books. \nKuyalnik sanatorium, Ukraine. Image: Egor Rogalev\nOur journey\nWith the funds raised, members of our team travelled to Russia, Ukraine, Abkhazia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Latvia, Belarus, Moldova and Azerbaijan. The journey had its ups and downs. We were turned away by some sanatoriums but welcomed with open arms by others. \nImage: Natalia Kupriyanova\nAlong the way we slathered ourselves in mud, sprinkled magnetic sand over our bodies and immersed ourselves in crude oil baths. We stumbled upon new sanatoriums, snuck into others and climbed up hills to find the best vantage points for the best photos. \nImage: Rene Fietzek\n History lesson: What is a sanatorium?\nDuring the Soviet Union, workers spent up to two weeks a year at sanatoriums, which are similar spas but with a strong medical component. The objective was to recover from the exertions of their labour so that they could return to work with renewed vigour. Our photobook is an examination of the utopian, socialist ideals that these sanatoriums were founded upon as well as their legacy. This is especially important given the current state of sanatoriums. While some continue to function, many have fallen into disrepair; others still have been completely modernised. \nImage: Dmitry Lookianov\nThe team\nThe original team includes Olya Ivanova (Russia), Dmitry Lookianov (Russia), Rene Fietzek (Germany), Michal Solarski (Poland), Egor Rogalev (Russian) and Claudine Doury (France). Unfortunately due to copyright issues Claudine's work will be offered in the book (forthcoming, 2017) but not as part of this campaign. We're also happy to have added two new team members. The first was Vladimir Shipotilnikov, a photographer from Ukraine who joined us on our travels as a volunteer assistant. His architectural photography blew us away so we decided to include a few of his pictures in our book. The second addition was Russian photographer Natalia Kupriyanova who had independently visited various sanatoriums in Russia.\nImage: Vladimir Shipotilnikov\nThe rewards\nOur photobook, Holidays in Soviet Sanatoriums, will be available for purchase later this year. Although backers of our first campaign were offered the photobook as a reward for logistical reasons we're unable to offer new backers the book. Instead we're offering potential backers postcards, prints and a calendar featuring our favourite photos! You can choose from any of the photos in our Kickstarter campaign and we'll also send you a PDF of images to select from once you've chosen your reward.\nSpread the love\nYou can follow us on Instagram and Facebook.

Thank you so much for your support!\nThe Voyager Golden Record was a gift from humanity to the cosmos. And it is also a gift to humanity.\nIn 1977, NASA launched two spacecraft, Voyager I and II, on a grand tour of the solar system and beyond, into the mysteries of interstellar space. Mounted to each of these spacecraft is a stunning golden phonograph record, an interstellar message to introduce our civilization to extraterrestrials who might encounter the probes, perhaps billions of years from now. \nThe Voyager Golden Record contains the story of Earth expressed in sounds, images, and science: Earth's greatest music from myriad cultures and eras, from Bach and Beethoven to Blind Willie Johnson and Chuck Berry, Senegalese percussion to Solomon Island panpipes. Dozens of natural sounds of our planet -- birds, a train, a baby's cry -- are collaged into a lovely audio poem called Sounds of Earth. There are spoken greetings in 55 human languages, and one whale language, and more than one hundred images encoded in analog that depict who, and what, we are.  (To hear those greetings and Sounds of Earth and see a handful of the images, visit NASA/JPL-Caltech's Voyager site!)\nEtched on the record\u2019s gold-plated aluminum jacket is a diagram explaining where it came from, and how to play it. \nAstronomer and science educator Carl Sagan chaired the visionary committee that created the original Voyager Golden Record forty years ago. Astronomer and SETI pioneer Frank Drake was the technical director, writer Ann Druyan was creative director, science writer Timothy Ferris produced the record, artist Jon Lomberg designed it, and artist Linda Salzman Sagan organized the greetings. \nVoyager I entered interstellar space in 2013. It\u2019s almost 13 billion miles away from Earth, and in about 40,000 years it will be within 1.6 light years of a star in the constellation of Camelopardalis. Voyager II is right on its tail. We may never know whether an extraterrestrial civilization ever listens to the Golden Record. \nBut now for the first time in history, to celebrate Voyager's 40th anniversary next year, you'll be able to experience it for yourself the way it was meant to be played.\nAn exquisitely-designed objet d'art, this limited edition Voyager Golden Record: 40th Anniversary Edition vinyl box set will only be available through this Kickstarter. It is the ultimate album package of the ultimate album package.\nThe cloth-covered box with gold foil inlay will house three, heavyweight translucent gold vinyl LPs protected by poly-lined paper sleeves. The LPs will contain all of the same magnificent music, greetings, and sounds as contained on the original Voyager Golden Record, nearly two hours of audio. (Track list below.) Those records will slip into old style tip on, black ink and gold foil jackets. The audio will be complemented by a beautifully-designed hardbound book of captivating images from the original interstellar message, glorious photos of the planets returned to Earth from the Voyager probes, compelling essays, and ephemera from the project's history. \nEach set will include a color, plastic digital download card with a code to access all of the audio in MP3 or FLAC format. A lithograph of the iconic Golden Record cover diagram, printed with gold metallic ink on archival paper, high-quality enamel pin of that same diagram, and a custom turntable slipmat featuring NASA/JPL-Caltech's heliocentric view of the Voyager spacecrafts' trajectories across the solar system will complete the box set.\nWe are honored that Timothy Ferris, the original producer of the Golden Record, will be in the recording studio with us to remaster the audio for vinyl, drawing from the highest-quality sources we can access.\nThe overwhelming majority of the funds raised from this historic reissue will go directly to the high production costs, licensing, and royalties incurred in creating this lavish box set. All manufacturing, except perhaps the vinyl pressing, will take place in North America at highly-respected facilities using the finest materials.\nWe are excited about some very special plans we have for the net proceeds from this project.

Or as vegan cookbooks with illustrations of sad rock stars drowning their sorrows in food. Either way, you'll laugh, cry, and learn to make some really tasty recipes.\nAbout the Books:\n  Defensive Eating with Morrissey: Vegan Recipes From the One You Left Behind is a book of beautiful portraits of Smiths star Moz hoarding food; each portrait is accompanied by a poetic vegan recipe, so that you can eat what Morrissey is eating.\nThe praise is already rolling in! \"To dine on these sides is such a heavenly way to dine,\" declaims Wes Allison, co-author of The Taco Cleanse.\nComfort Eating with Nick Cave: Vegan Recipes to Get Deep Inside of You contains portraits of Mr. Cave crying and eating those salty, noodly, cheezy staples that we all crave when we're sad\u2014with recipes for every one.\nWhat's the story behind these unusual books? We asked artist Automne Zingg to write an introduction.\nAutomne's Story:\nIn 2013 I was broke, living in Los Angeles, and going through a terrible breakup. It was probably one of the darkest times in my life and I felt inconsolable. I wasn't working. I wasn't eating. I wasn't drinking. I wasn't doing much of anything except writing depressing songs and listening to even more depressing ones from my youth. I found it curious that the bands that got me through the general malaise of being a sad teenage goth served as a type of sonic comfort food for me as an even sadder adult. Was I having a midlife crisis? The only thing that brought me comfort during this nightmare was drawing. I started to doodle images of Nick Cave crying over pints of ice cream, Siouxsie Sioux devouring tacos, and The Sisters Of Mercy stuffing their faces with Cinnabons. The more time passed, the more surreal these drawings became.\nNick Cave was a particular go to for me during this time and he became the musical equivalent to my grandmother's lasagna. I devoured his music and binge listened for months. It was familiar and comforting; I thought whatever feeling emotional eaters gained from consuming a pint of ice cream, I got from blasting \"Your Funeral...My Trial.\" As heartbroken as I was, I reminded myself that Nick Cave had been through much worse. I wondered what he did during those trying times and found myself unconsciously doodling pictures of him weeping while eating. Each day the drawings got a little weirder and my mood got a little better.\nEventually I started sharing them with others and everyone wanted to see Morrissey putting things in his mouth. Who wouldn't? I obliged and started doing a series of drawings of Morrissey hoarding food.\nNom nom nom. Boo hoo hoo.\nxoxo Automne Zingg\nWe fell in love with Automne's drawings, and asked Joshua Ploeg to write a recipe to go with each one. The spectacular results are here for you to see!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThese books are sturdy hardcovers without dustjackets (the industry term is \"paper over board\"). They'll hold up to a lot of sad tears, exuberant tears, and kitchen spills. We're Kickstarting them for two reasons: \n1) The world needs to know.\n2) We're committed to printing in the US. Most color books are printed more cheaply in China and then priced artificially low for consumers\u2014so we are raising funds in order to pay for the printing without risking our building and staff, and to keep the price manageable for you, the reader.\nBy backing this project, you help us make an awesome book (and keep making more in the future!), you support manufacturing in the US midwest, and you get to never stop laughing. Win!\nFrom the Moz cookbook\n  From the Cave cookbook\n  About the artist\nThe artist at work\nArtist Automne Zingg originated the internet trend of drawings of goths eating things. Drawing these pictures started as a breakup remedy.... then things escalated. When not drawing, she makes video art and performs music as Lacey Spacecake. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.\nAbout the chef\nYour chef in action\nJoshua Ploeg travels the world cooking vegan food for a wide diversity of parties and causes. He's the author of many vegan cookbooks, most recently This Ain't No Picnic: Your Punk Rock Vegan Cookbook. When not cooking, he sings in punk bands: currently Select Sex, and previously in pioneering queercore bands like Mukilteo Fairies and Behead the Prophet.\nAbout the publisher\nOur store at work!\n  Microcosm Publishing produces brightly-colored books that empower readers to improve their lives and change the world. Inspired by the ethics and aesthetics of punk rock, we've been scrappy and independent since 1996. With our staff of ten and almost 400 titles and 2 million books in print, we still come to work at our Portland, Oregon office and have the most fun every day. \nWe run Kickstarter projects for some of our books for two reasons: So more people can find our books and be delighted and inspired by them, and to pay the bills.

So why Kickstarter? Printing is one of the biggest costs in publishing, and to put out two books at once is a real financial challenge. That's why we're running this campaign!\n\nThere's always the possibility that one of the fine gentlemen lovingly parodied in these books will sue us into oblivion. We ran a fine-toothed legal comb through the books and even asked both Morrissey and Cave point blank if they'd object ... or if they wanted to be involved in the books (Cave's agents graciously declined to be involved; no response from Moz's people). This is America and anyone can sue anyone for anything. But parody is protected under fair use and we think we're well protected.\n\nThe biggest challenge we expect to face is: Will we make our goal? These two books are drawn, written, formatted, edited, layed-out, paperworked, publicized, and basically completely ready to go to print. We've invested a lot in these already.

Today inspires a sense of renewal, calm, and perhaps most importantly, balance.\nMe with an early prototype of Today (underneath my first Kickstarter project, ThePresent), mid-September 2015\nToday has helped me regulate my sleep patterns and resonate with the idea that every day is a gift. \nTODAY 5\" Desk Clock & 11\" Wall Clock\nI'm on Kickstarter to share this powerful timepiece with you because I'm confident that living with Today will do the same or something similarly profound for you.\nWhat the press is saying about Today\n\"Today is a revolutionary gift to the world.\"  Huffington Post\n\"See the day in a whole new light.\"  Techcrunch\n\"It's a simple but effective perspective shift that can change how you think about your waking hours in a way that makes it seem like you've been magically handed more time.\"  AIGA - Eye on Design\nDesign inspiration  \nThe design of the face tries to capture that feeling of wonder you get when you look out at the clouds passing by from 30,000 ft. My hope is that Today brings the limitless potential you feel up there, down here.\nWhat inspires me.\nThe spectrum of time\nToday is the spiritual follow-up to my first Kickstarter project, ThePresent, the 365-day clock that reframes your perception of the year.\nMy first Kickstarter project, ThePresent\nThe creative adventure of producing, distributing, and giving talks about ThePresent gradually opened my mind to seeing time as a spectrum.\nThink of it this way: on one end of the \u201cspectrum of time\u201d you have the standard clock that reveals every second of every minute of every hour at a glance.\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, we find ThePresent.\nAs a balancing corrective between these two points on the \"spectrum of time\" is Today, a timepiece that reveals the entire day at a glance.\nYour day at a glance.\nLet's start Today\nI've brought three different styles of prototypes to 90% and I need your support and input to finalize the finishing touches and push this project to completion.\nPictured below are the final prototypes of Today, available in 3 different constructions. \nTODAY - 5\" Desk Clock - Bamboo - $88\nTODAY - 5\" Desk Clock - Bamboo\nTODAY - 11\" Wall Clock  -  Bamboo - $118\nTODAY - 11\" Wall Clock - Bamboo (showing 3pm)\nTODAY - 11\"  Steel and Glass Wall Clock - $158 \nTODAY - 11\" Steel and Glass Wall Clock\nWe are also offering ThePresent, my first Kickstarter project, as a reward bundle option.\nThe bottom 4 rewards to your right contain ThePresent as a bundle option.\nOwn the Present (you really can, as a reward bundle).\nToday specs\nDiameter \nBamboo Desk Clock: 5\" in diameter and 1.5\" deep.\nBamboo Wall Clock: 11\" and 1.5\" deep. \nSteel and Glass Wall Clock: 11\u201d in diameter and 2.25\u201d deep. \nThe edge of the bamboo clock is beautifully finished and meets the edge of the clock face precisely\nWeight: \nBamboo Desk Clock: 1.0 lbs.\nBamboo Wall Clock: 1.4 lbs.\nSteel and Glass Wall Clock: 2.0 lbs.\nBattery life\nRequires two AA batteries. \nDesigned to run for a minimum of 3 years.\nToday takes regular AA batteries and will last at least 3 years until you need to change them\nI've stress tested the supply chain for Today with the same local team of highly skilled craftsmen and women locally in Brooklyn, USA that I worked with to produce thousands of editions of ThePresent.\n\nFrom a plane.\n\nMaking time\nYour pledge will fund the final stages of production:\n\nProduction of all Steel and Glass and Bamboo Clocks in the USA\nTransporting all components to and from vendors to final assembly\nTooling costs for smaller hand to be used in the Desk Clock\nTooling costs for branding \"Today\" into steel battery backplate\nPerfecting the highest quality print to last for decades\nPost Kickstarter e-commerce site design and build\nEngineering and assembly of the movement itself\nQuality control, fulfillment, handling and shipping\nTime and small staff to help bring Today to life\nPackaging design, prototyping, and execution\nAssembly of the clocks and quality control\nKickstarter and Stripe processing fees\nMOQ for the custom domed glass cover\nContingency\nMy Kickstarter goal is modest. The pricing is structured so that if we hit and go over the goal, we are equipped to deliver the clocks by December 2016. After running two successful campaigns, I am confident that your clocks will be delivered on time and on budget. \n\nThe Today fam.\n\nBacking this project will give you a front row seat to the finishing touches and full scale production of Today. I love making videos, and I'm excited to document and share the process with you. \n  Why make Today?\nToday is primarily inspired by living with ThePresent. After raising the initial funding with the help of 837 backers with the first Kickstarter, I've produced and distributed over 3,000 editions of ThePresent. Owners in 48 countries now live with ThePresent.   \n\n\nSideview of ThePresent with Bamboo construction.\nI never imagined myself as someone who introduces new scales of time, but I can't imagine being involved in anything more urgent, meaningful, and rewarding. The way we measure time dictates our behavior and so we deserve access to scales that are more appropriate for the way we live our lives now and far into the future.\n\nI see a world that is less anxious and more grateful about time. A world where time is not an enemy, or money, or something we find new ways to kill. I feel a pull to use technology to positively impact our collective quality of life. \n\nThat view.\n\nThe meditative simplicity of dawn, noon, dusk and midnight was the only way we related to time for tens of thousands of years before modern clocks were popularized during the industrial revolution.\n\nWe are well into the information revolution and yet we have not updated the way we measure time.\n \nNearly everything has changed, except how we measure time. \n\nWe have the chance to change that together, Today.\n\n  What people are saying about ThePresent\n\"It's a beautiful clock that I am proud to have on my wall.\"\n\n\"It helps me find some grounding, or a moment of reflection, a good thought, a deep breath...\"\n\"A subtle reminder to be present throughout the day.\"\n\u201cThis is seriously one of my favorite things. Besides the iPhone, I don't think I've ever been impacted this hard by anything I've ever owned...it's art.\u201d\n\"It is a gentle reminder to breathe.\"\n\"ThePresent removed the borders, the constraints. It's a ballerina's pirouette, a swan's glide, a wind with no beginning or end.\"\n\"It grounds me and shows me where I am in time.\"\nTalking about time.\nWhat the press is saying about ThePresent\n\"It\u2019s all about encouraging us to experience time as a natural, contiguous slipstream, instead of something to stress out about having too little (or too much) of in arbitrary chunks.\" \u2013\u2013 Fast Company\n\n\"Anti-Anxiety Object, ThePresent is a very special clock.\" \u2013\u2013  ArtInfo\n\n\"One of the most Zen clocks we've seen.\" \u2013\u2013 Coolhunting\n\n\"Have you ever felt like time is moving too fast?

We want 750 NEW backers in 15 days. That means 50 backers every day. If you are reading this, today YOU are one of those 50! \nEvery backer counts regardless of the amount. \nUltimately we want this film to get out to at least 250 communities across the country and around the world. That won't happen on its own. \nHelp us get the word out and demonstrate to potential broadcasters, festival producers, and distributors that this film has an engaged and active following. \nIn the film world the rule of thumb is that you should spend as much on outreach and distribution as you do on production. That may be true for larger films without an already engaged audience, but we believe this budget combined with our grassroots network of supporters will ensure this film gets out into the hands of those who need to see it. \nWe will use funds raised for the following:\nDiscussion Guide \nOutreach \nPublicity \nUpdated and Interactive Website \nFinal sound edit and mix \nFestival submission fees \nDeliverables (DVDs, etc.)\nKickstarter Fees and Rewards\nWe have made a great film with the potential to impact the health of women and families around the world. \nAfter a few finishing touches the next step is getting it out! That's what this campaign is all about.\nTo guide us along the way, we are working with Film Sprout, a group with extensive experience in grassroots distribution for independent social issue documentaries.\nWe want to create meaningful discussions about maternity care where it is happening, in communities. We believe that it will take action across settings and stakeholders to create significant and lasting change. \nWe have positioned this film in a way that speaks across the traditional divisions in maternity care. \nTogether, we can increase understanding and access to choices. We can move toward real improvements in maternity care, improvements that benefit women, families, and society whether they choose to give birth at home, hospital, or birthing center. \nPlease don't wait. Join us today and show your support. \nThank you!\nJessicca and the \"Why Not Home?\" Team\n Fiscally sponsored by:\nIf you're wondering what kind of impact this film could have, just watch this first year med student's reaction after watching the first 20 minutes. \nWe think community birth should be part of the curriculum at medical and nursing schools.

AGFA exists to preserve the legacy of genre movies through collection, conservation, and distribution.\nAGFA HQ.\nFormed in 2009, AGFA focuses on outlaw exploitation movies that were produced from the 1960s through the 1990s. From manic hicksploitation epics to bloodthirsty shoestring goreblasts, each title in AGFA's collection is a celebration of culture that should never be forgotten. Housing over six thousand 35mm film prints and trailers, our non-profit archive counts among its board members and advisors Alamo Drafthouse founders Tim and Karrie League, filmmakers Nicolas Winding Refn and Paul Thomas Anderson, and Austin area film programmers and movie fans.\nThe late Mike Vraney, founder of Something Weird.\nMike Vraney founded Something Weird Video in 1990. Sadly, he passed away in 2014 after a long, heroic battle with lung cancer. Legendary exploitation warlock David F. Friedman deemed Vraney \"the forty-first thief,\" which was the ultimate compliment to this exploiteer. Vraney dedicated his life to unearthing and preserving the most radically insane exploitation and horror movies of all time. He introduced multiple generations to the works of Herschell Gordon Lewis, Doris Wishman, David F. Friedman, Barry Mahon, Michael and Roberta Findlay, and Fredric C. Hobbs. Vraney's contribution to preserving the world's most deranged cultural milestones can never be overstated. Something Weird Video changed the way that we understand movies.\nNow it's our turn to give something back.\nAGFA has started working with Something Weird\u2019s Lisa Petrucci, Mike Vraney\u2019s widow and partner, to redistribute titles from the massive 35mm film collection.\nVraney\u2019s hard work should never be forgotten. And access is a crucial part of preservation. The movies that Something Weird unearthed are meant to be played. These movies come to life when audiences enjoy them. Each year, AGFA loans hundreds of prints to arthouse institutions, film societies, festivals, libraries, and universities. A fundamental component of our mission is to make sure that people watch these movies. But film prints have a limited lifespan. Like human beings, all prints are inevitably headed to the dumpster. However, with proper storage and care, we can prolong the lives of these prints and ensure that the movies themselves endure the ravages of time. In order to share these treasures, AGFA is undertaking a new initiative.\nOur mission is to raise completion funds for a 4K film scanner to digitally transfer original film elements from the Something Weird collection, as well as one-of-a-kind obscurities in the AGFA archive.\nAGFA will partner with Drafthouse Films -- the distribution arm of the Alamo Drafthouse -- to share these movies in theaters, on home video, and on VOD platforms. While AGFA is dedicated to 35mm preservation, we also want to make sure that these movies are accessible to as many people as possible.\nThe first title that AGFA will preserve from the Something Weird collection is Tom Hanson's THE ZODIAC KILLER. Released in 1971, the movie was made in hopes of capturing the real-life Zodiac Killer. The plan didn\u2019t work. Instead, we got the most outrageous and compelling \u201ctabloid horror\u201d vortex in the history of planet Earth. And beyond.\nDid you know that the Zodiac Killer wore Groucho glasses while stalking his victims? Did you know that the Zodiac\u2019s pet rabbits commanded him to kill during black mass rituals? Did you also know that the Zodiac might have been a man named Grover who attempted to kidnap his daughter while brandishing a hand saw? You won\u2019t get insight like this by watching a David Fincher movie. But you will get it while watching THE ZODIAC KILLER.\nBalancing cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 grimness with outta-this-world absurdity, THE ZODIAC KILLER is an ultra-bizarro time capsule and a crown jewel in the Something Weird treasure chest. It is AGFA's duty to preserve incredible works like this. THE ZODIAC KILLER is peerless. It deserves to be seen. Forever.\nTo make this happen, we need your help.\nHead archivist Sebastian del Castillo inspects a print at AGFA HQ.\nThe American Genre Film Archive exists because of a tangible need. AGFA has saved 35mm film prints from landfills, incinerators, and from being literally tossed into the ocean. Every act of heroism that goes into the maintenance of the collection is done by people who believe in AGFA and the future of exploitation film preservation. All of the work at AGFA happens on a shoestring -- or no-shoestring -- budget. If you love movies, you love AGFA . . . even if you've never heard of it. If you recognize the inherent fun of movies, AGFA is probably the only archive out there that feels the same way.\nSo step forward, fellow weirdos!\nNOW IS THE TIME TO ACT!\nHelp AGFA keep the legacy of Something Weird Video alive for all eternity! Or at least the next few hundred years.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have no doubt that the support of likeminded genre movie enthusiasts will allow us to actualize this labor of love.

I've never seen a game concept so beautifully designed around systems thinking and evidence-backed decision-making.\" - Bret Victor, iPad UI concept designer\n\"Eco is one of the most ambitious and original concepts I've seen in a while.\" - Jeffrey Matulef, EuroGamer.net\n\"[Other games] don't encourage the kind of ethical decision making that will be required of future pioneers. Perhaps ECO can offer a solution.\" - Jordan Shapiro, Forbes.com\n\"Eco will help the next wave of decision-makers understand the impact of their choices on the environment, climate, and biosphere. Eco is beautiful, ambitious and important.\" - Kenneth Karakotsios, creator of Sim Life\nEnter the world of Eco,\nwhere you must collaborate to build civilization in a finite shared world, using resources from a fully simulated ecosystem where your every action affects the lives of countless species.\nWill you and your fellow citizens collaborate successfully, creating laws to guide the actions of the group, finding a balance that takes resources from the ecosystem without damaging it? Or will the world be destroyed by short-sighted choices that pollute the environment in exchange for immediate resource gains? Or, do players act too slowly, and the world is consumed by a disaster that could have been avoided if you developed the right technology? In Eco, you must find a balance as a group if the world is to survive.\nA Global Survival Game.\nEco is a survival game in a global sense, where it is not just the individual or group who is threatened, but the world itself. The world of Eco will be home to a population of thousands of simulated plants and animals, each living out their lives on a server running 24 hours a day, growing, feeding and reproducing, with their existence highly dependent on other species.\nEnter humans into this equation, \nand things get complicated. It is the role of players to thrive in this environment by using resources from the world to eat, build, discover, learn and invent.\nHowever, every resource they take affects the environment it is taken from, and without careful planning and understanding of the ecosystem, lands can become deforested and polluted, habitats destroyed, and species left extinct.\nIn the extreme, the food supply of the ecosystem can be destroyed, along with all human life on it, resulting in server-wide perma-death. Eco is a game where the player\u2019s actions have meaningful consequences.\nA Player-Run Government\nTaking resources from an ecosystem to build within it without destroying it is no easy task, and you\u2019ll need to make decisions as a group to do so. Fortunately you\u2019ve got some tools to do so.\n Players can propose, discuss, and vote on laws, and passed laws will affect everyone, physically preventing them from breaking the law. \nThe ecosystem data is visible to players. Players can gather full data on the ecosystem simulation in-game, allowing them to analyze what\u2019s happening in the world and how the ecosystem works. This data can be used to construct arguments for laws, backing up the player-run government with hard scientific data. \nConstructing a city\nEco is a voxel world that can be completely transformed as players mine and build, and unlike other voxel games where buildings are purely decorative, buildings will have effects in Eco. When a player constructs a building, they can designate its type (whether its a home, school, lumber mill, bakery, etc). If it meets the criteria (size and construction material) it will then give special abilities to anyone who occupies it. For example, players who construct a home will see their food depletion rate go down by 70% if they logout inside it. Other buildings will be required to process resources (lumber mill, bakery), provide access to tools (mine, well) or increase the rate skills are learned (school, library).\nUnlike other voxel games, building will be a complex task in Eco, requiring a range of skills from multiple players to construct. Resources must be harvested (wood cutting, masonry), processed (wood working), transported (animal labor), and constructed (carpentry, construction). It will not be possible for one player to specialize in all the skills necessary to build in Eco, collaboration is required.\nPlayer-Run Economy\nThis emphasis on collaboration within Eco creates many interesting multiplayer effects, as players choose skills to specialize in.  The only way to have work done across multiple specialties is to collaborate, and all high-level goals in Eco will require multiple types of skills. \nSupporting this will be a player created economy which players can use to sell goods and services. Unlike most games which only allow players to sell items, Eco allows players to sell contracts for labor, which the game will enforce. Need someone to build you a house?  Take out a contract and they will complete the job, with payment being held in escrow until completion. This system of contracts forms our 'quest' system, where a quest is an actual job needed by another real human in the game, which your player has the specialized skills necessary to complete.  Through specialization and game-enforced exchanges and contracts, a rich economy will develop in Eco that forms the basis of all resource allocation.\nTraining skills and Food\nPlayers will have skills in a variety of areas that determine their abilities in the game, and a single skill be increased at a constant rate of time. This rate is multiplied by how healthy and well-fed a player is, thus raising the need for an agricultural industry within the world. While most games treat food as something you must simply top-up periodically in the game, Eco ties it to skill advancement, so the nutrition of the food you eat determines how fast you increase in skill. Eat very little or only junk? Your skills will remain stagnant. Eat high quality and nutritious food? Your skills will raise at a multiplied rate.\nPlayers who specialize in skills related to food harvesting, farming, and preparation, and then give or sell that food to their fellow players will have a tremendous impact on the overall skill rate of players and thus survival of the world. Food is not an after thought in Eco but a key industry required for success, and tied deeply to the ecosystem from which it must be harvested, making farming and hunting as well as food processing and preparation pivotal skills. \nResearching Technology\nPlayers begin the game with just a few technologies and buildings they can access. To acquire more, they must perform research. Players research by performing experiments, an action they can do in the game in special buildings with specific tools that will consume resources. Multiple players can contribute experiments to a common cause, and when enough experiments have been performed a knowledge object will be unlocked.\nKnowledge objects are owned by those that performed the research, and they may be shared for a price or freely to anyone they wish (they never get consumed), with each player using a knowledge object getting access to new skills they can train, new buildings they can construct, and new research they can take on. \nAs players gain in knowledge they gain in power, with players in a fresh world starting off relatively weak but growing to have the capability for huge influence on the world and ecosystem, which can lead to triumph or ruin depending on how they use those abilities. \nLaws\nAs the level of technology available to players increases, the capability for affecting the environment increases exponentially. To ensure players use this power positively, players must construct laws. Players can propose laws backed by scientific data they take from the ecosystem, using sophisticated graphs and wiki toolsets to make discussions and decisions about the future of the world a seamless activity for players. \nThere is no guide book to how to sustainably use the resources of the ecosystem, players must understand it by looking at the actual data themselves, and convince their fellow players of what they believe. As players have different specialties in the game, their incentives will be influenced heavily by their livelihood, just as in the real world (a lumberjack player may be less inclined to halt deforestation than the general population because their livelihood depends on it). \nThus, even though players are working together towards a common goal, their individual incentives and desires will guide their decisions in conflicting way, and navigating that Tragedy of the Commons through laws and scientific evidence to achieve success and avoid ruin is the core experience we plan to provide with Eco. \nEnd of World Scenarios\nBesides the threat of destroying the ecosystem of the world through pollution and habitat destruction, the world of Eco is threatened with another catastrophe, set via options at server creation. A meteor may be striking the earth, with the groups only chance of survival to develop technology to prevent it. Or a drought may be imminent, and food and water must be conserved in anticipation. Global warming may be raising the sea levels, and players will have to adapt. In Eco, the threats to the world\u2019s existence are not only internal (player destruction of the ecosystem) but external as well, giving players an additional incentive.\nThere is no easy moral lesson here, and entirely avoiding harm to the ecosystem in Eco is not a solution, resources must be collected from the world at the short term expense of the ecosystem if it\u2019s going to survive in the long term. These will be expert scenarios that only a large well-governed group of players will be able to overcome . \nHosting Servers and Single player\nPlayers will be able to host their own servers, and the game can be played single player if so desired. The size of the world can be scaled, and the rate of learning increased in these scenarios so players can try their hand at building on their own in an isolated world, surrounded only with plants and animals of the wilderness.\nModding\nWe want to build Eco into more than just a single game, but a platform for many experiences.  From alpha access onwards, we will have full modding support, with a modding API.  Mods will be well-integrated into the final game, with downloads happening automatically, sent from each individual server.  We intend to open up the technology we're building to create a new class of game: large, dynamic, multiplayer worlds with continuous simulations running, in which the physical, social, economic, and government structure are all under player control.  The possibilities for games like this is barely explored, and with Eco as a platform we can provide a launch pad for creating them.\nStretch Goals\nWith Eco funded, we can start thinking about stretch goals! \nOur first stretch goal at 150k is a land ownership system, taxation, building rights. Read about it in this update.\nOur second stretch goal has changed!  At 200k, we will implement a Player-Run Criminal Justice System.  Check it out in this update.\nMore stretch goals to come!  \nDevelopment\nThis is game we plan to develop in close tandem with a community of players, and shortly after the Kickstarter completes we will open the game to backer-only early access. Backers at the appropriate tiers will have full access to all aspects of development, with an open Trello account detailing what each team member is working on, open source art and code for most of the game, and the ability to host your own server. We will rely on our backers to give feedback on the mechanics as we develop them, playing a pivotal role in the creation of the game. \nAdditionally, Eco will have very fully integrated modding support, with drag-and-drop plugin support while the server runs, and a web-interface for configuring a running server. \nWhat we\u2019ve created already\nHere's what we've already created in the game:\nMultiplayer server hosting a voxel world, supporting up to several dozen players simultaneously. \nDynamic simulated ecosystem featuring 10 species of plants and animals that runs tens of thousands of organisms simultaneously in real time, each feeding, growing, hunting, fleeing, and reproducing using AI behaviors. \nPlayer mechanics for tool usage, inventory, skill training, food, farming, building, hunting, digging, lumberjacking, etc \nBuilding detection system, buildings give special abilities \nLaw proposal, discussions and votings through a browser interface to the server \nGraphs of all data of the ecosystem exposed to web tools to gather and integrate them into laws \nCustom graphics engine to create voxel pieces based on surrounding area, allowing more detailed houses, landscapes, and plants (not limited to cubes) \nDetailed mod support, allowing the server to be extended by players\nStore system, allowing both goods and services to be securely sold\nFollowing the Kickstarter, we will make a version available for alpha-tier backers for our alpha test, targeting October.  Players will be able to host their own worlds and participate in development.\nWhat we\u2019ll be adding\nUsing the funds from the Kickstarter, we will create a fully-featured commercial version, prioritizing the following features: \nLarger and more diverse ecosystem, more detailed AI behaviors for species \nMore buildings, skills, foods, skills, technologies, and tools for players to use \nService sales, allowing players to sell contracts to perform services using their specialized skills (quest system).\nPlayer server controls, allowing players to host games and control who can join \nEnd-of-world scenarios (such as impending meteor strike) offering expert-level challenges to the game\nOver the course of the next 16 months we plan to develop the game extremely closely with the community, integrating their feedback and contributions at every step.  From there we plan to extend the game and continue adding support for players and modders, fostering a community of development surrounding the game.\nBudget\nThe budget from the Kickstarter will go towards building out the consumer features of the game, making it work for a mass audience, and adding specific features with our stretch goals.  A rough breakdown is as follows:\nServer technology and modding - 23% \nGameplay programming - 31% \nArtwork and animation - 24% \nSound, misc - 12% \nWeb development - 5% \nBacker rewards - 5% \nTeam\nOur team is composed of game industry veterans, from the studio that created the liquid physics game Vessel, the cell biology game Sim Cell. Team members have more than a collective 50 years experience in the games industry, including projects like Lord of the Rings on PlayStation, the Dark Knight for console, the Microsoft Holo Lens, and dozens of other console titles. Our team has a solid history of delivering extremely technically challenging projects on time and budget. \nCore team:\nJohn Krajewski - Project lead and designer of Eco. Prior to founding Strange Loop Games, worked as Lead AI Programmer at Electronic Arts.  Programmer of the liquid physics simulation of Vessel.  Also served as project lead on Sim Cell, Codebreakers, Scribbly Wits.  John's focus is on programming and designing for detailed simulations (AI, Physics, Ecology, Social, etc).\nMilenko Tunjic - Art director.  Founder at Strange Loop, Milenko has been art director on every project we've shipped, and has more than 20 years experience in the games industry.\nEric Anderson - Tech director.  Prior to Strange Loop, worked as a technical developer on the Microsoft Hololens project.  Winner of the 2004 IGF for Bontago. Eric comes from a long history in the console and PC games industry, including Surreal/Midway/Warner Brothers with numerous titles shipped.\nTeam members made possible with Kickstarter funds include:\nKeegan O'Rourke, technical artist\nNicholas Fuller, programmer and modding system developer\nKi-Kyeong Lim, programmer and Unity specialist\nKen Tan, physics and player interaction programmer\nHsi-Hung Shih, AI specialist and marmot lover\nA team at the University of Illinois helped us create the prototype and design and build a simulated ecosystem model.  Going forward we will be working with other partners for performing research, science design, and testing on Eco.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nEco is an extremely community-focused game, and by going with Kickstarter for our funding we place that community at the center of development, and work directly with them to make the game a reality.\nWe've already been Greenlit on Steam after only 8 days, and we plan to support the game through the Steam platform for both alpha and beta testing as well as the final product.\nBacker Rewards\nBackers at the $65 level and above (except $125) will get a 24\"x36\" poster of the Eco concept art with their order:\n Backers at the $135 level and above will get a limited edition Eco T-shirt:\nPledge Add-ons        \n                                               Backers can add value to their pledge to purchase additional digital copies, for every $35 additional they pledge above their tier they will receive an additional alpha/beta copy.\n Classroom Use   \n  We believe games are the most powerful medium of our age, and that by playing Eco players will have an experience that will be incredibly meaningful in how they think about the finite resources of our actual environment. For that reason, we plan to build Eco with special support for classrooms, including a set of tools for teachers to get a high-level view of exactly what is happening in the game and foster discussion. The game functions as 'homework' with the whole class logging into a shared world form home to build and collaborate, and using the classroom time as the council meeting, where discussions and decisions about this shared world take place.\nBelow is a video detailing the prototype we built and tested for classroom use and used for our grant application, featuring a partnership during the prototype with the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  Going forward we will be continuing research and testing with other academic partners.\nWe believe games have the potential to make a huge difference globally, and that the power of play can transform the world. We hope you agree and support our goals as we work to redefine what games can be.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've completed a prototype build, and are working towards an alpha which backers at the $30 tier and above can expect in October. Beyond that, risks to the project include:\n\n- Difficulty scaling 100+ users. If this stretch goal is achieved we plan to tackle this by splitting the server into multiple areas and running them connected. We will collaborate with middleware companies that offer existing technology for hosting massive worlds.\n\n- Ecosystem balance. Creating a balanced ecosystem where each individual is simulated is a challenge, but our team is very experienced with simulations, having created multiple physics and AI simulations, and we will continue to work with ecologists to guide development using ecological principles. We plan to develop the server such that time can be run in fast-forward, allowing us to rapidly test and iterate on ecosystem design.\n\n- Player interactions. The quality of the game relies on group interaction, and that will matter a lot on who you're playing with. We have experience designing a player-generated-content game Scribbly Wits and managing trolling users to create a strong and positive community, and we will apply the same principles to Eco. Furthermore, through the law-creation feature of the game players will be able to define what is allowed within the group themselves and what punishments should be given to those that break the laws.\n\nLike any project, there will be issues and challenges that come up, and through our open development we plan to work these out with the community, seeking feedback with each change. Our company has a history of taking on very technical challenging projects, and with the support of the Department of Education (which gave us a grant to develop the game) we have shown we can deliver on the foundations of the game on time and budget.

You choose! \nCheck out the links below for some reviews and opinions on Tawny Goods!\nGear Gent Review - 9.4 out 10 \nThe Sharp Suit\nFashionista Chicago\nAn Acute Style\nThe Made Shop\nAll of our Goodyear welted boots and shoes are made with 100% full-grain leather, both inside and out, with a leather sole. We use the highest quality construction, with the best materials, on our versions of classic American and European style boots and shoes. \nOur boots and shoes come in whole sizes, from US men's 7-12.\nUPDATED  - Due to a number of requests, we have expanded our sizes to include men's size 7.\nPledge $150 to receive a pair, $275 for two pairs, as well as other deals in the Rewards section.\nWingtips were created to serve a very specific purpose in Scottish and Irish bogs. Perforations in the leather allowed water to escape the shoes when wet, helping them dry quickly and evenly. Brogueing, as it is traditionally called, allows for ventilation that keeps feet cool in the summer, yet still warm in the harsh winters of the UK and Ireland.\nPledge $150 to receive a pair, $275 for two pairs, as well as other deals in the Rewards section.\nThe Toe Cap Boot is an American and British classic that is built to last. Traditional Oxford-style shoes originated in Scotland and Ireland, and they slowly became one of the most popular styles of shoes in the world. When we think of classic workwear, we think of toecaps.\nPledge $150 to receive a pair, $275 for two pairs, as well as other deals in the Rewards section.\nOur Chukkas are classic English to the core. First brought over from India by the British Raj, the shoes get their name from the game of Polo (the one with horses) but were later worn by British Forces during WWII, when they were trudging across the Western Desert. What began as a sporting shoe for men who could afford to use horses for sport, later became the boot of choice for military men who had a job to get done.\nPledge $125 to receive a pair, $225 for two pairs, as well as other deals in the Rewards section.\nLike our Wingtip Boots, these shoes were originally designed with perforations to allow for much faster drying time after a day spent trudging through the bogs and moors of Scotland. The holes or \u201cbrogueing\u201d would drain water caught in the shoe, and they would look great at the local pub where the workers would end their day with a whisky and a beer.\nPledge $125 to receive a pair, $225 for two pairs, as well as other deals in the Rewards section.\nThe modern loafer started life on the dairy farms of Norway, but they didn't begin to catch on in Europe and America until the 1930\u2019s. What began as a casual shoe, the loafer worked its way onto Ivy League campuses, where they first began donning their signature penny, and into more formal settings.\nOur shoe bags are hand sewn in Leon, Mexico, using local and traditional fabrics.

My name is Rob Decker and I'm a photographer and graphic artist with a love of the national parks and the stylistic designs created by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s and 40s. \nFor nearly 50 years I have explored America\u2019s national parks. And while I have fond memories of camping with family in Yosemite as a kid, my most amazing experience was in the summer of 1979, when I studied photography with Ansel Adams in Yosemite National Park when I was just 19.\nOver the years, I have taken thousands of photographs of the 23 national parks I have visited \u2013 so far. Now, I\u2019ve created an exclusive collection of graphic art posters to complement the original artwork of the WPA.\nABOUT THE NATIONAL PARK POSTER PROJECT\nThe National Park Poster Project is inspired by the posters created during the WPA era, when hundreds of artists were commissioned to create thousands of posters to stir the public\u2019s imagination for education, theater, health, safety and travel.\nAlthough this project is driven by inspiration to create iconic posters for all 59 national parks, it\u2019s also designed to remind us why our national parks \u2013 with their amazing landscapes, vibrant cultures, and rich history --are worth visiting and protecting.\nAnd now it\u2019s time to share those experiences and to continue the unfinished work of the original WPA poster project from 90 years ago.\nThe complete collection will include all 59 national parks. You can see the first six here and the remaining six will be released during the campaign! All 12 will be printed and shipped out in December\u2026in time to make perfect holiday gifts!\nMy hope is that you will become part of this historic endeavor.\nWith your support, I will finish the development of the first 12 posters and print a large enough quantity so I can provide them at a reasonable price. To make that happen, we need to raise $5K. The funds will go towards printing all 12 posters and mailing out the backer rewards.\nThe ultimate goal is to raise much more than that. And if we do, I will be able to create the first ever complete collection of graphic art posters of the national parks. The WPA wasn\u2019t able to finish their collection in the 1940s. But together we can.\nAnd, there\u2019s a lot to be done before the 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service on August 25th, 2016 when I expect to have all 59 completed.\nGIVING BACK\nWith the creation of the National Park Poster Collection, I will also give back. I am currently speaking with a number of the National Parks Associations to partner on how we can bring funds into the parks and help to keep them open and protected. But I need your support to do it.\nSo, here\u2019s how you can make this project come to life. First, back this campaign TODAY by choosing one of our rewards and pledging. Second, spread the word by clicking on the Facebook and Twitter links near the top of this page. Third, tell everyone you know: The awesome RV communities, the outdoor enthusiasts and national park fans, the weekend nature photographer and more...\nIn the meantime, my promise is to keep you updated with photos, videos and sneak peeks of the new poster designs to be included in The National Park Poster Project!\n                                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks to this project are few; the challenges are inspiring.\n\nThe risk is that our National Parks, which are so important on so many levels, are threatened every day. Yosemite is on fire! Glaciers are melting at a rapid pace. Acid rain continues its deadly impact. Budget cuts limit our ability to preserve and protect some of the most amazing places on earth. The risk is NOT capturing the amazing beauty and nature of these parks before they suffer even more.\n\nJust today, someone commented on my blog: \"As a fine artist (and primarily of landscape art), I derive untold inspiration from our National Park System. I make it a point to discover or re-discover one any time I travel, and can't wait for my next visit to a National Park!\"\n\nThe challenge will be to personally visit each National Park...and moreover...to capture that single, iconic image that accurately represents each and every one of these National Treasures. As an experienced photographer...this is a challenge I can't wait to tackle!\n\nI have been professionally involved in photography, graphic art and print projects for nearly 30 years. Since I will be responsible for creating all of the original images -- and then developing the photo-graphic images for each poster -- that aspect of the project is quite secure. And, I am already working with a printer in Boulder, Colorado, and we just printed a short run of posters, primarily as proofs, as we prepare for a larger print run.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "National Park Posters Link", "update_content": "Here's the correctly spelled link for the National Park Posters site!\nhttps://national-park-posters.com\nThanks!\nRob."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Announcing National Park Gear!", "update_content": "Five years ago, you helped me successfully launch the National Park Poster Project with just 10 national park posters.

While her writing is fierce and exposed, Joan herself is an incredibly private person. We have the privilege to know Joan as a subject and also as a member of our family. Our director, Griffin Dunne, has known Joan his entire life. Joining Griffin as co-director is award-winning filmmaker, Susanne Rostock.\nWe Tell Ourselves Stories In Order to Live traces the arc of Joan\u2019s life through her own writings, and in her own voice. Our film will tell Joan\u2019s story through passages she has chosen (and will read aloud) from her work, as her friends, family, colleagues and critics share their accounts of her remarkable life and writing. Patti Smith, Vanessa Redgrave, Allison Janney, Graydon Carter, Robert Silvers, and Bret Easton Ellis are just a few of the people we\u2019ll interview.\n  We want to honor Joan's language, to visualize the stories she tells, to put her words to picture. Joan\u2019s obsessive memory, and her sharp and unsettling observations, will be brought to life, using music and images\u2013rare and atmospheric film and stills that encapsulate her words. We will also be using rare archival from Joan\u2019s personal life and family history.\n\nWhy now\nIncredibly, this story has never been told. Now that we have the access, we must tell it. This is our chance to be Joan's witness. \nOur journey began a couple of years ago, when we shot Joan as part of a short video to accompany her book tour for Blue Nights.\nAfter hours of watching her read and reflect it became clear that we could not stop there\u2013we had to do something much larger and deeper. Storytelling was a way of enduring the potent rawness Joan experienced through life, and through loss. Now we must be the ones to preserve this. To preserve her legacy. \n\"I have felt compelled to write things since I was five years old... I write entirely to find out what I\u2019m thinking, what I\u2019m looking at, what I see and what it means. What I want and what I fear.\" \u2013Joan Didion \nWhy here\nWe have come to Kickstarter to reach as many people as possible. We believe in the Kickstarter community. \nNo gift is too small. When you donate, you are proving that there is a huge, hungry audience for a documentary about Joan. \nAnd by supporting this campaign, you are actually making this film with us.\nThe players\nAlongside Joan's presence throughout the film, notable artists, writers, and actors will be interviewed.\nSome include:\nPatti Smith. Vanessa Redgrave. Michelle Williams. Cameron Crowe. Annie Leibovitz. Michiko Kakutani. Anna Wintour. Bret Easton Ellis. Scott Rudin. Jann Wenner. Graydon Carter. Allison Janney. Robert Silvers. Liam Neeson. \nAnd many more.\n\"[Joan Didion] cut loose any fixed idea that I ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself.\"\n\u2013Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times\nOur goal\nSo far we have shot 60 hours of footage, primarily of Joan. Now we need to shoot key interviews as described in \"The players\" section above. \nJoan was a chronicler of her times, and that world is quickly disappearing.\nWho we are \nDirector Griffin Dunne is an accomplished actor, producer, and director.

Below is our original Kickstarter campaign, updated to reflect the latest.\nTHE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4) is a dystopian science fiction film set in the not-too-distant future. It is a low-fi sci-fi short, made in China, telling the story of a city on the brink of a water shortage through the eyes and interactions of four main characters: a woman, a man, a lover, and a water smuggler.\nHELLO, PEOPLE OF KICKSTARTER!\nMy name is Jason and for the longest time I wanted to make my own films, so I left my job and my home to fly from New York to a city I\u2019d never been to before, Beijing. I chose China for creative solitude because I\u2019m easily distracted and had heard the Internet would be blocked for me, perfect for writing. Next thing you know \u2026\nI\u2019M FINISHING A MOVIE CALLED THE SAND STORM \nBeijing felt like the future, not cool and sleek (that\u2019s Shanghai) but dim and gritty. \nThe story centers around human dramas within a city in turmoil.\nIt was the start of 2013, and all of China was about to shut down for the holidays. We had two weeks exactly to assemble our cast and crew or we would be forced into production limbo indefinitely. The weather fell below freezing and on a scale of 1-500 (smoggy days in Los Angeles register 60-90), pollution indexes hit a record 800. This was the climate in which we operated. \nWe shot under extreme circumstances, entirely in Chinese, independent all the way. No fundraising, just us. Eventually, we started crowd funding. Then we stopped. Then we started again.\nWHY KICKSTARTER? WHY NOW? WHY $33,000?\nOur plan has always been to release the finished film online, for free, to the world, but we need to pay for it.\nWe wanted roll-out of the movie to be as much of a revelation as possible so we agreed to delay crowdfunding until after we wrapped.  \nNOW WE NEED YOU because to finish the film, pay back everyone, and break even would require over 300% of our initial ask but, honestly, anything helps. Shutting down early would have stopped us cold in our tracks and left people unpaid. Restarting for less than a week means we have a unique opportunity to build a critical mass, together.\nWHAT IF WE EXCEED OUR KICKSTARTER GOAL?\nTHAT WOULD BE AMAZING!! If you fund this project beyond $33k, you\u2019ll help cover our remaining production expenses.\nNEW : Our first stretch goal was 1000 supporters, our second $88k, now it's how many people can come on board. Can we reach 2000?\nWe still have hard costs related to visual effects, sound design, music, mix, color correction, subtitles, festival submission fees, and \u2026 is your head spinning, too? Every contribution counts. Even now.\nWe went at it alone, building sets, renting equipment, hiring a local cast and crew \u2026 some payments were deferred, others covered by short-term loans.\nFINISHING THE SAND STORM\nThere won\u2019t be any WARS OVER WATER for at least a decade but this film can be ready in a matter of weeks.\nSo many wonderful people have helped make the impossible possible. Incredibly talented industry professionals (not just in Beijing, but in London, Shanghai, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, with credits ranging from \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d to \u201cLost in Translation\u201d) are donating their time and resources, scrambling to finish so we can project on the big screen at a film festival \u2026 and reach the world online.\nWE RECORDED AN ORIGINAL SCORE with a 28-piece string orchestra at London\u2019s landmark Abbey Road, a studio kept historically and acoustically identical to when the Beatles last used it. One performer (pictured) is playing the viola from \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d (sitting somewhere in the middle). We\u2019ll be sharing more details in a future update.\nNEW : As an additional thank you, all supporters of THE SAND STORM (all of you!) will receive a free digital download of the latest album by Philip Sheppard, our film\u2019s composer. He's collaborated in the past with James Lavelle, Jarvis Cocker, Jimmy Page, David Bowie (who\u2019s name may not begin with the letter J but who\u2019s real last name does: it\u2019s Jones), and conducted for the Olympic Games (Beijing and London). Hope you like it!\nALL THIS FOR A TEN MINUTE FILM?\nYes. \nYOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS SO MUCH\nWe kept our production discreet and for over a year told no one what we were up to \u2026 then we teased without spoiler alerts, mainly with backstage photos and clips from the cutting room floor \u2026 expect to see more during our final five days.\nYour support has made it all worthwhile.\nThanks (in advance, even for reading this far), and at the risk of sounding like every other Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re giving away special gifts connected with the project: SUPER ARTSY REWARDS \u2026 custom action figures (!!!) \u2026 access to behind-the-scenes footage \u2026 still frames \u2026 and other surprises. Hair.\nOUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ENTERTAIN\nEven today, water shortages, poor air quality, and information obstruction exist around the world. These complex issues provide the backdrop for an open-ended story, and our art house sci-fi short is the set-up for more to come (perhaps an eventual full-length feature film). But first, we need to finish the short.\nWhatever\u2019s next, it's going to be awesome, especially if we go at it together. We hope you will join in our adventure as we wrap and release THE SAND STORM.\n\u2013 \u2013 Thank you! \u2013 \u2013\nJason Wishnow and the entire \u6c99\u5c18\u66b4 Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE GOOD NEWS is we\u2019ve already wrapped principle photography (unusual for a lot of movies on Kickstarter) meaning the hard part is over. But we\u2019re not done yet. It\u2019s no longer a question of WHETHER we finish the film, but WHEN we finish, and that part is up to you! (UPDATE: release and reward delivery dates may be pushed slightly. We will keep you informed.)\n\nSpeaking of risks and challenges\u2026\n\nI OWE AN APOLOGY. Our Kickstarter campaign is back after vanishing for a month and I must navigate the choppy waters of crafting a singular explanation for both an audience of one in China and many others elsewhere in the world.\n\nDEAR AI WEIWEI: Recently, I erred as if THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4) was an average project with average players, even though everything about it was extraordinary. I see how my actions could be perceived as disrespectful to your status as a world-class artist, supporter of the arts, and human rights defender. Your image and identity are precious, so I should have known better than to take at face value an early conversational nod on your part to make and market this movie as I saw fit. Promoting your involvement in the film while failing to fully include you in our Kickstarter preparations was careless. You demonstrated foresight and fortitude by stopping the fundraising campaign before it may have potentially wreaked damage to your public image, and for that I am humbled. Thank you for taking time, earlier this month when I visited, to speak with me about it and for all your previous encouragement with the film. Ai Weiwei, it has been an honor to work beside you and Du Ke Feng \u2013 I can imagine no greater artistic and cinematic Dream Team. My intent was to honor you, not exploit you. Despite missteps in fundraising strategy, I hope you might renew your faith in this project, but more than that, I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me and to consider me your friend. I continue to admire you tremendously, as a person, as a creator, and as a crusader of art and justice. \u8c22\u8c22\u60a8\n\nTO EVERYONE ELSE: Your encouragement has meant the world to me. Thank you. \n\nWhen I finally started talking about THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4), after waiting until we nearly finished the art-house sci-fi short we'd been making in China, it was because I wondered how we might complete it with the same quality we brought to our initial shoot, done under unusual, perhaps extraordinary, circumstances \u2013 for which I already drained my savings and borrowed from close friends. \"If you can launch a Kickstarter campaign within ten days,\" a stranger overhearing my story at a party said to me, \"I'll pitch in your first $5000 because this sounds like a movie worth making.\"\n\nTwo thousand supporters signed up for the adventure. What started as a dare, fast-tracked to one of the most successful short film campaigns in Kickstarter history \u2013 we might almost break even, and we could at last share our project with the world.\n\nFrom inception, our plan was to release THE SAND STORM online, for free. Crowdfunding made that a real possibility. The majority of backers pledged $11 to watch THE SAND STORM one day in advance plus see their names in the credits, the digital equivalent of lining up for a blockbuster and getting a hug for it. The Guardian wrote: \"far from a Hollywood blockbuster, it is a short film funded by Kickstarter, so it's all very artistically pure.\" The highest compliment. \n\nThe flood of interest in a project we'd kept hidden for so long felt invigorating at first, but then, five days before our scheduled end, the historic campaign went on ice. Why? I alienated the friend and collaborator who inspired it all, and who, up until that point, had been hugely encouraging. Until this happened \u2013 FAST CO. EXIST (April 30).\n\nExcept when we meet in person, Ai Weiwei's studio mediates our correspondence, and I hastily sent advance-links via my usual, casual contacts, rather than his standard channels for such matters, without follow-up on my part, interpreting silence as approval. From our opposite sides of the Great Firewall, things that sometimes seem straightforward can be fraught. Creative endeavors with artistic titans should not be treated lightly. An easily avoidable mistake on my part led to an unpleasant surprise on his: discovering our fundraiser secondhand, through the invasiveness of Google alerts and press inquiries which eclipsed any fun we shared on set. Having waited for a finished film, he instead got chaos coupled with inaccuracies (the distinction of his acting debut belongs not here but to 1993's CCTV series \"A Beijinger in New York\"). How do you say \"I'm sorry\" to the Never Sorry Guy?\n\nThe day after the campaign-freeze, I hopped on a plane to China for a week, we met three times, and he requested I tone down emphasis on him for fundraising purposes.\n\nTo clarify \u2013 he is still in the film, same as ever. Our edit is \"locked\" but because there's more work to do, our release date is in limbo. We've given you our word we will finish THE SAND STORM. And we will. Soon. Movies are meant to be seen.\n\nWhen our campaign went viral to a degree I had only dreamed of for the finished film, I expected the discourse to naturally move away from the topic of celebrity on its own \u2026 but that is not how public conversation works. Nobody needs be singled out as an isolated star: the characters of THE WOMAN, THE MAN, THE LOVER, THE WATER SMUGGLER are equally deserving of recognition, as are each and every member of our expertly talented crew. Now, as we re-launch for five days, let me overtly hijack your focus to a topic far more meaningful, namely, the rise of super-cities and their potential for the decay of health and safety.\n\nThis movie isn't about making a movie star out of an artist \u2014 it\u2019s about making a movie star out of an idea.\n\nSci-fi, as a genre, allows us to speculate about possible future choices, but when the present moves faster than fiction, action is also needed. We shot this short drama with its backdrop of water rationing while on-set pollution levels skyrocketed above international standards for measurement and safety (on a scale of 1-500, smoggy days in Los Angeles registering 60-90, Beijing indexes hit a record 800). The script called for our day players to wear air filter masks to look \"dystopian,\" but the crew wore them as well; we had to. When we edit, I can hear myself coughing on the sound track. This problem is not only endemic to China but in super-cities rising all over the world.\n\nWe hope THE SAND STORM will encourage new conversations about environmental degradation, and how we can create a better future \u2026 but, mostly, entertain.\n\nUntil then, welcome to the *final* final five days of fundraising, another part of our journey \u2013 part of what you get as a supporter of THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4).\n\nJason\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "SAND STORM Northern California Screening at The Mendocino Film Festival - This Weekend!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "ANATOMY OF A SHOT (Opening Titles): Creating the Sand Storm Cityscape", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "AFTER THE SAND STORM \u2013 #1", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 63, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wishnow/a-secret-sci-fi-film-shot-in-china-starring-ai-wei", "project_name": "a secret sci-fi film shot in china \u2022 THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4)"}}, {"backer": "Brent Morris", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\u201cHerwig struck gold\u201d - itsnicethat.com\nPhotographer Christopher Herwig has covered more than 30,000 km by car, bike, bus and taxi in 13 countries discovering and documenting these unexpected treasures of modern art. From the shores of the Black Sea to the endless Kazakh steppe, the bus stops show the range of public art from the Soviet era and give a rare glimpse into the creative minds of the time. Herwig\u2019s series attracted considerable media interest around the world, and now with the 12 year project complete, the full collection will be presented in Soviet Bus Stops as a deluxe, limited edition, hard cover photo book. The book represents the most comprehensive and diverse collection of Soviet bus stop design ever assembled.\nTHE BUS STOPS\n\u201cdelicate balance between modern art and clinical insanity\u201d - bearsandvodka.com\n\u201cfascinating\u201d - Huffington Post \nArmenia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan\nPerhaps it\u2019s no coincidence that the word for bus (A\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0431\u0443\u0441) shares the symbol for anarchy; in many regions of the former Soviet Union the local bus shelter was built seemingly without design restrictions, or even budget limit. These projects became a precious opportunity for local artists and architects to express themselves. Instead of one standardized design we find 1000\u2019s of unique and sometimes whimsical creations. They represent a mix of styles, shapes and sizes, from swirling tile mosaic pieces, to elegant geometric forms, to miniature temples of symbolist expression.\nTHE BOOK \u2013 hardcover, landscape A4 \u2013 128 pages\n\u201cA book of Soviet bus stops?

Pre-order your copy of this limited edition book now and make this project a reality.\nTHE JOURNEY AND THE OBSESSION\nBy chance I discovered a phenomenon that set in motion a photographic journey that would span 12 years and 13 countries. Hunting for the most amazing road side bus shelters in the former Soviet Union would become my muse and my reason to travel.\nDuring a cycling trip from London to St. Petersburg in the autumn of 2002 I set myself a photographic challenge to take one good photo every hour. It was on this trip that I first paid attention to the bus stops. The long hours in the saddle and slowly changing landscape along country roads in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Russia provided the setting for my discovery and the birth of my obsession. Here the designs mainly played with purely graphic shapes, each different stretch of road revealing a new set of creations to break up an otherwise bleak landscape.\nBetween 2003 and 2006 I lived in Kazakhstan, and I explored the five \u2018Stan\u2019 countries and former Soviet states of Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Along these silk routes I found more fascinating bus stops, often appearing in the middle of the desert, steppe or countryside, with no other sign of human settlement in sight. It was as if the earth was its pedestal and nothing else on the endless horizon could compete with the bold statement it was making.\nKyrgyzstan, Armenia, Abkhazia\nMy obsession grew and saw me hit the road further to visit five more former soviet countries: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and the breakaway region of Abkhazia, and later to revisit the Baltics, travelling thousands more kilometres by bus, rental car and taxi with the specific task of hunting down the very best bus stops. I was possessed. On a mission. Nothing was going to deter me from my hunt. I searched travellers\u2019 blogs for clues, interrogated bus and taxi drivers and even scanned over the roads on Google Earth to plan what I believed would be most effective routes. I was not disappointed as each new discovery pushed to outshine the previous.\nSeveral of these countries have little freedom of press and expression. Tourists are rare. Visas for photographers were hard to come by. I often had to instead go into the countries on tourist visas. Despite my efforts not to arouse suspicion I was, on several occasions, accused of being a spy and only narrowly avoided getting caught up in something rather awkward. With reluctance this added to the adventure and made each new discovery even more precious. In Abkhazia my driver accused me of being a Georgian agent and photographing sensitive material. He demanded a bribe, otherwise, it would be \u201cstraight to the militizia and a firing squad\u201d. Needless to say, he was not convinced by my story that \u201cI have only come to your country to see your pretty bus stops\u201d. I was happy to escape from the journey with relatively little drama, and even happier to have captured some of the most beautifully insane bus stops I had ever encountered, safe on a memory card tucked into my underpants.\nThis photo series is likely the largest collection of Soviet Bus Stops ever assembled. A tenuous claim to fame, I admit, and a strange obsession to have. But still, it\u2019s one that I am proud of and I hope it will help to preserve this unique and historical art form.\nSigned Archival Prints", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest challenge of finding the bus stops and taking the photos is done.

We know the rest of the Internet beckons, so my producing partner, Ella Sitkin, and I appreciate that you stopped by for a few minutes.\nWe hope you watched our pitch video above. Here are a few more details about CENTS that we just couldn't cram into it that we think you might like to know.\nThe screenplay for CENTS was an Academy Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting semifinalist in 2012 - one of 129 semifinalists out of 7,197 entries (top 1.8% of all entries, woo-hoo!). CENTS was also invited to the second round of the Sundance Institute Screenwriting Lab selection process.\nI'm the first contributor to this film.\nMaking feature films costs money. A lot of money. So, once I decided I wanted to make CENTS as my first feature film, I put $30,000 of my own money into an account for the production of CENTS. But to make the film at the production level that the script requires, we need to raise more money.\nMaking films is such a collaborative process, which is one of the main reasons I'm so drawn to the format. I love working with a crew of creative people, all moving forward to tell a great story as a film. I also love sharing my filmmaking experiences with friends, family and new people I meet everyday. Kickstarter is a great way to bring all of those people together to help get a project like CENTS off the ground.\nThe Teaser\nWe haven't made CENTS yet, but we realize that audiences need a glimpse into our vision for the final film. So, we shot a teaser earlier this year to give audiences a sense of the mood and style of the final film with just a hint of the story. You probably noticed a few of the clips in our Kickstarter video above. You can check out the teaser in its original form below:\nGirls, Math and \"Drama\"\nCENTS will be a unique feature film for several reasons:\nThe film focuses almost exclusively on girls and their relationships with each other.\nThe film's plot revolves around math, and our young female protagonist Sammy is off the charts with her math skills as a 12-year-old.\nThe film addresses relational aggression or bullying (i.e. \"drama\") among girls without making it a black-and-white issue - each girl plays multiple roles, shifting from victim to bully to bystander, much like the real world. All of these girls make mistakes, so the real question is, will they learn from their mistakes?\nHow Kickstarter Funds Will Help Make CENTS\nAfter paying the fees to Kickstarter and Amazon Payments and covering the costs of rewards, the funds raised on Kickstarter will pay for crew wages, food and equipment rentals on the production of CENTS.\nIn addition to Kickstarter funds and my own $30,000, we have applied for a grant from the Tribeca Film Institute Sloan Filmmaker Fund. We were a strong contender for the grant last year and were encouraged to reapply after making progress. We are also actively meeting with other potential financing sources to complete our financing.\nA successful Kickstarter campaign will help us get additional financing.\nOrganizations that offer grants like Tribeca Film Institute are looking for concrete evidence of our progress toward producing CENTS. Your contribution to our Kickstarter campaign not only helps us make CENTS, it will also help us get the additional financing from other resources that we need. So you are doubly awesome for contributing to CENTS!\nPlease Spread the Word!\nWe certainly hope you'll join us and contribute to our Kickstarter campaign to help us make CENTS. We also hope you will invite one friend personally by email every day of our campaign and ask them to join you in supporting CENTS on Kickstarter. Then, ask that friend to invite one friend personally by email every day to join our campaign.\nEvery contribution counts. Even $1 will help us make CENTS.\n***\nSpecial thanks to the CNM Film Technician Training Program for its help with the Kickstarter video shoot.\nMusic by Ben Beiny\nCENTS Teaser cast & crew credits\nKickstarter widget animation (including After Effects files and how-to video) by Joke & Biagio [via No Film School]", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause our cast is primarily 12-year-old girls and the film takes place in a school setting, we have to shoot in the summer.

This means Kickstarter rewards fulfillment will also be delayed.\n\nWe've already put a lot of planning into the production of CENTS, but unforeseen problems always arise during film productions.

Veterans are coming back home with horrifying and devastating issues, and many feel that they can't find the help they need. This trend breaks our hearts, so we are making a documentary to get to the bottom of the problems, and help the people who are trying to fix things get the exposure they deserve. As longtime filmmakers, we have recently opened a Production Company named ABQ Mastermind Productions and we are trying to gain exposure through projects that will attract a following and make a difference in the world that we are all apart of creating. As a Veteran myself, I feel Veterans will relate with the interviewees whom we have spoken with, and America will be drawn to the stories and passion that our Veterans embody. We should all strive to live with the same dedication that our Veterans do on our behalf each and every day.

Travel will be a huge part of our project, and we all know how difficult that can be. Two of our Producers have been film industry Travel Coordinators before, so we are confident that we can adapt. Finding the Veterans and businesses to showcase is always challenging, but our positive mindsets and reputations have continued to be the difference as things keeps working out fortunately. We have made some amazing contacts already on this project and our network and possibilities continue to evolve and progress. So far, we have had the privilege of interviewing 4 amazing Veterans that have been going through the process of reintegrating into this fast paced private sector of a world. We have also been able to have an inside look at two Companies - Working Wardrobe and VetNet which have made organizations around and to include Veterans in a manner which includes dignity and respect for the Veteran with multiple needs. Our goal is to find a few more Companies that are giving above and beyond for our Veterans, in addition to a few more Veterans we can get connected with the Companies.

Lurking underground for years, they risk throwing open fresh wounds in communities which are just beginning to heal.\nAfghanistan, a country with a long history of war, is dotted with these subterranean dangers. According to one report, about 1 million Afghans live within 500 meters of areas expected to contain landmines. Recently, a group of 10 girls lost their lives when they encountered a hidden mine on a routine outing to gather wood. On average, landmines claim about 42 lives every month.\nThis \u201cMine Kafon\u201d is a spherical mobile made out of biodegradable plastic and bamboo. It\u2019s light enough that the wind would--in theory--push it around naturally. But it is also heavy enough to set off landmines as it rolls over them.\n\u201cWith each detonation the Mine Kafon loses just one or two legs so it could potentially destroy three or four landmines in one journey\nThe Mine Kafon, at this prototype stage, has been exhibited at the London Design Museum, Milan Design Week, Helsinki Museum, Dutch Design Week, Lodz Design Festival and acquired by MOMA in New York.\nAlthough it's been a great experience to have the Mine Kafon exhibited, we really designed it with the hope of deploying it in an actual minefield.\nWe now need your support to take it to the next level:\nHow much will it cost?:\nWe are asking for \u00a3100,000.00\nThis will cover costs related to engineering, fabrication, transport and the creation of a short documentary.\nCOST BREAKDOWN\nEngineering\u2013 \u00a324,500\nThis includes brainstorming sessions with an engineering company, engineering of the pressure points, the core with a GPS, the software (gps and website) and bamboo connection points. \nMolds \u2013 \u00a332,500\nMaking the molds ready for production \nFabrication\u2013 \u00a38,500\nPayment of team to build, fabricate and crash test the new design in the workshop.\nProduction of Rewards - \u00a316,500\nPayment and manufacturing of the rewards \nFilm Production- \u00a3 18,000\nCrew travel and transport of the Mine Kafon\u2019s to the minefield, documentary film licenses and other film production costs.\nRewards:\nPledge \u00a35 or more for a formal thank you credit on the film.\nThe documentary will be produced and directed by award winning, short film maker Callum Cooper. The documentary about the prototype is currently a finalist in the Sundance Focus Forward competition, so if you like that film, expect to see a longer, more involved movie.\nPledge \u00a37 and we will send you 3 very special Mine Kafon postcards.\nplus the thankyou credit on the film\nThese aren't just your typical postcard, they are way better, because they are augmented reality!\nSo when you point your smart phone or tablet at these seemingly normal postcard you will see things happen.\nThe first card is a video card, you see the kafon explode in super slow-motion. The footage is from the military tests we did last year that Callum documented and used in the short film.\nThe second card is a 3d model card, you see a 3-dimensional Mine Kafon move around ontop of the card.\nThe third card, we think is the coolest, it is the portal card.

We need to install the Mine Kafon with a specific GPS that has a higher than normal level of accuracy. We hope to develop this aspect with the engineering company that will partner the project. We will then need to develop the software which will allow this information to be mapped.\n\n2. We will need to engineer more advanced pressure points to detonate the mines more precisely.\n\n3. We will need to work with the engineers to improve the construction so it has higher durability. \n\n4. We will need to work with engineers to plan for mass production.\n\n5. We want to design a retrieval system for the Mine Kafon, which will possibly be a motorised system within the core. This will allow it to move out of, or away from undesired positions. We still want to fabricate it as cheaply as possible.\n\nSpecific Location of Mine Field for the field test and filming:\n\nSome of my family are still in Afghanistan so we have a fairly clear understanding of the stability of the region. If however, by next year it is too unstable to travel there, we will release the Mine Kafon in a a similar but less dangerous location, such as Western Sahara or Southern Lebanon.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Special reward tier made for you", "update_content": "Hey guys,\nAs you know our new Mine Kafon Drone campaign is coming to an end in less than 55 hours.

One day, however, the gods allowed all the birds to gather their own colors. Blue Bird flew in the sky and absorbed the sky for its color. Yellow Bird flew into a corn field and absorbed the color of the corn pollen. One bird went on a quest to gather all the colors of the rainbow. What ever became of that bird?\nI grew up listening to this story and many others during my youth on the Navajo reservation. While listening to these stories, I often imagined a vibrant colorful world where animals had human qualities and could speak with humans. \nTo capture that essence, I will use costumed dancers to play the animals in Rainbow Bird. To bring this world to vivid life, I am going to animate each and every single frame. \nI can't wait until you see the finished productions of both The Lady and the Eagle (the film that I have been animating in preparation) and Rainbow Bird. This will truly be a new step forward for interpolate rotoscope and native story telling.\nT'aashoodii shik'aa'iinleed nibeeso lah shaani'aah!

One of which that I am excited for, if you donate $25 I will animate a picture of you that you will email to me.

The cost to homeowners would have been $10 a month for 5 years and it would have generated 7 million a year for the local public schools. The loss was heartbreaking to hundreds of people who had worked tirelessly on behalf of the 19,000 public school students in the PUSD district.\nA group of active parents discussed why the measure had failed to pass and each shared how people they had spoken to while phone banking repeatedly shared misimpressions of our public schools. It was discovered that most people voting against the measure had not set foot on a campus in years or ever for that matter. We grappled with how to bring our community in to the world of our public schools so they could see for themselves the myriad of opportunities that were available as well as the needs.\nMy husband and I decided to use our professional skills to introduce our community to our public schools. We grappled with what might be the best way to do this, and we hatched the idea of 50 crews on all 28 campuses in one day to capture on film an authentic \u201cday in the life of PUSD\u201d. That initial idea began a two-year journey that included the unprecedented cooperation of the PUSD district to allow 50 crews on all their campuses in one day.\n40 of the crews we assemblied were professional documentary crews and 10 of the crews were student crews made up of middle and high school students. These students were either taking a video class or had a keen interest in filmmaking. We spent many days training the student crews and brought in mentors for the day of the shoot to assist and support them. This has been a rewarding aspect of this project and all 10 students crews have produced a short film which is posted on the GO PUBLIC website alongside the 40 professionally produced films.\nAn interesting aspect of this project is that it started with a local focus but has generated interest on a national level because Pasadena\u2019s public schools are very ethnically and socio-economically diverse and typical of many urban districts throughout our country. The theme, to celebrate our public schools and educate people about the need for broader support, has resonated with people from all over the country.\nWe think the short films and the long form documentary will have a significant impact on communities everywhere\u2026if we can raise the funds to finish post production and do the outreach to make sure it is available. Nothing is more important than educating ALL the children of our nation.\nHow Your Money Will Help:\nYour support will help us finish the film and allow us to spread the story of GO PUBLIC to audiences everywhere.\nIf you are able to contribute financially we have a wonderfully fresh approach to the Kickstarter incentives.  An angel donor has agreed that every time someone donates to the GO PUBLIC Project, they will contribute an item to a local PUSD school.  Please spread the word about our Kickstarter campaign to your friends and family and anyone who might have an interest and a passion for this subject matter.  Help us reach people all across this country via Facebook and Twitter and other social media platforms.  Help GO PUBLIC...go public!!!   \nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how we plan to use the funds: \n\u2022 Pay for the Editor for three more months. \n\u2022 Pay for the Composer.\n\u2022 Pay for sound design and mix.\n\u2022 Pay for finishing graphics.\n\u2022 Pay to update the website and keep it current.\n\u2022 Pay for initial marketing and distribution costs.\nWhy Donate?\nWe feel it is time to give voice to those living the public school experience. GO PUBLIC does that.  We feel it is time for people to become informed advocates for their local public schools. With your participation we can complete this film and use it to inspire advocacy across our nation.\nCan we exceed our goal?\nYes, and we need to. We are starting with $25,000 on Kickstarter because we think with the all-or-nothing approach we can raise that amount. But, frankly, we will still face additional costs once we begin to market and distribute the film and all money raised will help us toward that end. \nWhat if we don\u2019t reach our goal?\nIf funding fails, all pledges are canceled and that\u2019s that. Your card is not charged, it\u2019s like nothing ever happened. We hope that doesn\u2019t happen! Those 30 days will fly by, please contribute today! \nCan you donate from outside of the United States?\nYes! Just click on the Amazon Payment Button and you will see that you can pay with a credit card from any country. But you must finish the Amazon checkout process for your pledge to be recorded. If you have any problems please contact us. \nCan I increase my pledge once it\u2019s been made?\nYES! Once you donate to our campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount. To do so, go to Kickstarter and sign in. If you go to our campaign page, the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button has been replaced with a blue \u201cManage Your Donation\u201d button. Click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive.\nCan I use Paypal and will my donation be tax deductible?\nKickstarter allows donations to be tax deductible if you are classified as a non-profit. We are. All money raised goes through the Pasadena Education Network, a 501C-3 non-profit whose mission is to promote family engagement in public education.  \nWant to help but can\u2019t donate?\nBecome an Outreach Partner.

It examines the current role Internet search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, have played in the news content game and the dangers involved with the online homogenization of news.\nReporters working for or recently laid-off from major metropolitan newspapers are interviewed, providing insight into how investigative reporting has fallen by the wayside. We interview many industry professionals including journalism school professors, such as Geneva Overholser, the director of the Annenberg School of Journalism. Notable media theorists have been interviewed, including Noam Chomsky and in-the-field newspaper staff, such as David Barstow and Robert Kaiser.\nThe filmmakers have so far recorded interviews with reporters currently or once associated with The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, The Los Angeles Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Wall Street Journal, Newsday, The Rocky Mountain News, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and The San Diego Union-Tribune. In addition, we have conducted interviews with founders of news websites such as Voice of San Diego, MinnPost, and ProPublica.\n\"Fit to Print\" also showcases meaningful case stories that shed light onto investigative stories that have fallen by the wayside, including depleted coverage on stories Laura Frank (The Rocky Mountain News) and Andrew Schneider (The Seattle P.I.) began on public health disasters.\nTaking its cue from Michael Moore\u2019s \u201cSicko\u201d and Robert Kenner's \u201cFood Inc.,\u201d \u201cFit to Print\u201d is poised to dissect an industry in peril; at the same time, it highlights the positive aspects of launching journalism into a digital world.\nShot in Digital HD, we employ a creative structure and that includes an animation segment, video and audio interviews, stock footage and mixed print and online media.\nWe are seeking funding to complete the film. In order to edit our film into a 90-minute documentary, we will be using a tape deck to view and edit the footage, money to finance our final interviews with the Denver Post and Seattle Post Intelligencer. This money will also contribute to the many artists involved in the production, including our composer and animator.\nFeel free to contact one of the producers at adamgchadwick@gmail.com and nancy.wolfe@gmail.com\nAdditional information can be found on our website - http://fittoprintfilm.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "19 backers pledged $5,005"}, {"Project launches": "OCTOBER 2, 2010"}]}], "comment_no": 1, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/596560894/fit-to-print-a-documentary-about-the-us-newspaper", "project_name": "\"Fit to Print\" - a documentary about the US Newspaper Industry"}}, {"backer": "Brent Morris", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN:\nWhile filmmakers have never been properly compensated for allowing festivals to exhibit their films, things have only gotten worse. Since the beginning of The Great Recession festivals across the country have exploited the economic crisis as a reason to end filmmaker compensation. Now, it is assumed filmmakers will slave away on a film for years, submit it to festivals at 65 bucks a pop and then politely watch as the festival takes 100% of the box office while giving the filmmaker absolutely nothing.\nAudiences are treated no better. Festivals rent second-rate projectors. They exhibit in expensive, antiquated formats (BetacamSP anyone?) and treat audio as an afterthought. Forget 5.1 surround sound\u2026forget stereo. Most festival screenings are in mono. Francis Ford Coppola may have said that \u201cHalf of what you see is what you hear\u201d but that hasn\u2019t stopped the majority of festivals from living like it\u2019s 1973.\nWhen a local multiplex with minimum wage high school students can do a better job projecting movies than the festival circuit it should be no surprise that audiences and filmmakers alike do not trust festivals to deliver a superior cinema experience.\nWE LOVE CINEMA:\nWe love crisp, bright projection. We love awesome 5.1 sound. We love the sensation of one hundred people laughing together in the dark. We love smart filmmakers and we love savvy audiences. We are filmmakers who believe that change begins with us\u2026and so, rather than quietly complain about the state of independent film and the festival circuit we are going to make a change.\nFILMMAKER COMPENSATION:\nFirst and foremost, we want to revolutionize how a festival compensates officially selected filmmakers. They will receive 50% of our box office gross. Not net, gross. Filmmakers will be given space at both the ticket booth and at each screening to sell merchandise...and they will keep 100%. Filmmakers will be reimbursed for travel (up to $200.00 for short filmmakers & $300.00 for feature filmmakers). They will receive a paid hotel room. They will receive pre-paid meals at participating restaurants. And, we will return their submission fee .\nAUDIENCE EXPERIENCE:\nEvery screening will be exhibited with our own 1080p, 5.1 surround sound system. We always take the time to properly calibrate our gear. We will conduct customer service training with every ticket agent. We will run a shorter festival (4 days instead of the standard 7-10) to ensure every movie is worth seeing. No filler. No junk. If the film is in our festival then it is worth the audiences time and money to see it.\nRETHINK EVERYTHING:\nWe are eliminating all paper from the festival process. No brochures, no paper posters, no junk waiting for a landfill. 42\" 1080p kiosks will be set up throughout the festival area that show trailers, promotional stills, posters, sneak peaks, behind-the-scenes featurettes, film information and daily schedules simultaneously (and can be reused for years to come). This will eliminate the need for expensive paper schedules that are only days away from the local dump...year after year.\nOur website will have digital schedules available for iDevices. These will also be available on preloaded iPads located at every venue throughout the festival.\nAfter Parties will be radically different as well. How does a filmmaker talk to fans, fellow artists and potential investors with blaring techno turned up to eleven? Our after parties are going to be more Rat Pack than Brat Pack. Quality musicians who understand how to play a stripped down, acoustic set will host each night's party.\nWe are eliminating awards. Filmmaking is not an olympic sport. Becoming an official selection is the prize...particularly when the filmmaker is sharing in the financial benefits of exhibition! We believe filmmakers would rather earn $500.00 in ticket sales than receive a $20.00 lucite trophy.\nLastly, we are a touring film festival. Each year we will be in a different New Mexican town or village. We want to promote the stunning beauty of our state. New Mexico is the third largest state in America...we cannot properly promote the land of enchantment if we are always in the same town!\nHOW YOUR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION WILL HELP:\nYour financial contribution will be used for:\n1.) Buy cutting edge exhibition equipment, including projectors, speakers, carts & TV's.\n2.) Purchase sound-treating material. Since we will be exhibiting in small towns high in the mountains there won't be any local movie theaters. We need to transform local spaces into acoustically amazing spaces.\n3.) Media exposure. Our primary goal is to be the example of what every festival should be. We need other film festivals to know what we have done, to see how we have turned their stodgy business model on its ear and to feel pressure from filmmakers who hopefully will ask the question \"If the NMIFF can do this, why can't everyone?\"\n4.) Plane tickets, hotel rooms & food for our annual artists.\n5.) General festival operational expenses. From cell phone bills to graphic artists, from vinyl banners to caterers, festivals are expensive. We have eliminated every unnecessary expense we can. However, there will always be overhead in running such a complicated event.\nOUR QUALIFICATIONS:\nOur festival director is also a filmmaker. He's spent three years working on the award-winning spy thriller, A Lonely Place For Dying. Our associate director is a visual effects artist with a minor in business. Together, their network of friends and family have done projects far more complicated than a four day film festival.\n\"While I was in college I worked as a theater assistant manager and projectionist. Then, I became a filmmaker. I never thought my first job in this business would be so important, but it prepared me for understanding exhibition and promotion.\" said festival director Justin Eugene Evans.\n\"Everyone told us this would be incredibly difficult. And, then we held two screenings of our own movie; one in Albuquerque and one in Los Angeles. And, we realized...this is easy. If you have a work ethic and care about people then this is incredibly easy.\" said associate director Marc Leonard.\n501(C)3 MEANS YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS TAX DEDUCTABLE:\nThe New Mexico International Film Festival is a 501(C)3. That means your contribution will be tax deductable.\nCHANGE THE WORLD:\nCulture is a critical component of any society. And, cinema is a critical part of American culture. Cinema culture is under attack from corporate consolidation. The sleepy, ad hoc collection of privately run festivals in our nation do not understand their own importance. They do not realize they have the power to be an alternate distribution system.\nYour contribution will help us change the fundamentals of film festivals in America. Help us grow so that we can show the entire industry what a festival can and should be.\nWE DO NOT STRIVE TO BE BIG:\nBut, we do strive to be the best. And, we have checks-and-balances, post-mortems, high quality equipment and that intangible burning in our stomach that demands we do this right. Ghandi once said \u201cBe the change you wish to see in the world.\u201d We accept that challenge.

We love watching them, we love making them, and most of all, we love making them fast. Our first experiment in speed filmmaking, \u201cThe Queen Bee of Mushroomtown,\u201d won eight prizes at the 2009 New York Film Race (including Best Film and the Audience Award); we followed that up with 12 Films 12 Weeks, a grand experiment whose results you can see at www.12films12weeks.com. Now we're ready to move our race-against-time approach into the realm of feature films. And we're going to need your help.\n\nTHE PITCH\n\nOn July 30th, 2010, ten young filmmakers will gather together in a condo in Park City, Utah. Each team member will bring along a photograph of his or her choosing, carefully concealed from the other members of the group. At midnight on August 1st, the ten photographs will be unveiled for the first time, and the resulting collage of images will serve as the jumping-off place for a freewheeling session of brainstorming. That brainstorming will lead to characters, scenes, dialogue, and eventually a script for a full-length movie, which will then be shot, edited, and scored \u2013 all in just four weeks.\n\nIS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?\n\nWe think so.\n\nTHE TEAM\n\nTeam Four-Week Feature is (in alphabetical order): Keith Boynton, Writer/Director/Producer; Clint Byrne, Key Grip/2nd Unit DP; Brigitte Choura, Actor; James Fauvell, Actor; Mike Lavoie, Writer/Actor/Producer; Sumi Lee, Production Manager; Michael Redfield, Actor/Composer; Chad Sonenberg, Sound; Derek Van Gorder, Cinematographer; and a mystery 10th person to be announced! Bios of all the team members can be found at www.FourWeekFeature.com.\n\nWHAT THE MONEY WILL GO TO\n\nOur biggest expense will be salaries for the wonderful team of actors and crew we've assembled. No one is going to get rich by working on this movie; we're just offering people enough to lure them away from their jobs for a month. The average salary for one team member is $500 per week; other expenses will include travel to Park City, gas, food, and surely a prop or two. Between the ten of us, we already own most of the relevant camera and sound equipment, and our housing is being generously donated by Keith's mom.

And just think \u2013 if each of the 103 of you can get just new person to pledge money, and each of those new backers pledges an average of $40, we'll sail past $10,000 with a few dollars to spare!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Amazing news! We have MATCHING FUNDS!", "update_content": "My dear wonderful backers,\nWith 18 days to go, we are currently hovering around 1/3 of our $10,000 goal. This is very solid progress \u2013 especially given that Mike and I were more or less \"off the grid\" for a week \u2013 and we have all of you to thank! Your efforts to spread the word through e-mail, Facebook, and Twitter (along with your pledges, of course!) have made our funding goal seem well within reach. And we're more eager than ever to reach that goal, because of exciting news which I will now reveal."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Video!", "update_content": "Dear friends and supporters,\nOne of our major goals with this project is to document it as exhaustively as we can. Back in May, when we were shooting our promo video for Kickstarter, we also took some time to gather a little documentary footage of various team members talking about their roles in the project and how they got involved. I've cut that footage together into a five-minute video \u2013 the first, but far from the last, peek behind the scenes of the Four-Week Feature. I hope you enjoy it!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Get your first look at our official 4WF t-shirts!", "update_content": "First of all, we'd like to thank all our early backers for their generous pledges. Thanks to you, we've crossed the all-important $1,000 threshold, which puts us 10% of the way towards our goal!\nSecondly, since nine people have already signed up to receive an official Four-Week Feature t-shirt, we thought we should offer everyone a peek at what the shirts will look like. Not bad, eh?
