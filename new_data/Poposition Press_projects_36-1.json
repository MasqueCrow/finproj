Having myself experienced what can happen when a screenplay becomes a graphic novel, to say I'm excited by this Kickstarter is very much an understatement!\u201d \u2014 William Gibson\nMADI is a 260-page road trip graphic novel set in the near future, by film director Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and writer Alex de Campi (BAD KARMA, BLADE RUNNER), and drawn by some of comics\u2019 most exciting artists including Glenn Fabry, Simon Bisley, Duncan Fegredo and Pia Guerra. Each artist tackles a 8-30 page section of the story, bringing to life one location.\nSee for yourself: Download the first 19 pages of MADI here! Includes both the Fegredo/Phillips and Shimizu covers.\n This project is EU/UK shipping friendly! We are drop-shipping to a UK distributor so shipping is affordable to our huge and beloved European fanbase. Estimated maximum shipping costs for a single book are: US: $10 / Canada & Mexico: $15 / UK: $20 / Mainland Europe: $25 / Rest of World: $55. Shipping costs will be collected at checkout (after the campaign ends) via Backerkit, where you\u2019ll also have the chance to add on additional books or upgrade to a higher-tier book. \nMadi Preston, a veteran of Britain\u2019s elite special operations J-Squad unit, is burnt out and up to her eyeballs in debt. She and the rest of her team have retired from the military but are now trapped having to pay to service and maintain the technology put into them during their years of service.   They're working for British conglomerate Liberty Inc as  mercenaries, selling their unique ability to be remote controlled by specialists while in the field, and the debts are only growing as they get injured completing missions. We meet Madi as she decides she\u2019s had enough.  She will take an off-the-books job that should earn her enough to pay out her and her sister, but when the piece of tech she\u2019s supposed to steal turns out to be a kid, and she suddenly blacks out... she finds herself on the run from everyone she\u2019s ever known. \nIn a globe-spanning adventure from Shanghai to Soho, Madi has to stay one step ahead of the giant corporations closing in on her from all sides. \nMADI is the third and final story in the \u201cMooniverse,\u201d an anthology of independent stories that take place in a shared future. You don\u2019t need to have seen MOON or MUTE to fully enjoy this standalone book.\nThe full roster of line artists are: Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Oca\u00f1a, Andr\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O\u2019Connell, Tonci Zonjic, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Gu\u00e9ra, Chris Weston,  Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David Lopez and Christian Ward. Our amazing colour team includes: Matt Wilson, Nayoung Kim, Chris O\u2019Halloran, Adam Brown, Jacob Phillips, Ra\u00fal Arnaiz, Giulia Brusco, Sergey Nazarov and Kelly Fitzpatrick. Lettering is by Alex. \nEvery artist has been paid their full asking rate and is also getting royalties on the project. As freelancers ourselves, we believe in being the change we want to see in the industry.  \nThe book is almost finished being drawn and is currently being lettered. It will be sent to backers in early November, and comes in your choice of a luxe 7\u00bc X 10 \u00bd\u201d paperback, a 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d hardback (the original art size), or an oversize 10 x 14\u00bd\u201d cased hardback with over 40 pages of back matter. The paperback cover is by Duncan Fegredo & Jacob Phillips, and the hardback cover is by Yuko Shimizu. \nDuncan Fegredo and Jacob Phillips' beautiful wrap cover for the paperback edition\nBecause both Duncan and Alex have big fanbases in Europe we are doing our damnedest to make sure shipping is as inexpensive as possible while maintaining safe and careful mailing of these extremely nice, high quality editions. We're working with drop-shipping to UK distributors so European buyers won't have to pay airmail from the US.  Backerkit is handling all our pledge management and will be charging shipping at the end, once the campaign is over (you'll also be able to add on books or upgrade your pledge at that time, if you want). Z2 has its own warehouse, so US fulfillment can be handled easily and professionally in-house. \nNo digital version of MADI will be made available at this time, or indeed maybe ever.\nStores, you will be able to order MADI for retail sale at your fine shops a few weeks after Kickstarter fulfillment.  \nYuko Shimizu's luscious cover for the hardback edition\nA model of Yuko's cover on the hardback, without logos (why interrupt the pretty until you have to)\nThe deluxe slipcase edition is truly a magnificent book, with the art reproduced at luscious 10\u201d x 14.5\u201d size (a 20% blowup on the book\u2019s original art size of 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d) and with over 60 pages of extras, process, and essays from Duncan and Alex, along with surprise bonus art from friends like Colleen Doran and Jeffrey Veregge! See a scene go from original screenplay through Alex\u2019s handwritten breakdowns to comic script, pencils, inks, then colours! Pore over the thumbnails and rough layouts of masters like Duncan Fegredo and RM Gu\u00e9ra! Enjoy all the character sketches and development work that went on behind the scenes (there was a lot, this project was super complex to produce) such as Annie Wu\u2019s amazing Kitty Cop concept art, below! (The whole Kitty Cop origin story is pretty great, too, it basically involves Alex + too much sugar.) \nThe Madi deluxe edition with diecut slipcase\nThe slipcase edition features Yuko\u2019s gorgeous wrap cover without logos, inside a diecut slipcase that allows Yuko\u2019s illustration of Madi to show through. This slipcase edition will not be available for retail sale; if you miss it here, maybe we might have a few at the Z2 Comics table at a convention, but maybe not. \nAnnie Wu\u2019s concept art for our Kitty Cops, or: \u201ckawaii, but make it fascism\u201d\nDuncan Fegredo's lovely wrap cover for the softcover edition, before its colours by Jacob Phillips!\nA Simon BIsley warmup sketch, as you do; another of the sort of extras that only come in the deluxe slipcase edition\nAlso, neither Duncan nor Alex have ANY chill so we'll probably post lots of lettered pages in the updates.... but only for backers.  \nDuncan's last \"Free the 156\" stickers from MUTE, for the first 50 hardcover backers\n Who we are:\nMan; made Moon & more\nDuncan Jones is a British advertising and film director, best known for his BAFTA winning film MOON, epic game-based fantasy movie WARCRAFT and his other science fiction films SOURCE CODE & MUTE.  He is presently staying safely locked up at his home, waiting for it to be safe to go out and make ROGUE TROOPER of 2000AD fame with Rebellion Studios.  Duncan is answerable to his wife, Rodene, his two kids, Stenton 4 and Zowie 2, and his dog, who takes her privacy very seriously after a scamming incident, and wishes to remain anonymous. \nWoman; made books\nAlex de Campi is a novellist and comics writer, best known for her noir graphic novel BAD GIRLS and her love anthology TWISTED ROMANCE, both of which were nominated for three Eisner awards last year. She has also written some episodes of Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s BLADE RUNNER anime (on Toonami next year) and worked with Masamune Shirow on a GHOST IN THE SHELL comic for Kodansha. Her debut novel, medieval suspense thriller THE SCOTTISH BOY, comes out at the end of the month and you can preorder it here in the UK or here in the US. You can read her action-thriller comic BAD KARMA anywhere in the world right now, as it is pay-what-you-wish on lovely webcomic site Panel Syndicate. Alex is answerable to her daughter Lorelei and her deafblind pit bull Tango, and they\u2019re all answerable to the darn cat. Her little family is currently enjoying being the only people left in Manhattan. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks, the book is already paid for and most art is finished.

This is it: \nIt made me think, why hasn't anyone made a blacklight comic book with fluorescent ink? These colors are so bright! It would be the best looking comic book ever.\nSo I decided to make one. It's called OCTOBRIANA 1976. \nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nIt's about a badass Russian superhero/devil-woman who fights Soviet oppression and robot Stalin.\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nIt's set in the 1970s because when I think of blacklight art, I think of the 70s. Plus the story is inspired by underground comix of the 70s.\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nOctobriana comes from the book Octobriana and the Russian Underground (1971) by Petr Sadecky. It's about a subversive group of artists and writers in Kiev in the 1960s who create a western-style superhero character as an act of dissent. They made outlaw comics called samizdat (publish-it-yourself <-- reminds me of zines in the US or dojinshi in Japan) that starred Octobriana. Sadecky smuggled this material out of the USSR for his book. Since then, Octobriana has appeared in several comic books across many decades and countries. She seemed like a perfect character for American underground comix - a show of solidarity with their Russian countercultural kin. \nOf course some of that is not true. It's a great book that reminds me of things like Orson Welles' War of the Worlds and F for Fake, Spinal Tap, or H.P. Lovecraft's mythology (specifically the way other writers are free to use his creations). Here is a Cartoonist Kayfabe video that Ed Piskor and I made about Sadecky's book:\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nIn order to make this work, I'm teaming up with my frequent partner-in-creative - AdHouse Books' Chris Pitzer. Pitzer's my print guru. We first teamed up on the 1970s superhero graphic novel Afrodisiac. It featured some unusual printing/coloring/design to approximate the look of the time period: \nWe also did Street Angel: Princess of Poverty. This was the first time I worked with fluorescent ink in offset printing (the cover lettering and spine). It's not the same as other ink. For example, you need to print it twice to \"charge\" it:\nSo when I first thought about making a blacklight comic book with fluorescent ink, I talked to AdHouse Books. His expertise is the reason this is going to be the best looking comic book ever!\nREWARDS\nUPDATE!!! I've created 3 editions of the digital OCTOBRIANA 1976 - Neon, Retro, and Black-and-white! These will be sent to everyone who backs this Kickstarter starting at the $5 level! Here are samples. I'm also making comic book editions of the retro and black-and-white versions:\nREWARDS\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 - DIGITAL EDITIONS \nRead these on your computer or mobile device. Because the fluorescent color doesn't translate well to the screen, I decided to create a custom digital copy of Octobriana 1976. The coloring is different than the print edition but I tried to make it look its best for your screen!\nPROCESS: OCTOBRIANA 1976 ZINE\nThis is a cross between a how-to book and an Artist Edition. It features my script, layouts, sketches, and scans of the original art that went into the creation of Octobriana 1976.\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 - PRINT EDITION \nThis is why we're all here - 24 page, saddle-stitched comic book featuring bright, fluorescent colors! Is it the best looking comic book ever? Get one and decide for yourself. If you or someone you know loves comics, printed matter, or design - this is for you!\n UPDATE!!! I've created 3 editions of the digital OCTOBRIANA 1976 - Neon, Retro, and Black-and-white! I like how they look so I'm going to make limited print editions of the Retro and Black-and-white versions. If you've already chosen another Reward but you'd like to add these variant editions - you will be able to add them when you check out at the end of this campaign:\nBLACKLIGHT SCREEN PRINTS Signed and Numbered\nIn addition to the comic book, I'm offering signed and numbered blacklight screen prints as rewards, including the Dragon Killer print that started this journey plus an Octobriana print and Afrodisiac print - it is her Kickstarter after all! You can also get a set of all three for a nice price. Prints are 18 x 24 inches.   \nUPDATE: Afrodisiac package REWARD is now available - Octobriana 1976 comic book + Afrodisiac book + Afrodisiac blacklight screen print\nUPDATE: I have added 2 prints for a very limited 5 print set. The 2 prints are from previous print runs and limited quantities. One is a blacklight screen print based on Alexis Ziritt's comic book Space Riders. The other is a 3D screen print for Plan 9 from Outer Space. Both prints are 18 x 24 inches.\n\nART\nOctobriana drawings on comic book backing boards. The drawings pictured below are samples of what some of these backboard drawings look like. The drawings will vary since each is a unique, one-of-a-kind drawing and not a print.  Backing boards are approximately 6.75 x 10.5 inches. Media is pencil, ink, marker, paint, highlighter, color pencil, or mixed media. The backing board will be in a plastic sleeve along with your copy of Octobriana 1976 comic book. \nORIGINAL ART: STRETCH GOAL BOOKPLATE DRAWING\nThe original art for the Stretch Goal Bookplate/Signed Print. It is ink on bristol, 11 x 17 inches.\nORIGINAL ART: DRAGONKILLER\nThe original art from the Dragonkiller blacklight print is now available. It is archival ink on bristol, 18 x 24 inches.\nDetail:\nThere are a few concept drawings available as rewards. These are character drawings that I made when I was working out the designs, materials, and style of OCTOBRIANA 1976. These concept drawings are 11 x 17, ink on bristol.  \nConcept drawing 1\nConcept drawing 2\nConcept drawing 3\nThe cover art is also a Reward and 11 x 17, ink and screen tone on bristol.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\nUNLOCKED! $60,000 - Octobriana Checklist: Old school fanzine style! Where else has Octobriana appeared? I'll try to make a comprehensive list of appearances in comic books as well as real world media.\n$75,000 - Signed bookplate/print: This will be included with the Print edition OCTOBRIANA 1976 fluorescent, blacklight comic book. It will feature a new drawing and design by Jim Rugg! I'm not saying it will be from OCTOBRIANA 1986...but that was a magical year for comics. I'm sure the goddess of war had something to say about it!\nFINAL NOTE\nEventually I plan to distribute this comic book anywhere and everywhere that I can. This includes comic book shops, conventions, and online. I do not know how those details will unfold, but I want to be honest about my intentions. My goal is to make comics accessible to readers everywhere. \nThank you for your support and read more comics!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDigital copies will be delivered as soon as the funds are cleared by Kickstarter.

I.E. \u201cLook at my drip, my drip, my swag\u201d - Lil Baby.\nDrip: A collection of drawings from Shawn Crystal.\nHi, I\u2019m Shawn Crystal and I'm a massive fan of Hip Hop. As a storyteller, Hip hop has always spoken to me. Rappers used word and rhyme schemes to paint pictures and create characters with a unique style and swag, much like I do with drawings and paintings. The first time I heard hip hop it owned my soul. I grew up breakdancing and graffiti writing. Comics and Hip Hop have always shared a brotherhood, and that has influenced who I am,  for most of my life.\nI\u2019m also a comic book artist, illustrator, art educator, and podcaster. I\u2019ve worked for Marvel Comics and DC Comics for the past decade on titles such as Deadpool, Batman, Mother Panic, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Scarlet Witch (to name a few.)\nI\u2019m also the host of the Inkpulp Audio podcast, where I interview creative people and talk about their lives and art.\nMy first art book was titled \u201crepresent.\u201d  It was my debut art book and I wanted to name it after the greatest rap debut of all time, \u201cIllmatic\u201d by Nas. The book was re-presenting a few years worth of work in one new collection. Also, I wanted it to \u201crepresent\u201d me, much like the song \u201crepresent\u201d did for Nas.\nWhen it came time to title my second art book, I thought back to the growth that I have gone through, as an artist, over the past four years. I\u2019ve progressed tremendously and I am excited to share that growth with all of you. When it comes to my art,  I feel a sense of swag. The times being what they are, hip hop is full of swag\u2026 drippin hard. So \"Drip\" seemed like a natural title.\nAlso, my logo is that of an ink drop. The title \u201cDrip\u201d offered that same double meaning that I had found with my first art book. A perfect fit.\n  DRIP: The Art of Shawn Crystal\nThis art book collects work produced by me over the past four years. As an artist, this time has been a period of growth for me. For years I've been feeling like I was searching to find myself as an artist, mostly. Here, in this book, is where I finally nailed down who I am as an artist and what makes my art unique and \u201cmine.\u201d I am proudly presenting this new collection of ink drawings, pencil sketches, thumbnails, commissions, and studies in a beautifully designed edition. The book has a soft cover, measures 7.5\u201d X 11\u201d and has a CLASSY Spot gloss DRIP.\nWe have created some exciting  REWARD TIERS for you all to choose from!\nWe also have some extremely exciting STRETCH GOALS planned! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy biggest challenge will be getting the word out about this Kickstarter. I feel like I'm comics best kept secret, just like Diamond D. I am very proud of the work in this book and believe any fan of comic art will find this to be an essential part of their art library.\nMy second biggest challenge will be the commissions. I plan on working on them full time once this campaign is funded. That means I won't be taking on freelance work for that time period. In order to do that, I need to make enough money to support myself during that period. Again, any help spreading the word will drive those numbers up and make this a total success. \nMy first kickstarter campaign was fulfilled on time. I always work really hard to deliver my work on time, and this Kickstarter will be no exception! The book is completely designed and ready to hit the press. Once funded we will hit go.\nI am aiming to have everything, printed, done, and shipped out by July 2020, at the absolute latest.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Slight Chill", "descp": "Not interested in anything here, but want to help the Drip campaign?

We are Kirsten and Aiyven Mbawa and we have written 2 books which we hope to publish in April 2020 with your support. \nLet us tell you a bit about ourselves, our books and the inspiration for them. \nWe\u2019ve been reading since forever. We have also been writing from when we were about 7 or 8 years old. Our love for reading & writing started with our grandfather. He loved to read. He adored buying books, often from charity shops. So, in every home he stayed at (his in Cameroon, ours/our aunt\u2019s in Northampton or our uncle\u2019s in Ferrara), he would have stacks of books. Our mum inherited that love for reading and then writing and so did we. We also think another source of our flair for writing is our granduncle (our dad's uncle). He had a newspaper back in Cameroon called the Cameroon Post which was quite a thing its day.\nFollow this link to our YouTube Channel where you can watch some videos of us sharing our love for reading & writing by reviewing books for children, teen and young adults.\nLearn About Our Stories & Meet The Characters\nSagas Of Anya by Kirsten (12) is a work of historical fiction depicting a heart-breaking Victorian day tale which follows Anya from Cardiff to a life of drudgery in London.  Anya is 11 when mother dies. Her cosy life upends as life goes on a downward spiral. After 2 years of watching her father and her perfect life fade away, she has little choice but to head to London to be a maid at the impressive Tippets House working for the nasty Mrs. Axton. Told from a child\u2019s perspective, it charts the courageous journey of a motherless daughter beyond death and grief to become a strong, determined and independent survivor.  \nAnya\nSagas Of Anya Characters\nLand Of the Nurogons by Aiyven (10) is a gripping fantasy adventure undertaken by 4 \u201cordinary\u201d teenagers to save the world they fell into & have come to love. Through the eyes of Hayden, Canada, Rodger & Mae, you will experience the highs and lows of the quests they go on with the help of the Nurogons & Lord Nurogi to save Nurogonia. When you get to tuck into the book, you\u2019ll find friendship, loyalty, bravery and teamwork are central to this story. \nHayden\nLand Of The Nurogons Characters\nSagas Of Anya & Land Of The Nurogons Colouring Book (PDF)\nThe Inspiration\nOur books started life when Nana Juju, our nanny, encouraged us to enter the BBC 500 Words competition in early 2019. We entered the main idea for these stories but unfortunately, we didn't get a favourable reply.  Land Of The Nurogons is inspired by Rick Riordan, one of Aiyven\u2019s favourite authors, if not her favourite author. Sagas Of Anya is loosely based on our mum as our maternal grandma sadly passed away when our mum was quite young too. Anya's mum, therefore, is in honour of our grandma. \nThank you Nana Juju for encouraging us to enter the competition. Even though we didn't win, Mum and Dad encouraged us to carry on with our books, so we turned them into tens of thousands of words, let alone 500. Thank you, Mum & Dad, for supporting us and keeping us on track. Thank you Dad for getting us the laptops! Even though Mum thought it was too early at the time:-) Thank you Everyone who has supported us on this writing journey and also supported us with our book reviews. \nWe think by achieving our dream of becoming published authors, we will add more diversity to the community of writers because these stories for children & young people are being told & written by young people.\nWe are hoping to get our books published through your support for our Kickstarter Campaign so in the first instance, we will only print as many copies as are ordered through Kickstarter. When our Kickstarter campaign ends, there will be updates on any other ways of pre-ordering the books before the official release date of 18th April 2020.

Almost.... \nPunch is the unholy prow splitting the water between life and death, faith and doubt, hope and damnation.\nA heartbroken priest defies his faith and commits an unforgivable sin. He finds God and the Devil casting lots in a seedy bar for his eternal soul. There's a bar fight between God's infernal Virtues, the Hounds of Heaven, and the Devil's seven deadly sins; survivors of the homicidal pogroms perpetrated by the One God against the many. \nThe tale begins with the body of a man wrapped in plastic in the trunk of a car. Our protagonist is a Catholic priest- a haunted, unshaven preacher - The Drifter - who has just killed a man; an act so heinous that he despairs of his immortal soul. He received a confession of the dead man\u2019s sins - a confession so hideous, so monstrous, that our priest had no choice but to kill the man then and there. He rips the clerical collar from his neck and walks out into the desert, certain he'll die of exposure, which technically isn\u2019t suicide.\nHe finds a bar instead. Purgatory is a roadhouse with Satan as the bartender, fronted by seven women, his 7 Deadly Sins, while God - a filthy derelict - begs for spare change outside. The Drifter searches his pockets - finds only two coins. He throws one into the derelict\u2019s lap and enters the bar. He walks to the bar where the Devil is waiting with a drink already poured. The Drifter pays for the drink with the second coin.\nHe downs the drink. \n Throwing off his disguise as a derelict, God enters the bar. He has seven silver chain leashes in his hands - and on the end of each leash is a woman in a collar. These are the seven virtues. They wear white uniforms. The Virtues are immaculately made up and angelic - but they behave like wolves. They strain at the leash and howl like attack dogs.\nThe Devil tips his glass.\nAnd the fight begins for the Drifter\u2019s soul. Virtues vs Vice, the ultimate bar brawl between what used to pass for Good and Evil. But the Drifter isn\u2019t so sure where the lines are anymore. God smiles from behind his mirror shades and drags the howling Drifter out of the bar into the searing pitiless light of Heaven.\nBut nothing is as it seems; the Drifter plans a celestial jailbreak, and the Morning Star, cunning to the last, has manipulated events from the start. The Drifter begins to understand his position as a lever, capable of destabilizing the balance of power and rescuing the one soul he sought to avenge at the very start.   \nFive years ago, legendary comics writer Grant Morrison and I started working on an uncanny history of the once and future gods, called PUNCH. Sadly, even with the best of intentions, Grant had multiple projects in development at that time. And when HAPPY! went to FX, the heavens opened, and his already full plate was loaded up a thousand fold. That might have been the end of Punch, if not for Grant's encouragement that I continue with the script myself, and his continued enthusiasm when I inundated his poor inbox with pages and pages of high falutin' verbiage. Always listen to a legend when they give you advice, and then make them suffer for it! It took  4 years of writing and revision, and in 2019, I found myself with a sprawling 78 page script, and a quixotic \"Now What!?\" reverberating in my mushy skull.  \nEnter Kickstarter, the perfect agora to communicate with some of the most ardent comic book fans in the world. The hallowed medium via which so many indie comic book raconteurs bring their wildest and most personal stories to life! The script is written. Jonathan Marks Barravecchia, myself, and the rest of the creative team are already hard at work, thumb nailing and illustrating the graphic novel. But even with the contributions of comics and art legends like BILL SIENKIEWICZ, DAVID MACK, JASON SHAWN ALEXANDER, JIM MAHFOOD, SATINE PHOENIX, JAW COOPER AND STEPHANIE INAGAKI, there's no way we can do this without your help!\nA quick note on the \"Augmented\" graphic novel concept. \nAs we traverse each stretch goal, both the Hardcover and LTD Edition versions of PUNCH will increase in size from their original 48 pages. Each stretch goal will generate a complete Four Page increase in the size of the comic, from 48 pages to 52, 56, etc. (4 pages, fully painted, colored, and lettered) \n\nNEW $800 Variant Cover original art reward by Jonathan Marks Barrevecchia\nCasey Calvert by David Mack\nBree Daniels by David Mack\nTita by David Mack\n\n\nOlive Glass by David Mack\nV Nixie by David Mack $500 Original Art Reward\nGluttony by Bill Sienkiewicz, featuring V Nixie.

I wanted to bring my photography skills to bear on this project, so early on I decided to cast the comic as though I would a film; primarily as reference for the many artists involved, but also to create a distinctive visual scaffolding to hang the story on. An elite band of actors and models lent their prowess, personality and charisma to the characters. Jonathan Marks Barravecchia is then using the reference imagery to paint each and every panel of PUNCH by hand. In addition to making each piece of the narrative a bonafide work of art, it also creates the perfect gritty atmosphere for the story to take place.\nChristine Idiivil Reference photo by Allan Amato\nTHOMAS JANE has been in it since the beginning, as the lead character, the renegade priest known as The Drifter. \nThomas Jane by Jason Shawn Alexander\nRICKY WHITTLE, the epic lead of American Gods, is The Deceiver.  \nRicky Whittle and Ana Fox by David Mack\nJOSH BARNETT, UFC champ and bonafide superhero badass is The Derelict. \nJosh Barnett by Allan Amato\nSTOYA, OLIVE GLASS, ANA FOX, RYAN KEELY, CASEY CALVERT, PULPFICTIONALLY, V NIXIE, BREE DANIELS, KIRA NOIR, DOMINIQUE SILVER, SASH, TITA, TEA, MOXI, JIZ LEE AND CHRISTINE IDIIVIL round out the stunning cast, as the Virtues and Vices!\nPride VS Virtue (preliminary sketch) by JAW Cooper\nLuxuria (Bree Daniels) and Avarita (Ana Fox) concept sketches by JAW Cooper\nBILL SIENKIEWICZ, DAVID MACK, JASON SHAWN ALEXANDER, JIM MAHFOOD, SATINE PHOENIX, JAW COOPER AND STEPHANIE INAGAKI \nare just some of the incredible artists on board, creating epic cover art, pin ups and splash pages based on the reference images of the amazing cast.\nJAW Cooper\nBree Daniels by Satine Phoenix\n Grab an oar, and climb aboard Charon's Ferry!\nAs a first time writer and creator of graphic novels, I nonetheless intend to bring my extensive Kickstarter acumen to bear on this project.

He/she might decide that the moon is a happy place.\n\nOur factory might deliver toys later than expected, which means you'd get them a bit after the projected delivery date. We've worked with the same family of toy makers for years, so we're not too concerned about this.\n\nOur freight container could sink on its way across the ocean. That would suck.\n\nWe may add or remove designs from the JANKY series for production reasons \u2014 but we probably won't. Some of the designs, colors, and surface textures will certainly change a bit in production, but they'll still be awesome. The toy heights mentioned may not be exactly as mentioned. \n\nFinally: We can't precisely control the number of limited edition toys produced because of the way Kickstarter works, so we'll take toys down well before they sell out. In addition, Superhero backers aren't included in the count totals because their aren't too many of 'em, and they are heroes who are backing us to the core! We'll do our best to keep the numbers close to the quoted limits, of course!!\n\nBut no matter what, everything will be brilliant and YOU WILL LOVE YOUR TOYS.

Several years ago, I decided to make a series of handmade editioned books (accordion, pop-up, carousel, tunnel, and more) based on Heinrich Hoffman's \"Der Struwwelpeter.\" The children in this classic storybook collection encounter such disastrous consequences for their misbehavior, I was completely inspired!\nHand-made edition accordion pop-up book of Shockheaded Peter.\nHandmade tunnel book from The Story of Little Suck-A-Thumb\nMy books have been exhibited internationally and can be found in museum, library, and personal collections all over the world. This is wonderful. (Thank you, Maddy Rosenberg and CENTRAL BOOKING!) That said, I realized that most of my friends can rarely see, much less own, the books themselves, because handmade books are so labor intensive, are in limited editions, and exhibited in very specific venues.\nTHE STRUWWELPETER\nIn 1845 Heinrich Hoffman created Der Struwwelpeter for his son in response to what he perceived to be a lack of good children\u2019s books. The book became widely popular among children and adults. \nThe ten stories include: Shockheaded Peter (lack of personal grooming leads to unpopularity); The Story of Cruel Frederick (if you are a bully, someone will bite back); The Story of Little Suck-A-Thumb (if you suck your thumb, the evil tailor will jump through the window and chop it off);  The Story of Augustus Who Would Not Eat His Soup (if you don't eat what you are given, you will starve to death and die); The Story of the Inky Boys (a tale of racism that has been adapted for this 21st century retelling); The Story of Pauline and the Matches (if you play with fire you will burn to death); The Story of the Man Who Went Out Hunting (if you go out hunting, the animals will fight back); The Story of Fidgety Phillip (if you don't still at the table, terrible accidents occur); The Story of Johny Head in the Air (if you don't watch where you are going, accidents  will occur); and The Story of Flying Robert (if you go out in the rain, the wind will pick you up and carry you away forever.)\nTHE KICKSTARTER: TO FUND A SINGLE-VOLUME POP-UP BOOK\nI have decided to make and self-publish a single-volume collection containing all 10 stories so that everyone can have their own copy!\nTo do that, I am taking all the original artwork and re-imagining each of the original books into a single spread. Here are some samples:\nShockheaded Peter\nThe Story of Pauline and the Matches\nSample Pop-Up Spread of the Story of Johnny Head in the Air\nDIY PAPERCRAFT ACTIVITIES\nIn addition to the single volume pop-up book, I have also created coloring book pages and DIY paper craft activities so that anyone can build their own Shockheaded Peter toys, sculptures, and more. \nColoring Book Pages\nShockheaded Peter 3D Paper Craft\nANIMATIONS\nAs an added bonus, I animated each story (with music composed by both myself and the amazing Ithai Benjamin.) The animations are available from the pop-up book itself through AR or through a complete digital copy of the book.\nPLAY\n\nShock-Headed Peter Animation Description: Just look at him! there he stands, With his nasty hair and hands. [Animation of crowd staring at Peter in circus tent] See! his nails are never cut; They are grimed as black as soot; [Animation of hand with long filthy nails underneath a magnifying glass] And the sloven, I declare, Never once has combed his hair; [Animation of Peter standing before a mirror, looking quite unkept] Anything to me is sweeter Than to see Shock-headed Peter. [Animation of Peter once again in circus tent breaking through bars to the horror of onlookers shielding their eyes and faces.]\nPLAY\n\nThe Story of Flying Robert Animation Description: When the rain comes tumbling down, In the country or the town, All good little girls and boys, Stay at home and mind their toys. [Animation of traditional home in the rain] Robert thought, - \"No, when it pours, It is better out of doors.\" Rain it did, and in a minute, Bob was in it. Here you see him, silly fellow, Underneath his big umbrella. [Animation of Robert walking in the rain, carrying a big umbrella and wearing a fisherman's hat] What a wind! Oh! how it whistles Through the trees and flow'rs and thistles. It has caught his big umbrella; Now look at him, silly fellow. [Animation of Robert standing, holding his umbrella against the wind, as leaves and rain come towards him. Eventually his hat flies off.] Up he flies, To the skies. No one heard his screams and cries; Through the clouds the rude wind bore him, And his hat flew on before him. [Animation of the wind picking Robert up and carrying him off the ground.] Soon they got to such height, They were nearly out of sight! And the hat went Up so high, That it almost touch'd the sky. [Animation of Robert floating higher and higher in the air.] No one ever yet could tell Where they stopp'd, or where they fell; Only this one thing is plain, Rob was never seen again! [Animation of a tiny silhouette of Robert high in the air, off in the distance.]\nAnimation activated from Pop-Up book and playing on phone\n\nPROTOTYPES AND DEMONSTRATIONS\nLast year, I demo'd the prototypes at New York Maker Faire with the wonderfully talented Jody Culkin. Our table \"Telling Stories with 21st Century Pop-Up Books\" got a lot of attention! \nCrowd surrounding demonstration of books at Maker Faire New York\nFeatured on Make and Makezine!\nWe won both an Editor\u2019s Choice and a Best in Class ribbon! Plus, we were featured on the Make website and Gareth Branwyn wrote a lovely review on MakeZine. \nVISITING FACTORIES\nThis past fall, through the generosity of my incredible friends Matthew Belanger and Dee Hu, I got to visit printing and paper assembly factories in Guangzhou, China. I visited several factories to familiarize myself with the process, compare quality, and observe conditions. It was amazing to see the process of books being made first-hand and I picked a factory I feel really good about So ... we're ready to go.\nWith Dee at the factories!\nMY GOAL\nThe money I\u2019m raising will be used to cover the print and hand assembly costs for a minimum run of 3,000 books. The final book will be 8\"x10\"x1.25\" and will contain a scroll that is 8.4\"x33.8.\nIf the goal is met, I'll move forward -- which means signing a contract, delivering all the files complete with original art, die cuts, etc. The factory will then send me a mockup sample, and once approved the book goes into production.\nI will need to ship the books from China to the United States. I will then work with a fulfillment company which will be responsible for storing and delivering book orders. Selling 1000 books would be the minimum number of books for the fulfillment company of my choice.\nREWARDS\nThere are many rewards to choose from! \nPledge $1 or more and you will get a big Thank You!\nI am so appreciative of any and all support, and I will tell the world of your awesomeness via social media!\nPledge $35 or more and you will receive the Digital Book Pack\nA digital copy of the book (either interactive pdf or epub) version complete with animations and multimedia. \nThe digital papercraft kit (downloadable PDF file that contains 4 coloring book pages, cut and assemble Shockheaded Peter Jolly Jumper, Slat Sculpture, and 3D Sculpture.) \n(Estimated Delivery: August 2018)\nPledge $60 or more and you will receive the Book\n1 hardcover copy of the book + scroll (with animations and multimedia embededded through AR) \nDomestic and International Shipping and Handling Rates Apply (Estimated Delivery: November 2018)\nPledge $75 or more and you will receive the Complete Book Pack (this is a good one!)\nOne hardcover copy of the book + scroll (with animations and multimedia embededded through AR) \nA digital copy of the book (either interactive pdf or epub) version complete with animations and multimedia, so you can have it on your phone wherever you go. \nThe digital papercraft kit (again - the downloadable pdf file of coloring book pages, 3D paper craft, and more) \nDomestic and International Shipping and Handling Rates Apply (Estimated Delivery: November 2018)\nPledge $100 or more and you will receive The Collector Pack with Original Art (I love this one!)\nOne hardcover copy of the book + scroll (with animations and multimedia embededded through AR) \nA digital copy of the book (either interactive pdf or epub) version complete with animations and multimedia, so you can have it on your phone wherever you go \nThe Digital Papercraft Kit (again - the downloadable pdf file of coloring book pages, 3D paper craft, and more) Free shipping to the US.

Your passion and support make magic possible.\nIf you want some combination of books and rewards for which there is no tier package, just message us directly and we'll give you a customized pledge level!\nThank you for supporting...\nGreat literary works of the past, illustrated and designed by the finest graphic artists, illustrators and cartoonists in the world, presented in lush, over-sized hardcover volumes.\nAt Beehive Books, we have always admired great book-craft -- especially the beautiful turn-of-the-century volumes of fiction, poetry and prose embellished by masters like Arthur Rackham, Gustave Dore, Rockwell Kent and countless other luminaries from the first golden age of illustration. Handsome volumes with hand-sewn signatures, tipped-in plates and sterling print quality.\nSuch gorgeous illustrated literature has become a rare bird in the quick-and-dirty landscape of modern mass production. \nSo we're launching this series of classic literary masterworks, full to the brim with stunning artwork by the greatest visual storytellers in the world, in cloth-bound heirloom editions designed to be read and reread, experienced, and treasured.\nWe're partnering with three of the very finest artists working today: Paul Pope, Yuko Shimizu and Bill Sienkiewicz. We've asked each of the three what book they would most love to illustrate, and they've each come up with a fascinating choice. \nThese are dream projects for these artists -- to work with some of their favorite literature, in print volumes with the highest production values.\nSo, without further ado...\nEach edition will be designed by Ma\u00eblle Doliveux in close consultation and collaboration with its illustrator. While our concept hearkens back to the intricate book-craft of years past, these are not fusty faux-Victorian recreations of an antiquated aesthetic. These are modern high-design art objects, created utilizing the most cutting edge ideas and technologies in presentation and production. \nThey will feature:\nExpansive 9x12\" trim size\nLush, textured, heavyweight paper\nCloth binding\nA minimum of ten full-page, full-color illustrations\nDie-cut slipcases, embossed & debossed with metallic foil blocking\nDyed edges\nSome of the most beautiful artwork you'll ever lay your eyes on\nNow let's talk about our titles.\nAlgernon Blackwood is one of the most important authors in the history of weird fiction and literary horror, and his work deserves to be universally recognized. \nHis turn-of-the-century occult sagas of the natural and supernatural world had a huge impact on many 20th century masters....\n...including H.P. Lovecraft, who believed that his masterwork THE WILLOWS was the greatest supernatural tale in all of English literature.\nTHE WILLOWS is a chilling and gorgeous story of two friends rafting down the flooded Danube, and slowly becoming deranged by a mysterious force at work on the branch-choked river. But in the 110 years since its original publication, it's floated in and out of print, without the wide recognition it deserves.\nWho better than the modern master Paul Pope (BATTLING BOY, BATMAN: YEAR 100), whose energetic brush line seems to writhe and vibrate on the page, to illustrate and illuminate this tale of a raging river become astonishingly, malevolently conscious, and two human souls perched on the brink of madness?\nWith this book, we intend to create the most lavish and beautiful Algernon Blackwood edition ever produced.\nAs we're doing with Herbert Crowley in our upcoming art book THE TEMPLE OF SILENCE, we hope to pull another great genius from the brink of relative obscurity.\nBut Paul's beautiful book is only the first of the three editions available through this campaign.\nOscar Wilde's fairy tales are some of his most elegant and charming pieces of writing. \nHe produced two books of fairy tales -- The Happy Prince and The Selfish Giant. They've rarely been collected in one volume -- and never with stunning artwork by Yuko Shimizu (THE UNWRITTEN, BARBED WIRE BASEBALL), one of the modern masters of illustration and graphic art.\nWilde's original fairy tales are moving, sweet, sad and magical -- much like Yuko's artwork. Yuko is one of the most celebrated and admired editorial illustrators in the world, and her work is perfectly aligned with Wilde's witty, rueful voice.\nYuko approached us with this book in mind. She's passionate about Wilde, and eager to follow her intricate, calligraphic line deep into his enchanted world. \nAnd so are we.\nHas there ever been a better synthesis of artist and subject than the great Bill Sienkiewicz (a master of mutants if there ever was one) and H.G. Wells' classic THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU? \nBefore Bill even began work on his jaw-dropping illustrations, we knew this one would be a masterpiece. Wells' gleefully blasphemous tale of human chimeras and deranged scientific curiosity comes to nightmarish life through Billy the Sink's supreme brushwork and unmatched vision. \nBill, for the few who aren't aware, is a living legend -- the man who almost single-handedly brought fine art techniques into mainstream comics, drew many of the most acclaimed comics and graphic novels of of the last 40 years, who collaborated with Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman and Frank Miller on some of their most ambitious works. \nBill is simply one of the best visual storytellers of all time, and it's an honor to have this opportunity to work with him.\n We have produced limited edition high-end gicl\u00e9e prints of each image created exclusively for this campaign. Every print will be signed by the artist, numbered in a run of 100, and printed in archival ink on archival fine art velvet paper.\nIn order to show the vast potential of this ongoing line of Illuminated Editions, we've also commissioned additional illustrations from two of our favorite visual artists: Lisk Feng and Ronald Wimberly.\nBelow are the highly exclusive signed prints by Ron, Lisk, Bill, Paul and Yuko.\nLisk Feng's MOBY DICK illustration\nRonald Wimberly's visualization of William Blake's \"The Voice of the Devil.\"\nBill Sienkiewicz's ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU illustration\nYuko Shimizu's illustration of THE HAPPY PRINCE, one of Oscar Wilde's fairy tales\nPaul Pope's THE WILLOWS illustration\n$130,000: BOOKMARKS... UNLOCKED!!!\nLovely die-cut bookmarks for each of our three titles. We'll include all three of them them with every signed & numbered slipcase package, and as a $5 add-on for lower tier rewards.\n$150,000: DIE STRUCK PINS... UNLOCKED!\nWe want to turn Yuko's gorgeous swallow into a 1.25\" die-struck enamel pin, designed by Ma\u00eblle. A pin will be included for free with every order that includes a signed & numbered slipcase edition, as a $15 add on for lower level rewards, and as its own separate reward tier.  \n$175,000: RIBBONS!\n If we hit $170,000, every edition we produce for this campaign will be equipped with a colored soft cloth ribbon, which will allow you to keep your place in the text without unsightly dog-earing. (Have I mentioned that you're expressly forbidden from dog-earing these books? It's like removing a tag from a mattress.)\nPAUL POPE is an American artist/designer living and working in New York City.

HIs recent collaboration with Errolson Hugh/Acronym for Nike\u2019s AF1 debuted spring 2017. His media clients include LucasArts, NBC, Disney, Cartoon Network, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Conde-Naste, Kodansha (Japan), Sapporo (Japan), Dargaud Editions (France), EMI Canada, The Grateful Dead Estate, and The British Film Institute. His iconic Batman: Year 100, a science fiction take on the classic Batman origin tale, appears frequently on many Top 10 Batman story lists. In 2010 Pope was recognized as a Master Artist by the American Council Of The Arts. His short science fiction comic strip Strange Adventures (DC Comics)--an homage to the Flash Gordon serials of the '30s-- won the coveted National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award for Best Comic Book of the year. He has won 5 Eisners to date. His latest book, Battling Boy, debuted at #1 on the New York Times best-seller list, his third book to hit the NYT Top 10.\nHe is currently working on Battling Boy 2, the second book in the epic science fiction/fantasy series for First Second/MacMillan, featuring a young superhero, and also finishing Psychenaut, a book of visual essays about Jungian dream analysis, for Dargaud Editions. Battling Boy is currently in feature development at Paramount Pictures, with Patrick Osborne attached to direct.\nYUKO SHIMIZU is a Japanese illustrator based in New York City and instructor at School of Visual Arts. Newsweek Japan has chosen Yuko as one of \u201c100 Japanese People The World Respects\" in 2009. \nHer first self-titled monograph came out in 2011 (Gestalten), and her second was released from ROADS Publishing in spring of 2016. Other books include: A Wild Swan (collaboration with novelist Michael Cunningham, FSG, 2015) and a multi award winning children\u2019s book Barbed Wire Baseball (written by Marissa Moss, Abrams, 2013). \nYou may have seen her work on The Gap T-shirts, Pepsi cans, VISA billboards, Microsoft and Target ads, as well as on the book covers of Penguin, Scholastic, DC Comics, and on the pages of NY Times, Time, Rolling Stone, New Yorker and in many other publications over last ten years.\nBILL SIENKIEWICZ (pronounced sin-KEV-itch) is an Eisner-winning, Emmy-nominated artist best known for revamping the style of comic and graphic novel illustration from 1980 onward, most notably with Marvel Comics' Elektra: Assassin and his acclaimed graphic novel Stray Toasters, earning him an international reputation and cult status across media industries.\nHis work has graced the National Museum of Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; galleries in Paris, Barcelona and Tuscany; Spain's famed La Semana Negra (The Black Week) Festival; advertising campaigns for Nike, MTV and Nissan; posters for The Green Mile and 2006 Winter Olympics; and magazines such as Entertainment Weekly and Spin.\nA classically-trained painter, Sienkiewicz's renderings incorporate abstract and expressionist influences and any combination of oil painting, acrylics, watercolor, mixed-media, collage and mimeograph - previously unheard of in comics. His work has garnered numerous accolades - most notably a 2004 Eisner Award for DC Comics' The Sandman: Endless Nights, and 1995 and 1996 Emmy Award nominations for production and character design on the PBS children's TV series Where In the World is Carmen Sandiego? Elektra: Assassin swept the top comic illustration awards in the U.S., Europe and Italy, respectively, with a 1987 Kirby Award, 1986 Yellow Kid Award, and 1986 Gran Guigiri Award.\nBEEHIVE BOOKS is a Philadelphia-based boutique publisher newly founded by the artist and designer Ma\u00eblle Doliveux, and editor and author Josh O\u2019Neill, co-publisher of Kickstarter-funded Locust Moon Press projects like THE LOST WORK OF WILL EISNER and the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning anthology LITTLE NEMO: DREAM ANOTHER DREAM. \nBeehive is committed to producing book art editions of distinctive literary and pictorial works with singular design sensibilities, the highest production values, and a special emphasis on comics and graphic art.

Along with his partners at Locust Moon, Josh has raised over $300,000 over the course of his last three projects, and rewarded backers of each with very beautiful books and rewards. Armed with that experience we feel very ready to tackle the task of producing and publishing substantial, handsome volumes befitting their brilliant authors and illustrators.\n\nWe've carefully priced out expenses for domestic and overseas shipping, as well as printing costs for all books, prints and ancillary rewards. We\u2019ve arranged for the logistics of reward fulfillment. We know exactly how much money we need to get this project across the finish line. All we need is the funding necessary to finish the job.\n\nThere are more risks and challenges involved in making books with this level of production value than I can realistically list here. Don't believe anybody who tells you this stuff is easy. Problems can and will pop up in ways we can't predict. But we have the knowledge, experience and commitment to persevere through difficulties and deliver a product that meets and exceeds the exacting expectations of our audience of discerning readers and collectors.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Our Deepest Thanks and Boundless Love", "descp": "A steal for just a buck.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["20 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "An Illustrated Postcard", "descp": "You select a 4x6\" postcard of any of the five illustrations featured in this campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["25 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Yuko Shimizu Die Struck Pin", "descp": "A die-struck enamel pin, featuring art by Yuko Shimizu, designed by Ma\u00eblle Doliveux.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Illustrated Postcard Set", "descp": "All five 4x6\" postcards, featuring art by Ronald Wimberly, Lisk Feng, Paul Pope, Yuko Shimizu and Bill Sienkiewicz.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "THE WILLOWS Digital Edition", "descp": "A DRM-free digital edition of THE WILLOWS, featuring the full Algernon Blackwood text and illustrations by Paul Pope.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "FAIRY TALES Digital Edition", "descp": "A DRM-free digital edition of THE FAIRY TALES OF OSCAR WILDE, featuring the full text and illustrations by Yuko Shimizu.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "DOCTOR MOREAU Digital Edition", "descp": "A DRM-free digital edition of THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU, featuring the H.G.

Ma\u00eblle is is deeply immersed in her design laboratory (which for now is actually located in the Kickstarter's Brooklyn headquarters for the summer -- , working on this project and her own upcoming graphic novel).

Night Owl? Frequent Traveler? Napper?\nAre you working crazy hours and feeling like you never have enough time to rest?\nThe problem we face in getting high quality, uninterrupted sleep is always the same: significant lifestyle changes.\nSleep mask can be a great solution. Just put it on, block out the light, and improve the quality of your sleep.\nBut, common eye masks take a one-size-fits-all approach. They don\u2019t fit, are uncomfortable, and let light through (making it even harder to sleep).\nSo as industrial designers with over 10 years of experience, we made something better.\n  Manta Sleep Mask is designed to upgrade your sleep & life with a personalized fit.\n      Manta is the World\u2019s 1st Modular Sleep Mask with FreeFit - so it molds to fit your unique face.\nIt works for 99% of all face shapes & gives you 100% blackout for your entire sleep cycle...energizing you for wherever life takes you when you wake up.\nRegardless of your ethnicity, age, gender, nose shape, or preferred sleeping position, Manta\u2019s patent-pending adjustable modular eye contours create the perfect seal - because it\u2019s specifically tailored to you.\nSide sleeper? Belly sleeper? Back sleeper?...we\u2019ve got you covered.\n        PLAY\n\nMark Webster (Authority Hacker) \n\n          PLAY\n\nTristan King (Blackbelt Commerce) \n  Patent-Pending Modular FreeFit\nExperience the Comfort of a Personalized Fit\nWhat if, instead of losing valuable hours of sleep (not to mention cash) trying dozens of different sleep masks, you got it right the first time?\nYour work would improve, you\u2019d have more energy to go out, and your body would feel stronger.\nManta Sleep Mask\u2019s modular design, with Patent-Pending omniLAT\u2122, offers an unprecedented level of adjustability that\u2019s easy and intuitive to use.\nBecause the fit is tailored to you, there\u2019s no extra pressure on your face.\n  The Modular Eye Contours can be adjusted freely to create a customized fit for 99% of all face shapes - including yours.\n        100% Total Darkness for the Entire 8 Hours\nSleep, Uninterrupted\nWhat if you could sleep through the entire night without waking up even once? Imagine how much better rested you\u2019d feel in the morning.\nThanks to the 100% total blackout of the Manta Sleep Mask, you won\u2019t experience any light leakage, meaning you\u2019ll finally be able to sleep through the night.\nRegardless of your sleep position or the shape of your nose, Manta conforms to your face (and keeps the light out).\n  Side sleeper? Belly sleeper? Back sleeper? We\u2019ve got you covered.\n      The luxurious foam contour snugly conforms to the sides of your face, making sleep on your side & belly more comfortable.\n    There is NO light leakage with Manta.\n  Eye Contours for REM Sleep\nSpend Less Time Sleeping & Feel More Energetic\nRapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep is when your brain is repaired and renewed.\nIf you need more energy and want to feel well-rested in the morning, focus on getting more REM sleep.\nDuring REM sleep, your eyes experience rapid movements in random directions. Most sleep masks press against your face and eyes, which can interrupt this process.\nManta has specially designed eye contours that encourage REM sleep.\nBecause there is no direct contact or pressure on your eyelids, your REM cycle won\u2019t be interrupted.\n   Eye contours do not press against your eyelids, which allow REM sleep to occur.\n           Since we designed Manta Sleep Mask for ourselves, we went all out to bring you even more sleep-enhancing features.\n   No more hair-pulling. No more pain. Micro velcro will not stick to your hair.\n    Cotton interior ensures Breathability & Comfort. Manta feels Light & Cool.\n    The 2 sections of the headband are made from elastics, which give you -extra comfort- as the product will STRETCH to fit your head. Limiting the elastics to only these 2 sections prevents the entire band from stretching loose with use.\n    The total length of the product is 71cm, which will fit 99% of all head sizes. The strap is made out of plush cotton velour, so it\u2019s soft & comfortable against your head and ears.\n    Lightweight construction. Manta Sleep Mask is great to use while sitting up straight (such as on a plane).\n    The silicone grip pad on the back of the mask prevents it from slipping off your head during sleep.\n    Manta earplugs are made with memory foam to block out sound.\n    You\u2019re going to love the Manta Pouch. Its separated earplug compartment with a zipped closure ensures you\u2019ll never lose your earplugs again.\n      The mesh design has 2 advantages: \nThe pouch doubles as a laundry mesh net, so you can machine wash your eye mask without damaging it. The mesh net will significantly extend the life of your Manta Mask. \nThe pouch also airs out your Manta Sleep Mask when in storage or during your travels. This improves hygiene and prevents odor buildup.\n  ALL YOU \u2013 YOUR WANDERLUST\nWhat if you could take advantage of everything your travels have to offer, without running out of energy? Imagine how much more epic & memorable your adventures would be.\nTraveling is very disruptive to your sleep quality. Those hours on a plane and adjusting to a new time zone leave you with low energy levels.\nSeasoned travelers know that the trick is to catch sleep whenever and wherever you can - be it on the plane, bus, boat, or just a good old couch.\nUnfortunately, sleeping conditions on the road are often less than ideal.\nThat\u2019s where Manta Sleep Mask comes in.\n           PLAY\n\nMadaline Lorelle (Couple\u2019s Quest)\nALL YOU \u2013 YOUR POWER NAP\nWhat if, instead of getting coffee 3 times a day, you could get a sustained energy boost? You\u2019d feel like a \u201cmillion bucks\u201d before even pitching that major deal.\nTaking a 30-minute power nap is one of the best ways to recharge yourself in the middle of a busy day.\nDespite the short duration, you wake up feeling sharper, stronger, & ready to close the deal.\nThe problem is, your body has trouble napping under fluorescent light found in the office. This is where Manta comes in.\n          PLAY\n\nChris Kim (Hilltop Stores)\nALL YOU \u2013 YOUR ZEN\nWhat if you could escape from a day of lazy lethargy without overdosing on energy drinks? Imagine how present you\u2019d feel.\nMeditation is an exercise for the soul, leading to increased mindfulness and better rest.\nUnfortunately, distractions abound in our daily lives.\nEvery once awhile, it\u2019s important to let go and to try to clear our minds. This is where Manta Sleep Mask comes in.\n         PLAY\n\nJamon Yerger\nALL YOU \u2013 YOUR SLEEP-IN\nIf you only have one day to sleep in, the last thing you want is for the morning sun to wake you up before you\u2019re ready.\nMorning light coming in through the window is a major disruption to your sleep, especially if your body hasn\u2019t had enough time to get fully rested.\nWith our modern lifestyle of going to bed well after sunset, it\u2019s difficult, if not impossible, for our body to get enough rest before sunrise.\nAnd let\u2019s face it: we all just want to sleep in every once in awhile.\nThis is where Manta comes in.\n    PLAY\n\nBenjamin Tong (Business Owner)\nALL YOU - YOUR NIGHT SHIFT\nWhat if you could feel rested and have a social life, even while working vampiric hours? Imagine how much healthier you\u2019d be, both emotionally and physically.\nAccording to WebMD, \u201cthere is strong evidence that shift work is related to a number of serious health conditions, like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity.\u201d\nSleep disturbances and loss only worsen these conditions.\nIt\u2019s extremely important for night shift workers to create total darkness during the day - and curtains alone simply aren\u2019t enough.\nThis is where Manta comes in.\n        PLAY\n\nZak Columber (Gingerbread Marketing)\nALL YOU - YOUR LIFE (UPGRADED)\nWhat if you could maximize your life, without needing to sleep more hours? Imagine how much more productive you\u2019d be.\nWhile it\u2019s ideal to get 8 hours of sleep, let\u2019s get real: with work responsibilities, social obligations, and family gatherings getting in the way, there\u2019s no way it\u2019s happening every night.\nIn these situations, all you can do is to maximize the sleep time that you do have and to upgrade your sleep quality.\nHow rested you feel doesn\u2019t depend on just the duration of your sleep, but also on the quality of it.\nThe faster you can go into, and the longer you can stay in, REM sleep, the less amount of sleep you need.\nManta Sleep Mask upgrades your sleep quality and gets you into REM sleep faster.\n          PLAY\n\n Till Carlos (Maerketing.com)\n  You are young. You are ambitious. You are adventurous. You want to enjoy life to the fullest and experience all that the world has to offer.\nBut you can\u2019t do it unless you\u2019re getting quality sleep in between your adventures.\nYou can only work hard and play hard when you\u2019ve got an abundance of energy and vitality from a good night\u2019s sleep...or a power nap [or two].\nUsing a sleep mask is a great way to improve sleep quality. The problem is, common products on the market take a one-size-fits-all approach.\nYour face and nose shape are unique. Why shouldn\u2019t the sleep mask you use be, too?\nMost eye masks force you to sacrifice fit, comfort, or quality.\nYou shouldn\u2019t need to make sacrifices when it comes to sleep.\nSo, as product designers with over 10 years of experience, who have used dozens of sleep masks in the past 15 years of our lives, we made something better.\n                http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-full-nights-sleep-can-really-pay-offin-salary-and-investments-1411056919\n   \n                  Know someone in your life who would appreciate better sleep?

If you\u2019re not familiar with my work I\u2019m sure you have seen some of the work I have created for clients. I have worked for Nickelodeon, Disney, Atlantic Records and Fisher Price. I have also animated music videos, which have had over 2 million viewers as well as shown in galleries throughout the NYC area. That\u2019s actually where this journey began.\nPlease feel free to check out my website:\nwww.vincentscala.com\nA few years ago I had created a few silkscreen projects for a gallery show in Brooklyn. The final result was two images that have sort of become my trademark. The idea behind them was to combine two things that are sort of dorky that I loved. Well my two were Disney and horror films. The final result was the Mickey Monster and Vampire Snow White.\nSilkscreens\nGallery Show Postcard\nOriginal Concept Sketch\nMickey Monster\nVampire Snow White\nMe @ Bunnycutlet Gallery Opening !\nBunnycutlet Website!\n They both received a lot of attention and I kept getting contacted by other galleries and stores to have prints made for them, especially of the Mickey. The PIQ store in Grand Central Station used the image as the poster for their own Mickey Show. \nPIQ Poster\nPIQ Store Mickey Show\nPrint Run\nRecently I have been thinking about taking this piece a step further. Something that\u2019s not just on your wall, but a physical Mickey Monster. I want to have this created into an actual toy. A vinyl figure with 3 points of articulation (moveable head and arms).  \nVinyl Colors Part 2\n I love collectible toys, and I love the idea of sharing my love of toys as well as for the Mickey Monster image with everyone is what brings me here today. Knowing that people like this image and character so much that they would want to have it on their shelf or desk is exactly why I love being an artist.\nStudio Space\nVinyl Toys\n3D Printed Prototypes\nUnfortunately creating a toy is not so easy, and the cost of the mold and high order quantities and shipping. So basically the whole process is far from cheap. Having a large community of people who would be interested in having this toy would be the best way to help make this come alive. Not only would I be getting to have one of my favorite pieces created as a vinyl toy, but also I would be able to share it with the world. \nSo Where Does the Money Go? If you are wondering who and what would need $7000 to create a toy, then look no further! Hope this helps answer some questions/concerns.\nThe most expensive portion of this venture is the mold. The mold gets created of of steel before being poured and spun with liquid vinyl. The molds are made out of steel. Since this is a complicated figure, the mold was a little pricey.\nThe second largest cost of creating this figure is the MOQ or minimum order quantity. The lowest amount I was able to have created to even have a factory look at this project is 1000 pieces. That seems like a lot of toys and it is!, but after all is said and done with the kickstarter hopefully there will not be many left !\nHere is a breakdown of the costing of a Vinyl Figure !\nFunding Breakdown Funding Breakdown\n$$ Funding Breakdown\nPlease check the tiers below and I promise you will not be disappointed, I want to make this worth everyone\u2019s wild and I am going to throw as much as I can into each category so that you get some really cool stuff at really low support prices.

None of it actually considers the needs of your head.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing you the Purple\u00ae Pillow, the world\u2019s first pillow that\u2019s more like a bed for your head! \n   How Does It Work? \nThe Purple\u00ae Pillow is made of three parts:\nPurple\u2019s patented Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 (the stretchy purple stuff) is organized in hundreds of little triangles. Unlike most pillows that might go flat and lose shape, the triangles give the core of the pillow lateral strength so it retains its oh-so supportive, head-cradling comfort all night. You never have to readjust or fluff, and your head doesn\u2019t sink or shift. SCIENCE! \nPurple includes an adjustable air booster if you want to add a little extra height to your pillow. This is great for side sleepers and snorers, making the Purple\u00ae Pillow perfect for just about anyone. \nThe Purple\u00ae Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 and air booster fit perfectly inside a super soft cover. The cover is made from polyester to make it gentle on your face, breathable so you don't sleep hot, and stretchy so your head can sink into the squishy Purple goodness.\n Every time you share Purple on social media, the Sleepy Scientist will save a Wookie! Support Purple (and Chewbacca) by taking 2 seconds to share the Purple\u00ae Pillow with your friends! \n               Who Needs a Purple\u00ae Pillow? \nAnyone who sleeps or has a head.\nThe traditional idea of a \u201cpillow\u201d isn\u2019t working. They\u2019re lumpy, flat, hot, and lack proper neck support.\nWe didn\u2019t treat the pillow like an accessory to your mattress, but as a mattress in and of itself\u2014a bed for your head.\nThe head has its own set of needs: \nYour 8-10 pounds of precious cargo need to be supported and comfortable \nYour shoulder needs some strain relief \nYour neck needs gentle, yet firm support \nYou need breathability so your head stays cool all night \nYou need a pillow that keeps its shape so you aren\u2019t waking up and readjusting \nWe reimagined the \u201cpillow\u201d as a \u201chead bed\u201d and used the same revolutionary material that has worked so well for so many people in our Purple\u00ae Bed to create it.\nWhat\u2019s the Purple\u00ae Bed? \nThe Purple\u00ae Bed is the first product we launched on Kickstarter exactly one year ago. The response to our launch has been so overwhelmingly positive, and the warm welcome we received on Kickstarter encouraged us to come back with our new, game-changing product.\nThe mattress is made with a layer of Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122\u2014a super stretchy, super durable, non-toxic, food-grade material that we invented to give people the perfect balance of support and comfort they need in a mattress.\nThe Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 is arranged in a grid system we call the Smart Comfort Grid\u2122. This grid system creates small columns all over the mattress that help support your body while allowing your pressure points to relax into the mattress.\nThis is all wrapped in a super stretchy and soft cover to make the perfect mattress. And now we have the perfect pillow to match! \nRevolutionary Technology & Design, You Say? \nIndeed!\nUnlike most pillows, our Purple\u00ae Pillow isn\u2019t a bunch of old, ineffective materials smashed together in an uncomfortable, lumpy rectangle. Instead, we took the game-changing material in our mattress, Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122, and optimized it for your head.\nThe pillow is 24\" long, 16\" wide, and about 3\" tall without the booster. The optional air booster adds up to two extra inches of height. \nWarning: This pillow is not for pillow fights! It weighs about 10 pounds, and that\u2019s a good thing because weight equals quality. Purple is heavy because we use the highest quality materials to make our ultimate comfort technology. \nPurple believes all sleepers deserve a great night\u2019s sleep, so we wanted to make the Purple\u00ae Pillow customizable. That\u2019s why we included an air booster that can be inflated to raise the pillow to your desired height. \nThis is great for side sleepers or snorers who need a little extra boost (see what we did there?) when they sleep. No matter how you sleep, your neck should always be in beautiful alignment with the Purple\u00ae Pillow!\nThe material on the outside of the pillow (or head bed, as we like to call it) is super soft and comfortable. It is made from polyester. This fabric makes your pillow ultra-touchable and super stretchy, so your face feels like it\u2019s being hugged by a panda bear while your head comfortably relaxes into a pool of Purple awesome. \nPurple vs. Other Pillows \nNeck support completely evacuates to either side of your head, forcing you to fluff all night.\n  The Wedge causes neck strain so your spine can't be in perfect alignment. Ouch!\n  Too much neck support means neck and shoulder pain so you look like an evil henchman the next day.\n  Not enough or too much neck support\u2014either way you wake up sweaty from the hot memory foam.\n  The Purple\u00ae Pillow perfectly cradles your cranium while supporting your neck without you needing to readjust.\nWhat\u2019s In It For Me?\n   What Are Other People Saying About Purple? \n\"Purple is one of the most unique mattresses I have tested to date. A combination of a Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 and two layers of polyurethane foam come together for a feel unlike any other. There are great levels of support, comfort, bounce, and exceptional cooling. Purple does a nice job of relieving pressure points in addition to minimizing motion transfer across the mattress.\" - Sleepopolis Review, 4.7 Stars\nHow Purple, Uber and Airbnb Are Disrupting and Redefining Old Industries - Entrepreneur\n3 Highly Memorable Product Demos That Made Their Brand - Inc.\nCan't Fall Asleep or Stay Asleep? 6 Products That Will Change Your Life - Lifehack\nPurple Is Better Than Any Mattress at Macy's, Walmart or Costco - Clapway\nWhy Kickstarter? \nStep one in our mission to bring comfort to everyone in the world was the Purple\u00ae Bed. We were blown away by the incredible support we got from the Kickstarter community and for the mattress after our campaign ended. Clearly, we are addressing a problem millions of people are experiencing every day: bad, uncomfortable sleep that affects their health, productivity, and happiness.\nWith the Purple\u00ae Pillow, we begin step two. We are calling on our community of innovators on Kickstarter to help us launch this new, unique product. We can\u2019t do this without your support, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve come back to Kickstarter, to share the next step in our comfort mission with you first. \nHistory of Purple \nIn 1989, two brothers, engineers Tony and Terry Pearce, partnered to change the world.\nTony\u2019s 13 years of experience in advanced aerospace materials, and Terry\u2019s 20 years of experience in manufacturing, design, and project management, led to a partnership creating high-tech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs.\nThe Pearce brothers created technology that was used in products by Nike, Johnson & Johnson, and Hill-Rom. But, eventually, the Pearces set out to create a technology that could revolutionize cushioning at a much lower cost. Purple began to evolve through a series of discoveries and product developments. The first breakthrough came in 1996, when the Pearces invented Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122.\nThis amazingly soft, yet strong material could stretch 15 times its resting size, was uber-durable, and never took a body impression. The key discovery came when Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 was molded in a shape that could \u201crelax\u201d under pressure points, redistributing the pressure to other areas. The same feature turned out to give amazing back support in mattresses.\nThree years ago, the Pearces set out to combine all their knowledge of cushioning into the world\u2019s best mattress. The Pearce brothers use custom designed and built machinery to make Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 in the USA at production rates that allowed them to significantly cut the cost of this miracle material to consumers. \nThe Purple\u00ae Bed was born! And just as the Pearce brothers dreamed it would be, it is better than any $4000 mattress and costs significantly less. That was the goal, and Purple achieved it!\nWhy Purple? Well, why not? It is an awesome color, and it signifies treating everyone like royalty. The Pearces have spent most of their high-tech careers advancing the world of cushioning. With the Purple\u00ae Bed, and now Purple\u00ae Pillow, they have put all they\u2019ve learned into the world\u2019s greatest sleep products, and they figured out how to do it so everyone can afford it.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter endeavor has its risks and challenges\u2014you just don\u2019t have many with us! \n\nProduction has already started. We\u2019ve built the molds and machinery for our initial launch, and a portion of the money we raise here will go to fund the production of more molds and machinery so we can continue making Purple in the USA at our Alpine, Utah factory.\n\nProduction time will be our biggest challenge, as we do make all of the Purple for all of our products at our factory. However, we are guaranteeing the first 1,000 will be delivered by Christmas! Another portion of our funding will be used to grow our Purple team to meet production demands.\n\nAnother challenge might be working with our product partners to get certain international components to the factory in time to hit delivery deadlines. However, we\u2019ve worked hard over the last several months to build up these relationships and plan accordingly. We expect to hit all of our delivery deadlines with the launch of the Purple\u00ae Pillow.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Virtual High Five", "descp": "Show your support for Purple with a dollar gift!

This book sets out to promote personal responsibility by answering the question: \"What would happen if we just didn't clean-up?\"\nThe misadventure unfolds when two siblings let their messy room become so out-of-control that it explodes from their doorway, sends them to the top of a toy mountain, spins them around in a dust-tornado, and much more.  \nI have always been enamored by pop-up books because of their unique ability to interact with the reader and make them an active participant in the story. This subject lent itself so well to the medium because the mess could literally rise and fall from the pages. \nNearly two years ago I set out on this exciting journey to write, illustrate, and paper-engineer this book. To find the time, I began waking up early at 5am and dedicating at least one hour everyday to the project. \nTo share in the experience, I documented every step of the process on social media. With each new post I've received support from people all over the world who have shared their suggestions and constructive feedback. All the encouragement has motivated me to not only complete the project, but to pour everything I had into this book and create something really unique and lasting.\n     > click the links below <\n        I've been working as a Greeting Card Artist and Senior Product Designer for over a decade. It's a fantastic job that is very creative, rewarding, and a joy to go to everyday. Being a creative professional though does mean that you are always working for the client and as a result your work can sometimes feel like an extension of someone else's vision. That is what inspired me to begin this journey.\nMy biggest inspiration though, by far, is my family. They inspired me to write this story in the first place and dive head first into this massive undertaking. My wife and children are everything to meeeeaaaghhhhh!!...Seriously?!? That's like the fifth Lego I've stepped on.\n  Pop-up books require a specialized manufacturer that is both skilled and dedicated to producing movable books. I had to learn this lesson the hard way after the first edition of my first self-published book, 'A Day in Rehoboth Beach' was constructed poorly. For the second printing of that book, an industry professional referred me to an outstanding manufacturer that produces Pop-up books for many large publishing houses.\n'A Day in Rehoboth Beach' sold over 4,000 copies\n  Their quality of product is outstanding and they have already quoted this book and agreed to be the manufacturer of 'What a Mess' when we successfully fund. \nAll files have been prepared for production\n Why a physical book over digital? \nDigital is great, don't get me wrong! But there is also something so magical about the tangible. When the reader is not separated by a plate of glass they can actually play an active role in the action, and experience real dimension without computer special effects.  I look at screens all day long but 'before-bed-story-time' with my kids is a time where we can unplug and bond over a great book. \nManufacturing, Shipping, and Fees. That's it! I've covered everything else up until this point and will continue to take care of marketing and promotions entirely myself. I just really need your help to get us over the hurdle of our production costs.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI have received overwhelming online support since this project's inception, so I wanted to make this book available to this community first. \nAll the reward extra's will only be available through KickStarter.\nFinding a publisher that invests in complex pop-up books is difficult. These books have a high production cost and take up more shelf-space in book stores. \nSelf-publishing gives me the opportunity to really connect with my audience and the freedom to be as creative as possible. \nDo you love this project and would you like to see it succeed? GREAT...ME TOO! Funding will play a big part in this books success but we can't get there unless everyone knows about it. This is where I desperately need your help!  Tweet, Facebook, blog, email, Instagram, and scream it from the rooftop. Every little bit helps!\nwww.MessyPopUp.com\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\n    A very special THANK YOU to: my amazing and supportive wife, Kristen; my hilariously fun children, Maggie & Charlie; my amazing copy editors Jill Jankowski and Rick Reising; and to everyone who has followed along and given so much support. I Love you all!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately I have learned a great deal from my first self-published pop-up book, 'A Day in Rehoboth Beach.' I now have an outstanding manufacturer that is proven and trusted, a logistics company that handles import and shipping, and I have a great deal of experience with fulfillment of orders. \n\nThere are many advantages to self-publishing but with it can carry some challenges. Funding is the largest challenge because of the high production costs associated with Pop-Up Books, but with your help we can easily overcome that hurdle with this Kickstarter campaign. \n\nThis first edition run will be anywhere from 1,000 - 3,500 books depending on how well we fund. Because these are modestly sized print runs for our manufacturer, our book will most likely not be their highest priority and may take longer to produce. My last book took roughly 4 months to manufacture with 2-4 weeks added for shipping and distribution. The manufacturer promised a similar production span for 'What a Mess.'

Some of you may or may not know that we started this company just two years ago right here on Kickstarter. Since then, we've been fortunate enough to serve thousands of customers from all over the world and make some incredible friends along the way. \nWe pride ourselves on making an incredible, all-natural and healthy snack that people love, but we also take feedback to heart. Given that, we understand that there are hundreds of jerky purists, if you will, that are on the search for some good old fashion, classic beef jerky flavors. That's why we're here. Over the past several months we've worked to develop three brand new recipes that pay homage to the classic jerky flavors you know and love, but also maintain our high standard of quality. \nThe Lineup.\nWhen we sat down to start work on this project we really didn't have to think too awfully hard about which three flavors we'd be adding. I think it goes without question that there are a few flavors that come to mind when someone thinks of beef jerky. \nTraditional: A marinade of gluten-free soy, Worcestershire, fresh garlic and our blend of house spices put this leagues ahead of grocery store jerky.\nTeriyaki: A classic flavor among so many people for the sweet and savory Asian flare, we've put our own twist on an authentic teriyaki recipe that's sweeter than our Sriracha Teriyaki offering with just a touch of ginger. \nCracked Pepper & Sea Salt: A personal favorite when considering options for jerky in general, we put a spin on our own Original marinade and finished the jerky with coarse sea salt and freshly ground peppercorn. \nPeople love us. \nNo, seriously. We've been completely overwhelmed over the past two years with the growth that we've experienced and the incredible feedback customers have given us. Please take a moment to visit our Facebook page and check out the awesome reviews. Keep in mind, these are always unsolicited and we cannot remove or modify them. \nYou guys are already in business, why Kickstarter?\nThis is certainly true. We've been in business for about two years and have seen incredible growth. So why are we turning to Kickstarter again? Simply put, things are expensive! Since we started the company we've expanded our product offering to 9 flavors of jerky, a bottled spice rub and two different hot sauces. This all requires a great deal of up-front costs when factoring in package production, FDA compliance, product development and obviously inventory. \nWhile we certainly won't lie and say that there's zero way we could make this happen, we can make it happen much quicker with the help of Kickstarter.  This is also the incredible thing about this platform, each of you gets to decide whether you'll support the project or not- creating the ultimate consumer driven market! \nThe Swag.\nAs always, we love to bring you more than just incredible jerky. We love that people all over the world want to rep our brand and we'll always strive to bring you the highest quality gear to make that happen. \n We've rolled out a brand new backer badge for this campaign that you'll only be able to get here. This will be included as stickers, t-shirts and Koozies\u2122. For anyone that's grabbed one of our shirts in the past, you know we only use the highest quality materials. \nStretch Goals\nWe funded in less than 50 hours! We obviously wanted to add some stretch goals to entice you guys to bump up those pledges. Our first one comes in at $20,000, check it out below. \n$20,000\nThis is something we've had a request for several times over the past two years. Many of you know our jerky and know that our Traditional Mojo is one of our best-sellers. Well, if our campaign hits the $20,000 mark we're going to develop a Mojo Spice Rub for use in all of your dishes at home. \nThis will allow you to easily add that classic garlic, lime, cilantro and our special blend of spices to any dish! We'll give every single backer a 2oz. sample bag and we'll make full spice rub bottles available for purchase.\nFollow Along. \nInterested in how we're doing?

Our friends, families and customers all started asking the same question...\nWe have to admit that at first we didn't know what to say because, well, we didn't know much about Bernie Sanders or his campaign... and we'd already declared our support for Hillary rather publicly. \nBut we couldn't deny that the more we learned about Bernie the more we started falling in love with him. Because he'd say things like this:\nHe reminded us how it feels to dare to dream big! And as makers of idealistic action figures, we were suddenly faced with an unexpected dilemma - there were suddenly TWO candidates who we really liked for totally different reasons.\nWhat to do?\nThe night of the Iowa caucuses, we got together our little creative team and held a mini-caucus. The question on the table - \"Do we make a Bernie Action Figure too?\"\nOn the one hand, it feels like cheating. We did kind of promise our loyalty to Hillary last year and we've even been sending dollars to her campaign. But on the other hand, we're not married to her (that honor goes to Bill, of course) and it's impossible to deny that we've got some chemistry with Bernie so...\nWe decided not to decide. Instead, we'd let the people vote! \nAfter all, who are we but a bunch of lefty artists in a Brooklyn bubble? (Side note - do you know where Bernie's really from?)\nSo here we are, people. This is the plan... \nWe are giving Bernie the full Kickstarter treatment, just like we did with Hillary last February. No expense was spared!\nWe brought back Mike Leavitt, the famous Seattle pop-artist who sculpted Hillary!\nWe made a really funny commercial for him! (we think so anyway)\nWe did a complete Bernification of the packaging, including his own spiffy logo.\nWe gave him his own clever tagline - \"A Join-the-Action Figure\"  \n Following the Kickstarter campaign, we'll set up a website to sell Bernie Action Figures. For every figure sold on that site, we will send $1 to the real Bernie's campaign!  (Please note that funds raised on Kickstarter will not go to the campaign as that would be a violation of Kickstarter's policies.)\nWhat we've got in mind is not unlike what Tom's Shoes does, but for political campaigns... a cool, creative way for small businesses and regular people to team up and take on a big issue.\nIf we're successful in getting this campaign funded, we will be guaranteed of having an action figure of the Democratic nominee so we'll be able to keep building our fun little movement all the way to the White House!\nA special thank you to our early supporters...  -  Kristen Cosgrove  -  Joven Castillo  -  Angie (Smarty) Maloney  -  Kathleen D.

We need it to see\u2014when in cars, when finding keyholes, even when we\u2019re outdoors. We have noticed that many everyday carry, or EDC, essentials are too dull, and current EDC flashlights are too big and bulky, so we set out to create our own.\nIt all started when I needed a flashlight one evening after I dropped my phone under my car. I immediately needed a light but did not have one. I thought to myself, \"It would be great to have a flashlight, but the size of a bullet.\"\nInspired by the 9mm round.\nA sleek, minimal, and beautiful design, we present to you BULLET, providing a strong LED mini flashlight in its most minimal form, while eliminating bulky flashlights from your everyday carry. Minimize your life. \nEveryday Carry Done Right\nWe believe that your everyday carry items are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET\u2019S functionality, beauty, and minimalism make it the best everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available. The easiest way to carry your flashlight is on your keys! Save the space in your pockets for what truly matters.  \nA quick quarter rotation on the head of the BULLET to turn it on, and a quick rotation back to turn it off. We wanted to get rid of unnecessary buttons to keep it slick and precise. A built in key chain allows you to carry BULLET with you everywhere you go.\nBullet clipped on a backpack.\nAvailable in Matte Black, Gunmetal, and now Blue!\nWe took the smallest, sleekest possible design, and combined it with aircraft-grade aluminum and an anodized finish to bring you a powerful tiny LED light, perfect for everyday use. We believe that the shape, and size kept the design minimal, functional and easy to carry, completely hassle-free in any situation.\nMeasuring in at an incredible 10.5mm x 30mm and weighing only 6 grams, BULLET is the perfect size flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 15 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. \nWhy BULLET?\nWe like keeping things simple, and easy to carry around everywhere you go. What makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day.\n Compared to other alternatives, the choice is simple.\nPLAY\n\nDesigned with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized finish, the BULLET is built for any situation possible. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, the BULLET will illuminate in any weather, helping solve any problem. \nAn LED light is ideal for everyday use over a long period of time. Never worry about breaking the light, since no glass or filament is used, or replacing it, since LEDs can last a lifetime. Battery's also last much longer with LED light, saving you both time and money in the long haul. \nWhat is an LED you ask? Well, for all you who don\u2019t know, LED\u2019s are the most efficient kind of light bulbs out on the market today. One small bulb can last you anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 hours. Of course you'll still have to replace the batteries periodically.\nWe went through many iterations, finishes, and housings for the design of BULLET.\nWe decided to use the bottom twist due to the leverage provided by the key ring. By holding onto the keyring, twisting to turn on was easiest. Furthermore, the triangle ring offered increased stability when on a keychain.\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 1\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 2\nOriginal Prototype Rendering 3\nSPECIFICATIONS\nWeight: 6 Grams\nWidth: 10.5mm\nLength: 30mm\nMaterials: Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy\nBattery: LR41 Button Cell\nType of Bulb: LED 5mm\nSpecial Features: On/Off Twist Setting, and Mini Keyring Attached\nColors: Matte Black/ Gunmetal\n    Slughaus is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional, all at the same time.

Scratch what we just said, it does TWO things well.\n Looks cute\n Makes tea\nDid you know that sea otters will hold hands with one another so they don't drift away while sleeping? COME ON! So cute. Total fact.\nWhat is the Tea Otter?\nThe Tea Otter Chilling in a Mug\nThe Tea Otter is a 100% food-grade silicone steeper that comfortably holds a healthy teaspoon of loose-leaf tea. It is heat-safe, non-toxic, lead-free, BPA-free, dishwasher safe, easy to use, easy to clean, easy to love.\nSimply pop open the Tea Otter, loosely fill with tea, hang him over the side of your mug, and pour hot water over the steeper. Let your tea sit and steep. Remove your Tea Otter. Enjoy! \nUsing the Tea Otter\nSteeping Your Tea\nTo clean, pop the Tea Otter open again, give him a quick rinse and let him dry on a warm, comfy rock.\nCleaning the Tea Otter\nA Friend at the Office.\nFits Mugs Small to Tall\nRewards:\nBacker Rewards for Supporting the Tea Otter\nHow did we design the Tea Otter?\nDesigning the Tea Otter\nGAMAGO has a 15-year history of character design. The Yeti, Ninja Kitty, Kaiju, the Deathbot - we invented all these characters & more back in our days as a iconic clothing brand. A couple years back we shifted our focus to consumer products. Fingerstache temporary tattoos? That was us. Buddha Butter Dish? The Flipper Guitar Spatula? Beer Goggles? Kitty Breakfast Mold? Shark Jaw Bottle Opener? All us. Our culture of iconic character design has informed all of the products we've made.\n360 Degrees of 100 Percent Tea Otter\nGAMAGO senior product designer, Chip Beal, was tasked with bringing the Tea Otter to life. He started (as always) with pencil on paper sketching. Chip's childhood affection for sea otters served him well - as did several hours in front of the Monterey Bay Aquarium's mesmerizing Otter Cam. \nAfter snapping out of what can only be described as an otter-induced hypnosis, Chip's sketching quickly took shape. We then rapidly moved through the process of prototyping. Fit and finish, functionality, durability - we were soon well-pleased by the samples we were receiving from our long-time manufacturing partner. \nWe are now ready to complete mold tooling and move into production. To do so, we need your help. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nGAMAGO is a small San Francisco business. We design, manufacture, promote, sell, warehouse, and distribute all of our products ourselves. Like all small businesses, we have to make hard choices on what to invest in.\nWe love the Tea Otter - but the idea came to us late in our seasonal development cycle. We had the choice of delaying the product until the Fall of 2016 or to pursue crowdfunding now to bring it to market earlier. If we meet our $10,000 Kickstarter goal, we will be able to deliver this product to our backers in May. \nTea Otter Production Timeline\nWhat's GAMAGO all about?\nGAMAGO is a native San Francisco consumer products design company. Our 11-person team has created and brought to market hundreds of products with character. We do all of the design, sales, warehousing, and shipping of our original products straight out of San Francisco's SoMa neighborhood.\nChris and Greg, GAMAGO's Co-founders\nThe GAMAGO Team\n Stretch Goal\nStretch Goal - Limited Edition Tea Turtle\nIf the Tea Otter project exceeds its goal significantly & hits $30K, then we will be able to start production of a very limited edition colorway of our as-yet-to-be-released Tea Turtle. We will unlock this reward at $30K.\nBut Wait, What about Actual Otters?\nGah!\nKickstarter's rules do not allow a project to fundraise for charity. We understand the motivation behind this rule. We also understand that we like otters. Before we started this project GAMAGO sent $250 to the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Sea Otter program. On February 14th we will send another $500. \nSea Otters are an endangered species with a decreasing population. For more information, we strongly encourage you to visit the website of our friends at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\nWant to Learn More?\nVisit our website at GAMAGO.com for more information on the history of GAMAGO and the products that we've designed.\nYou can also follow us on Facebook\nOr on Instagram\nOr on Twitter\nWe love hearing from our backers, feel free to message us on Kickstarter or email us directly at: helloyeti@gamago.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile it's impossible to predict all of the potential challenges to manufacturing and shipping the Tea Otter, we believe that we're in an excellent position to deliver our product on time. \n\nWe've successfully designed and manufactured hundreds of products of similar complexity.

All new Pebble watch bands include a quick-release pin, letting you swap bands in under 10 seconds. Now it's super easy to find the perfect style for you!\nFor DIYers, accessory makers and advanced customizers, we'll be publishing the 3D data you'll need to create amazing straps, covers and docks. \nPebble Time comes in three colors: \nBlack watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel\nWhite watch case and silicone band with silver PVD stainless steel bezel\nRed watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel\nPebble Time Steel is available in three stainless steel finishes:\n\nSilver with a stone leather band\nGunmetal black with a black leather band\nGold with red leather band\nAll Time Steels come with both a leather and matching metal band.\nSpecial Engraving for Kickstarter Backers\nAll reward watches are engraved with \u2018Kickstarter Edition\u2019. For those who are backing Pebble on Kickstarter for the second time - thank you! Your Pebble Time watch will be engraved with something extra special.\nWe've been making smartwatches for almost 7 years now. Our ultimate goal is to make Pebble an indispensable tool in your daily life by helping you accomplish more each and every day. \nWhile developing software for the original Pebble, we uncovered an important problem: apps are an inefficient way to interact with a smartwatch. As we increased functionality by adding more apps, our Pebbles clogged up. It became harder to quickly find the app we wanted. No one wants to manage another homescreen!\nTo make Pebble infinitely more useful, we needed an expandable system for organizing information and interactions. Luckily, the answer was right up our sleeves.\nIt turns out the best interface for any watch...is time!\nPLAY\n\nYou already plan your day around time, so it makes sense for your Pebble to be organized around the same principle. Now your notifications, news, reminders and events are laid out chronologically instead of being trapped inside separate apps.\nWith one click, see what\u2019s coming up next. Your timeline connects to calendars, alarms, and apps, organizing all kinds of relevant information along with quick actions. Similarly, recall the past. Scroll back in time to see that email you missed, your step count for the day or the score from the game last night. \nYour timeline takes an incredible amount of information and makes it super easy to access. \nThis is the new app menu, featuring new app faces with glanceable content. With timeline we've also created a system that dynamically loads and caches apps as needed, letting you access as many apps as you need.\nAs with all Pebble software, we\u2019ve built an open platform. You can allow apps and developers to add \u2018pins\u2019 to your timeline, so you can keep track of things like upcoming events, sports, weather, traffic, travel plans, pizza specials and more.\nThe Pebble operating system has been re-imagined with a new visual style. While all existing Pebble apps will still work great, we\u2019re inviting developers to upgrade their apps to support color. More details coming soon!\nSimplicity and focus, without compromise\nWe\u2019ve added all these new features - color screen, microphone, slimmer design and timeline - without compromising what you love most about Pebble:\nAlways-on, daylight readable screen with a great backlight\nUp to 7 day battery life (Time Steel battery life is up to 10 days)\nUse any standard 22mm watch band\nWater resistant and durable \nTactile buttons for easy eyes-free clicking \nSilent vibrating alarms\nStep tracking with Misfit and Jawbone\nLanguage and international character support (Chinese coming soon!)\nTimeline will work on Pebble and Pebble Steel (exact date TBD)\nWorks with iOS 8 on iPhone 4s and above\nWorks with all Android 4.0+ phones including Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more\nIf you\u2019re already part of our community of backers, developers and, early adopters, that\u2019s fantastic! If not, we invite you to join those who have supported and guided our journey so far. It's pretty straightforward, just back this project!\nWe pledge to do the absolute best we can at creating amazing products and supporting them for as long as possible. We\u2019ve gone out of our way to develop new features, release software updates and provide technical support for all Pebble owners. Check out our Amazon reviews or our Twitter's @Pebble and @PebbleHelp to get a taste.\nDeveloper community\nSince the first Kickstarter campaign, developers have been an integral part of the Pebble community. We are very proud of the 26,000+ developers who have created over 6,500 apps and watchfaces for Pebble.\nPebble Time greatly expands possibilities for wearable apps, building on top of the existing Pebble SDK and tools:\nRich C SDK for apps and watchfaces running natively on the watch, even when the phone is disconnected\nBest in class online development environment: www.cloudpebble.net\nNew emulator that can be used on CloudPebble or locally\nRich set of APIs: accelerometer, compass, bluetooth messaging, background tasks, GPS and HTTP request, etc\n(NEW) Color APIs to support the 64 colors of the new Pebble Time screen\n(NEW) Support for PNG and APNG\n(NEW) Timeline APIs to push information from the web into the user\u2019s timeline (no watch or phone apps required)\n(NEW) UI framework to create beautiful applications that take advantage of color and animations\n(Later in 2015) Voice to text APIs: add voice recognition to your apps\n(Later in 2015) Smart accessory port for hardware hackers.\n(Later in 2015) Bluetooth Low Energy API. Use Pebble to control BLE-enabled objects. \nAll existing Pebble apps are compatible with Pebble Time and apps built with the new SDK are compatible with both platforms. We will reveal more information about the new APIs during the campaign. Stay tuned!\nTime for one last plug: we're hiring!\nOver the years, we've hired a bunch of folks from our community and are looking to hire more! If you (or a friend!) are passionate about bringing wearables to the masses, want to push Pebble to the next level, and love working with an awesome team at an innovative company, check out our Jobs page!\nWhy are we back on Kickstarter?\nPebble was brought to life by 68,929 backers who supported our vision three years ago. Even though we've grown tremendously since then, we're still a small company battling some of the largest competitors in the world. We believe that this is the best and most efficient way for us to get our latest product to the people who want it most: people like you.\nHelp us by sharing Pebble Time with your friends!\nKnow someone who would be just as stoked as you are about Pebble Time?

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

After sending drawings to his Twitter page for about 6 months, I was thrilled when two spots opened up to work on the film. I was excited but I had no demo reel to send in, so I sent him the first couple of scenes from The Circus.  Later that day the Bakshis wrote back and said they liked my animation, but were considering a few other people for the job.  I was on edge.  Fortunately, in a few hours they wrote back and told me they had decided to hire me.  I was over the moon!\nIn many ways The Circus is an experimental film.\nFor this cartoon I adopted a policy of \"anything goes.\"  I purposely left out anything resembling a plot to focus purely on the animation.  Since the cartoon is traditionally animated it still makes for an entertaining product, even without a script or voice actors .\n  Because the film is independently produced I can try new techniques, character designs and ideas with total freedom.  I can experiment with the way I put a scene together. When I started this film over a year and a half ago, I told myself \"if you start working now, when this film is finished you will truly be an animator.\"   \nMany paths to a finished scene.\nThere is no one way to create a scene in The Circus.  Some scenes are planned and some are spontaneous.  In the elephant sequence, I studied photographs and video of baby elephants to capture the wild energy of a baby elephant at play.\nThis scene with the character taking his seat in the audience was first storyboarded in pencil.\nIn contrast, the scene where the fellow gets his burger snatched away had no planning and was animated right into the computer.\nThe dance scene was done on paper and scanned into the computer  for coloring.\nAs you can see, a lot of work goes into each completed scene, SO...\nWith your help I can have a proper studio and equipment for the second half of the film.\nI joke that if ever there was a cartoon shot \"on location\" it was The Circus.  The first few scenes were done during evenings and weekends in a rented room in Burbank.  The dance scene was animated in the apartment where I did my work for Last Days of Coney Island, then inked and colored in a second temporary location.  The burger scene was done at my mother's house in North Carolina.  The hat scene was done on someone's couch.  This is no way to live... I need a studio!\nBudget Breakdown\nHere is a rough breakdown of where your pledges will be going.\nRENT FOR A STUDIO\nPROPER EQUIPMENT\nSUPPLIES\nPROFESSIONAL AUDIO\nPAY THE FOLKS WHO HELPED ME\nDELIVERING PRIZES AND REWARDS\nKICKSTARTER AND AMAZON PAYMENTS TAKE A PERCENTAGE\nLooking Ahead\nHere's a look at some plans for an upcoming scene:\nA Camel Gets Into Some Shandy\n With your help I can make it happen!\n-Elana\nA special thank you to Nick Remes for his wonderful help with the video.\n*****Exciting Update!

Not exactly what I was looking for to be taken seriously as a technology executive.\nOn the other hand, though, the sleek, modern notebooks I found lacked all functionality and served only as appointment books or calendars. They were simply a collection of the same lined pages over and over again, leaving me no system for differentiating meeting notes from 1:1 sessions, product research from yearly goals.\nThe search for the perfect, professional notebook left me wondering: Why is it so hard to find a notebook with tons of functionality and a beautiful, professional design? I wrote a blog post (https://popforms.com/notebooks-fall-short/) about my struggle to find the perfect notebook, and the response was overwhelming. I had hit a nerve.\nAnd so I decided to stop searching and starting building it: the perfect notebook.\nShare this project on Facebook!\nShare this project on Twitter! \nHelp share the project on social media, and we'll send you a bundle of the very best pages from the notebook for free!

That\u2019s why I worked with a very talented designer (who has designed several planners) and super smart product people to create a tremendously comprehensive organization and planning system within a beautifully-designed, professional-looking notebook.\nOver the past 6-8 months, we have been road-testing prototypes. We have gone through almost 100 iterations on the page layouts, types of pages, and order of the pages to settle on a design we know will make you more successful.\nI myself purchased nearly 50 different types of notebooks, and, after testing all of them, I settled on the elements that I thought made for a perfect notebook: a cover and material that looks great, feels great, and will hold up to be thrown in your bag all day long. (And it comes in classic black since that goes with everything.) \nWe also tested many types of paper and found a gorgeous option that won\u2019t bleed through \u2014 so the paper feels great and you can actually write on both sides of the page.  \nAnd we looked at different binding and picked one that lays flat so it is comfortable to write on both sides of the page.\nThe printer we chose to produce the notebook has produced all kinds of great notebooks and planners, so they are able to help us create a high quality, yet still affordable, notebook.\nIn addition to a high quality look and feel, we\u2019ve also made sure our content is top-notch too. We have road-tested each and every one of the layouts in The Spark Notebook. \nTop executives in big-name companies, startup CEOs, venture capitalists, authors, artists, designers, engineers, administrative assistants, and many more have taken our prototypes for a test drive. This diverse group of people gave us so much great feedback, and we\u2019ve incorporated it all into The Spark Notebook to create the most user-friendly experience possible.\nYou can even download a sample of our layouts to test-drive them yourself for free, just by sharing this project on social media. (Read below for more details!)\nSHARE US AND GET OUR BEST PAGES FOR FREE!\nI love this notebook and truly believe the tools we\u2019ve created within it will add value to anyone\u2014and I want you to have access to all of that value, whether you donate to the project or not.\nAnd so, we have created a downloadable PDF of our favorite and most useful layouts that you can get completely for free. \nAll you have to do is share our project on social media, and then send us a note at sparknotebook@popforms.com with a screenshot or a link of where you shared it, we will send you a PDF with:\nMonthly Goals\nWeekly Outlook \nProject Planner \n30-Day Challenge\nThis notebook is amazing, and I truly believe the tools inside it will help you be more successful. Which is why I want to share these pages for free.\nI want you to have all the benefits I\u2019ve worked so hard to create in this notebook, regardless of whether you are able to contribute to the project.

The biggest risk, then, is that your notebook might be late. Problems may come up (they always do\u2026) in the production process, but the folks I am working with have a history of producing quality products on time. After all, printing notebooks is their job.\n\nI guarantee you will get your notebooks, and I will do everything in my power (up to and including hopping on a plane and heading to the printer myself) to get yours to you on time so you can start using them as soon as possible.\n\nIf problems do come up or you aren\u2019t happy with your notebook, I promise to do everything I can to make it right. I want you to love your notebook, and if you don\u2019t, I want to fix that.\n\nI am committed to being transparent and open during this whole process.

She prefers to keep her past shrouded in as much mystery as possible, but the crew has managed to learn enough about her character to trust her with their lives. She\u2019s had the Galaxy Girl since she was 17, and has heavily modified it over the years to fit her specific needs.\nTanna Galaxy (27 yrs old) - Mal's twin sister (not identical) has always been known as the serious sister. Her no-nonsense attitude keeps the group together, while her strategic leadership keeps them alive. She leaves the crew to join the Galactic Union's elite police force - abandoning her sister and the crew in favor of a payday and job security. \nVernita (125 yrs old) - The bird-like women of Tarath are the largest and most powerful members of the Independent movement. Vernita protested the planet's race to join the war between the Union and Independents. She was sent into exile for refusing to join the fight against universal government proposed by the Union's formation.\nDahlia (Unknown) - One, in a line of PleasureDrones - Sex-bots that had the unique ability to change their appearance based on pre-programmed DataPacks. Quickly recalled by their manufacturer after hackers began to make them look like celebrities and political figures. Dahlia managed to escape the recall and has been hiding as a part of Mal\u2019s crew ever since.\nDr. Dot (15 yrs old) - She is a female Doogie Howser. She joined the Galaxy Girl crew after completing med school and finding the Intergalactic Medical System to be corrupt. Dot has a huge collection of make-up that she covets and refuses to share with her shipmates.  She also kind of has a crush on Mal...\nHOW WILL THE MONEY BE SPENT?\nGreat question. It's simple: the money being raised will pay the artist for his talent and time. This is a passion project for me. I've spent the last seven years thinking, developing and writing Galaxy Girls. The commitment to write it isn't as time intensive as the commitment to draw the whole thing. That is where your investment into our dream comes into play. \nTypically an artist of Sherard's caliber makes anywhere from $90 - $200 a page (if not more in some cases, especially considering he's also coloring), and this money is how he supports himself. \nI'm asking Sherard to draw over 100 pages. It will take him a few months of dedicated work to produce the book in a timely manner. Therefore he needs, and deserves, to be compensated. \nThe $11,000 we are asking for breaks down like this:\n-$1100.00 - Kickstarter Fees\nLeaving us with $9900.00 of which we'll pay Sherard...\n$88.00 per page for 113 pages of digital comic book awesome. \nI believe in this project, and I want the best possible artist, I found that person in Sherard. Now I need to pay him to block out the time to get this thing drawn. I'm hoping your pre-orders can help make that a reality.\nReward costs will come out of my pocket. It's worth it for me to get T-shirts, stickers and pins made for those of you who are gracious enough to contribute to making this dream of mine a reality. You're already the coolest people in the world just for taking the time to read this plea. \nAs I've mentioned, this is a DIGITAL release. The money we're hoping to raise, sadly, doesn't cover any printing costs. SO... We're also (as mentioned below) launching with built in stretch goals so that you can have a transparent understanding of what we're asking for, what we want and why...\n*STRETCH GOAL 1 - If we hit $15,000 everyone who donated at $25 or above will receive a BOUND, PRINTED VERSION of the book!!  \n*STRETCH GOAL 2 - If we hit $25,000 all SOFT COVERS are upgraded to a HARDCOVER version of the book!!\nT-SHIRT CHOICES \nDepending on what amount you donate, you could find yourself eligible for a T-shirt as a reward. The choices of T-shirts are below. Each shirt is an original design by Sherard Jackson, and three are featured in the book at some point or another. \nABOUT THE CREATORS\nSherard Jackson and Shawn DePasquale have worked in the comics industry for well over a decade. \nShawn DePasquale is a Los Angeles based television, movie and comic book writer. His previous graphic novels SPACE, MN and PIXIES, were critically acclaimed, and are now drawing motion picture interest from a major production company. Shawn is a jack-of-all-trades in the comic book industry, having lettered work for Image, Oni, Archaia, Zenescope and more since 2003. \nSherard Jackson is a comic book artist, animator and writer whose work has been published by DC online, Image Comics, BOOM! Studios, Marvel, Antarctic Press, Devil\u2019s Due Publishing, Dynamite Entertainment, and Big Head Press. He is currently working on more creator-owned projects including a follow up to his highly-regarded Image book Semantic Lace. The Galaxy Girls represents an exciting new evolution in his gorgeous style.\nQUICK THANKS\nThe above video would not have been possible without the help of filmmaker Rebecca Shapiro who had to sit in a room with Sherard and I while we figured out what to say, then made us look way better than we appear in real life.  Contact her for your own kickstarter video at https://twitter.com/byrshapiro.\nThe music was written and provided by Dan Teicher - composer, musician, rock god - who can be found at http://www.danteicher.com/ and also on-stage with The Ludlow Thieves - an immensely talented band who, if you're not already familar with, you should be. Check'em out! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe nice thing about this project is that the risks are minimal. Part of the reasoning behind an all-digital release is that we won't have a printing cost overhead, which means our fundraising goal is lower. This is also the reasoning behind the stretch goals, which we'll repeat below:\n\n*STRETCH GOAL 1 - If we hit $15,000 everyone who donated at $25 or above will receive a BOUND, PRINTED VERSION of the book!! \n\n*STRETCH GOAL 2 - If we hit $25,000 all SOFT COVERS are upgraded to a HARDCOVER version of the book!!\n\nWe did the math and realized that if we go over our initial goal by $4,000 we can afford to include a printed version of the book!! We then looked into the jump to print hardcover and realized it's a bit more expensive, hence the jump to a $25,000 stretch goal. \n\nThe only other potential snag might be the fulfillment of the sketches, which can take a while. However we have a solid plan in place for getting the book finished first and then having Sherard move on to donor sketches.\n\nIn closing both Sherard and I want to thank you for taking the time to read the above, check out the page and spreading the word even if you can't afford a donation. That said, we also want to express that every little bit helps, even a dollar can brings us closer to our goal and get this story and these characters out into the world. We love them and we know you will too.

The game began by trying to represent a continuously changing city that adapts and morphs to each unique user. The design of the city has been in our minds since we were children; a city that is fantastical with a cyberpunk edge. We want it be as sublime as possible, mixing nostalgic suburban landscapes with futuristic urban boroughs.\nThe city is situated on an inverted sphere, providing an endless playing field without the traditional environmental tropes that stall one\u2019s exploration. Traditional mapping is impossible as the city is always reforming, the only way to unlock the secrets of the city is start an adventure and explore.\nCity + Location\nCities change every day. In HomeMake the environment will constantly change at an unnoticeable rate.  The concept of progression works on multiple scales. The overall scope of the game is one of progression, as the player evolves their understanding of the world and narrative, the city morphs and adapts, creating an ever changing cityscape. The totality of the system is never fully understood as a constant state of progression is maintained.The game will be set in Galaxy SEED (Stellar Earth Evolution Designer) Sumimoto. The main character lives on the inside of Sumimoto in the suburbs of the city sprawled around the inner surface. An inverted planet, the player travels along the interior surface of the sphere, providing a continuous playing field with no obvious boundaries.\nThe existence of the urban fabric as an inverted planet creates a variety of unique moments. Although the city development and types of spaces vary widely throughout, the constant factor acting on all structures is the gravity. Radiating from the center, buildings must thrust inward. Available air volume decreases as buildings grow. Negotiations and tensions arise and create architectural problems as buildings begin to bump into each other. The nature of the street, and the views of the city above are in constant dialogue with the battle happening between buildings as they clash in the sky.\nThe complexity of the views coupled with the sublime understanding of motion and relativity caused by the centralized gravity results in challenging platforming elements as players travel across the city hunting new goals.\nCity + Identity\nOur desires to explore such a city lead to the mind transfer game mechanic. We wanted to understand what it felt like to inhabit our city but not just from our own point of view. Every resident of a city has a unique take on the environment, with their own personal biases and experiences coloring their understanding, a wholly unique version of the same city lives inside everyone\u2019s heads. In exploring our city, we often found ourselves changing our characters attributes to gain a different perspective of our city through a new method of interaction. We want our game to explore these subjective understandings of space and how they related to the individual character.\nAs a result, Sumimoto is littered with multiple avatars, each with distinctive abilities, desires and biases. This causes multiple body swaps as one traverses the shifting cityscape. This piqued our imagination as we began to speculate on the possibility of multiple perspectives; our city is experienced a lot differently between different avatars. Playing as either a robot, a plant, or a hippo, not only will the city change to match your characters unique abilities, but perceptually the city will be represented in a new way, reflecting each character\u2019s take on the environment.\nCity + Desire\nGameplay revolves around perceptual based puzzles that require body swapping to unlock the secrets of the city. Different bodies provide different platforming advantages. Some run faster. Some see sound. Some talk smooth. The changing urban fabric encourages the player to swap bodies in order to address the immediate landscape around them.\nRegarding to the platforming elements, the constant changing of the city creates an ever expanding series of challenges that arise as geometry shifts and varies. It is at the player\u2019s own discretion that they determine the best character and exploration technique required to advance through the city.\n City + Sound\nOur music making experience is rooted in DJing. We want to add this experience of nonstop DJ mixing to the game, providing a continuous soundtrack to compliment the endless environment. As indicated by our opting for an essential mixtape, there will be no set OST for the game, instead different musical parts will blend into an endless tapestry based on environment and gameplay. The musical pieces move through genre from blues to jazz to funk to hip-hop to glitch, creating a hybrid sense of nostalgia and future.\n  The Duo\nFranklin Cosgrove (Cory) + Archgame (Matt) are architecture students by day and video game designers by night. The city in our game has been building in our minds since we were children in the Midwest, where vast urban fields are still fantasy. Franklin Cosgrove is a comic aficionado and animator, likely found at your local comic book shop every Wednesday. Archgame is a computer programmer and DJ, still preferring analog vinyl control when mixing his music digitally. \nAs architecture students, our two man team has extensive experience designing environments and 3D modeling.Our architecture has always been influenced by our experience in the digital environments of video games, now we\u2019d like to reverse this and create a video game that draws on our experience as architects.\nKigi\nKigi is our main robot. Gameplay wise, although he can\u2019t jump very high, he can run fast, see sound, and shoot light. An excellent skill to have when trying to navigate those congested city streets or when you\u2019re in some trouble with the local bullies. He hasn\u2019t always been so functional, however, and your first objective in HomeMake is to sneak out of the house, find all Kigi\u2019s missing parts and piece him together.\nSandwiches\nAllow us to introduce Sandwiches the fox. That's right. Sandwiches. Unlike Kigi, Sandwiches, is our most recent addition to the HomeMake cast. The idea came to us when thinking about a character who had to somehow navigate the city using a different sense other than vision. Unfortunately for poor Sandwiches, he is completely color blind, unable to enjoy the poly chromatic city around him. He doesn't seem to mind though as he has a keen sense of smell and a quick pace to make up for it.\n\nIso\nNext, we wanted to introduce you to another one of the main characters, Iso. For the most part, Iso is just a normal kid. You're already seen his pet fox, Sandwiches, and his robotic friend Kigi. Generally speaking, Iso is quite limited in his methods of exploration. He can't run too fast, he's not the best climber, and will therefore have to rely on the abilities of those close to him. Where he excels, however, is in his ability to talk his way out of problems. If you ever need choice information from the inhabitants of Sumimoto, Iso knows how to get it.\nHabo\nThe next character we'd like to introduce is Habo. We show this guy a little bit in the trailer but he is a hint at some of the more dangerous aspects of the city. All places have those spots you don't really want to be at a certain time of day and Sumimoto is no different. He may be a boss but who knows, maybe you'll get to know him first.

We are more excited than ever about HomeMake's design and encourage everyone to continue sharing this project with as many people as possible.  \nWe disagree with the idea that there's direct correlation between quality and scope in a project like this. Our original funding goal was the bare minimum and maximum we needed to complete the game as we originally designed it. Recently we've seen a lot of games go beyond their original scope and end up spreading themselves too thin. We have no desire to make the same mistake.\n However, platform/console development does require additional resources outside of the game's original design. The more money we have, the better we can invest ourselves into working on HomeMake unencumbered and release the game to as many platforms/consoles as possible. We are artists first and foremost, so for us it is more important to get HomeMake into as many people's hands as possible over financial success. Currently we hope to release HomeMake on PS3, PS4, Wii, WiiU, and Xbox One, with Sega Dreamcast as a bonus. All extra funds will be put towards as wide a distribution as manageable. We know this seems ambitious, and therefore, we encourage everyone to continue sharing the game and supporting it. This way, we can share HomeMake with as many people as possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith no previously published games, we understand we play the underdogs in this story. As architecture students, we have the ability to forego sleep and food to complete projects and meet deadlines but unfortunately pure willpower can only get us so far.

We are excited to continue honing what we already have and create even more content to give each player a multi-layered environment to explore, but in order to do this, we need your support!\n\nLimited software licenses and old computers have allowed us to bring the game to its current level.

The first of its kind, this completely original pop up book includes 16 architecturally accurate pop ups, profiles of each of the five historic weathervanes along the trail and written history about landmarks like The U.S.S. Constitution and the Old South Meeting House.\nThe time has come to print and publish the book and this is where I need your help!\nI plan on self-publishing the book and distributing it through boutiques, bookstores, and gift shops along the trail and throughout Massachusetts.

Constitution - Charlestown, MA\nThe Backstory of Boston's First Pop Up Book \nA little over four years ago I traveled to Boston and was excited to walk The Freedom Trail\u00ae for the first time.  I became fascinated with Boston\u2019s history, beauty, and the dedication the city has shown in preserving its monuments and landmarks.  Toward the end of my trip I searched for a Freedom Trail\u00ae pop up book to bring home to add to my collection of souvenir pop up books.  When I couldn\u2019t find one, I searched for any Boston pop up book.  To my disappointment I found that there were no popup books about Boston at all (only one of Fenway Park, out of print)! So I began to create one.\nWith encouragement from The Freedom Trail\u00ae Foundation and permission to use their medallion and trademark, I developed a succinct written history about the trail and its landmarks and created full color illustrations and architecturally accurate pop ups. The book is truly a one of a kind memento perfect for history lovers, educators, art enthusiasts, and of course, children.\nMassachusetts State House - Boston, MA\nWhat's in the book?\nThere are 16 pop ups in the book as well as a selection of movable pieces and full color illustrations. All painstakingly detailed to echo the architectural splendor of the historically significant buildings of Boston.\nThey include:\nDetail pop ups of a full color rendering of The Freedom Trail\u00ae Foundation Medallion and the Frog Pond building on Boston Common\nFully three dimensional, two page pop ups of The Massachusetts State House, Old State House, U.S.S. Constitution, King's Chapel, Old North Church steeple and Faneuil Hall\nOld Corner Bookstore Illustration with moveable sign 1717 to 1826\nA pop up of my artistic interpretation of Paul Revere's [actually Henry Pelam's] etching of the Boston Massacre \nAnd more!\nWhat's Next?\nIf I am funded, I will be able to obtain the final color dummy book from the assembly house. After any edits are completed, the book will go to press. Once printed, the book will be hand assembled, piece by piece, and glued together. When the inside is complete, it will be mounted into the hard cover binding, boxed and shipped to Boston. Then, after the Kickstarter Rewards are sent I will work to distribute and promote the book. With the help of The Freedom Trail\u00ae Foundation, their five approved stores for merchandise purchase, the famous Cheers Bar & Restaurant and other local shops that express interest in carrying the book for sale The Freedom Trail\u00ae Pop Up book will be available to the public. \nFaneuil Hall - Boston, MA\n We have had some requests to see the weathervane card.

They are all hand produced and assembled and are considered risky investments by traditional publishers at such a small run and limited geographic scope.

(see Stretch Goals section, below)\nWho or what is Tank Girl?\nTank Girl is a creator-owned comic book series about an Australian outlaw anti-heroine and her friends. The series began in 1988 when Tank Girl appeared in the first issue of Deadline Magazine in the UK. Since then she has starred in her own comics, magazines, a novel, and even her own Hollywood movie (Tank Girl, 1995, starring Lori Petty, Naomi Watts, Ice-T, and Malcolm McDowell).\nTank Girl and Booga by project artist Brett Parson\n  I'm Alan, writer of the series, I co-created the character with artist/director Jamie Hewlett. Jamie is now properly world famous as being one half of the team behind the virtual band Gorillaz.\nThis is my project.\nThe goal is to create a brand-spanking-new, 100 page, hardback Tank Girl book. It will feature artwork from seven different artists (some Tank Girl veterans and some new chaps), and will be written, edited, and designed by me. \n This will be a truly independent venture, side-stepping the publishing industry and distribution networks, to deliver a product straight into your hands, direct from the creators.\nThe confirmed artists on this project are - Jamie Hewlett, Brett Parson, Warwick Johnson-Cadwell, Philip Bond, Jim Mahfood, Craig Knowles, and Jonathan Edwards.\nThe book will feature two different cover designs, both drawn by Jamie Hewlett - one on the hardcover (case), and one on a wrap-around dust jacket. The latter cover will only be available through this Kickstarter, this will be your one and only chance to buy the book in this form, when the Kickstarter is over, the dust jacket comes off!\n The book will be crammed full with a chaotic mix of short comic strips, poster pages, poems, longer strips, an illustrated text story, and much more. \nYou'll discover what Tank Girl's real name is in the story \"The Name of Tank Girl\" (clue - it's not Rebecca Buck)\nYou'll learn tactical tank manoeuvres and vital post-apocalyptic survival techniques.\nYou'll see Tank Girl explore new worlds in her slightly phallic rocket ship.\nAnd you'll finally find out what Tank Girl keeps covered up with that Band-Aid.\nThe book will be A4 sized (297mm x 210mm), a much larger format than the standard American graphic novel, to better display the fabulous artwork from our crack team of artists.\nI'm totally over-excited about the line-up of artists: Jamie hasn't drawn a comic for more than 15 years, and hasn't drawn a Tank Girl strip since 1996! Readers of the original run of comics will recognise the name of Philip Bond, who worked on Tank Girl with us back in the Deadline days, and has gone on to be a regular artist for DC Vertigo. Two recent Tank Girl artists, Jim Mahfood and Warwick Johnson-Cadwell, will return to inject TG with their diverse and radical stylings, and brilliant Brit illustrator Jonathan Edwards will finally get a turn at drawing TG, after originally being slated as artist back in 1996, only to see the Tank Girl publishing empire collapse before he had a chance. The list is topped off with two excellent artists, both new to Tank Girl, who have been setting my blog and the Tank Girl Facebook page ablaze with their incredible artwork - Craig Knowles and Brett Parson (aka Blitzcadet).\nTank Girl by project artist Philip Bond\nWhat is a Kickstarter?\nFor thirty days, you'll be able to make pledges to help make this project happen, ranging from \u00a31 up to \u00a35,000. \nBut we're not just asking you to \"donate\" your hard-earned cash because we think that we are worthy cause, oh no, we're offering top value-for-money rewards in return for every pledge made.\nFor your pledge, you can select one of the reward packages\u2014listed to the right\u2014of equal or lesser value to your pledge. You can always pledge more than the minimum required to get a reward if you're feeling generous. Your credit card or other account will not actually be charged at the time you make your pledge, and you can change your mind right up to the final deadline.\nIf the end of the Kickstarter comes and we've reached our goal, then you all get charged the amount you pledged, and we will get on with writing, drawing, printing, posting, shouting, crying etc. But if we don't meet our goal, then the whole thing is called off. No one gets charged, no fees are applied, everyone keeps their money, and we all go home with no book.\nWhat do I get?\nTake a look on the right hand side of this page and you'll see a list of different pledge amounts. Under each amount is a description of the rewards you'll get for that level. \nMost of the levels include either the 21st Century Tank Girl book itself, a smaller comic-style \"sampler\" of the book (which will have a sampling of content from the book plus some stuff that isn't in the book), or both. These will be shipped when we have finished the artwork and printed the books. We will be using a UK printer, which, while a little more expensive, cuts out the shipping delay that we would get if we printed in the Far East.\nDomestic shipping within the UK is included in the price of all reward levels. Some of the shipping costs outside the UK will be absorbed by the pledge level price, but a bit extra is usually required to cover the full expense (worldwide shipping costs are stated at the bottom of each level description).\nThere's a whole bunch of premium rewards for those of you who really want to step it up, including pieces of original artwork, bespoke text novels, posters, bags of booty, a chance to get killed by Tank Girl in one of the stories, a years worth of gifts and letters, and a book with penises drawn all over it - the perfect gift for the one you love.\nTank Girl by project artist Jim Mahfood\nOver-funding and stretch goals\nIf we're lucky enough to reach our goal and go past it, we've got a lot of plans that we can bring into action. Firstly adding a bit of spit and polish to the book - some spot-varnish, embossing the cover, full-colour end-papers etc. If we exceed that goal, we will hand out some very funny (and a rather naughty) surprise bonus gifts. If we make more than that, we will look into putting funds towards the production of the next-next Tank Girl book!\nWhat will we spend the money on?\nOur goal is a big ask, but every penny is accounted for - paying for artwork, lettering, script, printing the books, shipping the books, manufacturing the rewards, handling, packaging, postage, and paying a percentage to Kickstarter and the taxman.\nAdd-Ons - If you fancy a little extra something...\n(please note - Add-Ons are only available with the \u00a323 Book level and higher. No Add-Ons with any Pledge Levels below \u00a323 please!)\nHere\u2019s how Add-Ons work - Choose a pledge level from the list on the right, then select any extra items you want to add to your reward from the list below. Follow the payment process until you are asked how much you would like to pay, then simply add the price of your extras onto the price of your pledge level, and that is your total.

Recently I created a list of 15 dream projects I would like to design and make ranging from a kids pop-up book, to a board game to an 18 hole miniature golf course. One of these projects I thought I could knock off pretty easy to get the ball rolling on my designers bucket list was a set of artisan Halloween masks. What could be more fun than design a set of whimsically weird Halloween masks.  From this Kooky Creeps was hatched. I'd appreciate your support to help me knock-dead this first project on my list.\nKooky Creeps come in a large flat coffin portfollio, signed by the artist and in a hand numbered limited edition of 1000. This is just a mock up, final design may vary.\nWhy Paper?\nPaper is humble, versatile, easy to source and after the fun is all done it is recyclable! I can source and produce these locally. No need to ship over seas from a factory. Not only proudly made in the USA but proudly made just down the street! I love making papercraft projects like this because it creates a collaboration between me and you. This isn't something you buy and put on a shelf your participation is necessary to bring my creations to life and in this case they really come to life when you wear them. \nThe root of all evil!\nMy goal for this project is $6000 this will be enough to help me produce my first run of Kooky Creeps and provide some fun incentives to you the backers.
