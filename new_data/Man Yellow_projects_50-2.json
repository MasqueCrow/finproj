[{"backer": "Man Yellow", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Is your bookshelf a mess? Do you own so many games they\u2019ve become a hazard? Are your dungeon crawls a disorganized disaster? We were like that, too \u2013 so we came up with a solution!\nThis Kickstarter funds a custom-printed shelf file designed for holding adventure modules, hardcover RPG books, and boxed sets. All four exterior panels feature new hand-painted art by Doug Kovacs!\nThe shelf file has a 3\u201d wide spine. This is thick enough to fit two big hardbacks, about 25 \u201cskinny modules,\u201d or one to two RPG boxed sets. It also fits board games that are in letter-sized dimensions. It comes with preprinted spine labels you can use to identify the contents.\nWe're offering backers of this Kickstarter a special pre-distribution price. When offered through distribution at a later date, we anticipate these costing $5 more.\nWith enough support, our stretch goals will give away extra shelf files to backers for free!\nWe're also offering a great price on a big collection of randomly selected adventure modules for your new shelf file!\nAnd backers will get to vote on the final name of the product!\nThe Sturdy Shelf File\nMade of durable corrugated cardboard, the shelf file is die-cut to shape. It ships flat, and easily folds into position. Each box is individually polybagged for safety in shipping.\nThe shelf file of holding, ready for your adventure modules!\nAmazing Art\nDoug Kovacs has hand-painted brand new art specially designed just for this project. He sketched out the image on a physical sample and painted it to fit. It will look so good, you\u2019ll want to leave this shelf file out in the open!\nSpine Labels\nEach shelf file comes with a page of labels. You can use these to easily identify what\u2019s in the box. \nStretch Goals through Economies of Scale\nWe're already level 1! That means bonus shelf files!Read this update for details! Now, help us get to 6th level!\nThe printing for this project is a classic example of economies of scale. We need to produce a die-cut mold and cover a number of up-front costs. The more we print, the faster we hurdle those fixed costs, and the lower the unit cost becomes. Stretch goals are therefore based on backers getting more copies for the same price they already pledged. \nThe basic pledge levels cover 1, 2, or 3 shelf files, and those pledge levels don\u2019t receive stretch goals. If you pledge for 4, 6, 8, or 10 shelf files, those pledge levels will begin to receive extra copies if we hit certain milestones. The end result looks kind of like a class progression table. If you've played D&D you know what we mean! It works like this:\nFor example: if the project hits 4,000 shelf files sold, everyone who pledged for 4 shelf files will actually get 5; everyone who pledged for 6 will actually get 7; and so on.\nAbove 6,000 copies, the incremental unit costs don\u2019t reduce appreciably. There are no more extra levels above there. (Unless we hit some crazy amount - never say never!)\nNote that the bonus shelf files don\u2019t \u201ccount double\u201d \u2013 only the core pledged copies count toward the stretch goal math.\n Fill It With Adventures! \nBuy your shelf file pre-filled with adventure modules at a great price! \nFor $75, you can add on a stack of 20 randomly selected adventures from our extensive line. You will save at least $125 price against cover price. There will be no duplication among the adventures, which will come from our Dungeon Crawl Classics, Mutant Crawl Classics, Fifth Edition Fantasy, Dungeon Crawl Classics Lankhmar, and other product lines.\nDepending on the mix of adventures in your random pull, you may save even more than $125. Most of our adventure modules are priced at $10, but some limited-edition variants have an MSRP of $15 or more. Those options will be included in the random pull, so depending on the mix of titles you receive, you may get an even better deal for the $75 add-on price.\nEach shelf file holds about 25 adventure modules! Stuff it full with a random pull!\nWhat To Name This Thing?\nWe asked our fans what to name this thing, and we had so many great suggestions! So many, in fact, that we could not decide.\nEvery day we will change the name of this project to a prospective name. Over the course of the project you will see two dozen possible names!\nOnce the project ends, all backers will be given a chance to vote.\nMay the best name win!\nShipping Costs\nBased on the advance prototype, we can estimate shipping costs as follows. Please note that these are estimates. Final costs will be determined at time of shipping based on weight of the physical goods. These shipping costs are for the shelf file only and do not include the pack of randomly selected adventures. That pack will add approximately $10-$15 in additional shipping cost in the USA and substantially more for international orders. International shipping costs below include prepaid VAT and shipping via a very efficient FedEx program with prefilled customs forms and quick turnaround. US shipping is estimated via priority mail.\n1 shelf file: $10-12 USA; $18-$20 international\n2-3 shelf files: $12-13 USA; $25-$30 international\n4-6 shelf files: $14-16 USA; $35-$45 international\n8-10 shelf files: $17-18 USA; $50-$80 international\nTidy up your bookshelf with the Shelf File of Holding!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run more than twenty Kickstarters, all fulfilled successfully or on track to do so.

These tiny beasts with magical spirits are now able to adventure side-by-side with the other races, equally! This book contains everything you need to play D&D as a former familiar.\nAll the familiar species are included and balanced for exciting gameplay. Thirteen animal races from the Find Familiar spell are available to you and each has three distinct sub-races. That is nearly 40 animals you can choose from!\n Your familiar can choose from 6 classes, each of which leans heavily upon one of the six abilities. Within each class are three sub-classes. These draw from the three aspects of every familiar: their physical form, their arcane past, and their spirit type (Celestial, Fey, or Fiend). The book also contains rule options for those who want to play existing classes.\n Wizards rely on their familiars in different ways. UnFamiliar offers 13 distinctly different backgrounds to reflect your past experience. As part of the balancing with the standard races, each background includes a new cantrip you can cast. This cantrip was not only helpful for your previous life as a familiar but will be useful for adventuring, too.\nFamiliars have one of three spirit types: Celestial, Fey, or Fiend. Your spirit provides additional thematic flavor to your character and also gives you abilities that help balance the UnFamiliar races with the standard races.\nSeveral new feats are available to UnFamiliar characters which reflect their animal nature. A few races even gain a feat at first level to compensate for lacking other traits. Albino, Potent Poison, and Nervous Anticipation are just a few of the feats that will make your character even more unique!\nThrough the spell that liberates a familiar, it gains the ability to speak. This may be shocking to some folks you come across, but when you see an animal walk up to you wearing clothes, hearing them talk isn't exactly mind blowing. However, people will definitely be curious about you!\nEvery reward level includes the complete set of UnFamiliar character token markers for use in Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds. Easy to use and integrate into your games.\n.\nAdd-Ons\nTraveling Encounters: Volume 1 is a 5-star rated book full of creative low-level encounters. Each encounter contains unexpected twists and utilizes skill proficiencies that often get ignored. Each encounter is adjustable for parties from 1st to 5th level. Add-ons available in hardcover and pdf.\nCall to Adventure contains over 30 new character backgrounds for D&D complete with unique personality traits, new background-related spells, and useful background features. Add-ons available in hardcover and pdf.\nShipping: \nThe cost of shipping is already calculated. The cost to ship a single book (hardcover or softcover) is $6US for the United States, $9US for Canada, EU, and UK, and $16US for all other nations.\nDogs have been unlocked and are being added to the book! Thanks to everyone who made it happen!\nIf we get to the unlikely goal of 2000 backers, the book will become longer with the addition of a 7th class, similar to the Artificer.\n\n.\nJerry Joe Seltzer, writer and illustrator\nJerry teaches art to students online through Outschool and other platforms.

One's more magic-heavy and one's more tech-heavy. They're both packed with player options, gazetteers, new mechanics, monsters, and adventures that are rad as hell.\nListen to our interviews with Pod of Blunders here, and 307 RPG here! \nWe'd like for you to be a part of it! Sound like your cup of joe? Then let's roll out....\nThe city of Morlock's Mount in Tidetimber.\nWelcome to Comets & Cockpits. \nWe're gonna bring to life the junker space genre long missing from 5e - a genre that we believe many tables are ravenous for. \nWhether your party chooses to become rough and tumble scrappers on Adelphos, or decide to hunt down runes to power railguns in Epoch, you're going to have an absolute blast while yo do it!\nA note on the content: If you haven't noticed by now, our approach to this material is to primarily infuse it with excitement and energy. Everything else follows behind those two focal points. Look elsewhere all ye who desire archaic language and dour premise. \nWhat is the scope of the Kickstarter?\nThe project is divided into (2) hardcover books, each with their own attitude. \n Geographica Adelphos: Set on a massive, unexplored world filled with ancient artifacts and locations,  Adelphos presents a grittier/grungier atmosphere. \n Technologica Epoch: Filled with magitech, mechs, and starships, Epoch is set in a thriving satellite city with corporate espionage galore. \nBoth projects will be built through this Kickstarter and published on DriveThruRPG for PDF or print-on-demand purchase. \nClick to Download File\nLayout by David Barrentine\nWithin Geographica Adelphos, we're drawing upon the exploratory and swashbuckling qualities of space fantasy; so whether you are an odontos salvager from Runesalt fending off simbast poachers, or a vault delver in the old cargo tunnels within the limestone cliffs of Black Bay attempting to allude a hologhost - Adelphos has plenty to whet your whistle.\nThis book includes:\nA detailed setting guide to the world of Adelphos.\n 5 new races and new trait options for all base 5e races. \n 7 new subclasses, 7 new backgrounds, 10 new spells, 10 new feats, and a bunch of original gear.\nRules for new magic systems based on spark, sigils, and runestones.\nA gazetteer filled with specific guilds, exploration mechanics, and more.\n Runesalt Salvagers: a 6th-level adventure.\nA 30+ creature bestiary filled with beasts, monsters, dragons, and kaiju!\nWith a flavor like Firefly and Borderlands (with a runic twist), Geographica Adelphos offers a boots-on-the-ground setting where homesteaders will fight against all odds to win a planet they thought long lost.\nA ship docked near a Haven waypost.\nLayout by David Barrentine\nIn Technologica Epoch, we are focusing more on the potential technology and how it works with magic - all in the ancient satellite city of Epoch  - powered by the spirit of a long dead creator being. Epoch is a leftover remnant of the construction of the universe, a massive mechanical marvel that has now become accessible finally to explorers as it sat in the stars above Adelphos. \nThis book includes:\nA detailed setting guide to the satellite city of Epoch.\n 5 new races and new trait options for all base 5e races. \n 7 new subclasses, 10 new backgrounds, magitech enhancements, magic items, feats, and a bunch of original gear.\nRules for new mech and startship mechanics.\nA gazetteer filled with specific factions, space stations, corporations and more.\n D-ARK: a 8th-level adventure, and A Reasonable Amount of Trouble: a 1st-4th level adventure. \nA 20+ creature bestiary filled with constructs, elementals, humanoids, and exarchs!\nThe book dives into the construction of space stations, mechs, ships, and other technologies, as well as ship and mech combat, and a whole bevy of other mechanized magnificence. Book Two will be for those who enjoy Destiny, Gundam, Halo, and Star Wars - all action and all tech.\nStarships battling a kaiju.\nQ&A Basics\nWhat is \"junker space fantasy\"?\nThe genre of junker space fantasy is one that can cover a wide gamut of themes, but at its core, it consists of three key things: swashbuckling adventure, wide open exploration and salvaging, and wild technology. If you know WildStar, Firefly, or Borderlands, you know the genre. \nWhat makes us different from other 5e sci-fi?\nWe're not throwing the baby out with the bath water.  Traditional fantasy mechanics and flavor will sit right alongside our magitech elements, creating a vibrant medley of options. \nWanna play a Circle of the Moon Druid and still feel relevant? You can do that.\nWant to use that sweet scimitar of speed your grandfather handed down to you? You can do that.\nWanna be a druid wielding a scimitar of speed while flying a speeder against a rampaging mech? Now you can do that!\nWhat are some details about the setting?\nIn the beginning, there was nothing - and then appeared the Exarchs of Singularity. They scattered to conquer, lead, and create other worlds, while their leader Opus Nyn made the Kyldur System and within it the megaplanet of Adelphos. When their work on Adelphos was done, Nyn transformed the ship of the Exarchs into a great satellite city and became its soul engine, naming the satellite Epoch. \nMany millennia passed and great cataclysms shattered Adelphos, casting her native peoples across the stars. In time, those same peoples would rediscover the Kyldur System. Adelphos and Epoch represent nature and technology, magic and science, chaos and organization. \nAs adventurers in Comets & Cockpits, you'll be exploring both of these locations. Characters can be made from the new options available in both books, or you can use a traditional fantasy build for some of that good Spelljammer flavor. Both books are jam-packed with toolkits that make running a 5e game with sci-fi tones an absolute breeze.\nLet's break down what each of the rewards looks like in greater detail.

Anime 5E helps you unlock the realms of fantasy to experience them all.\nWelcome to Anime 5E \u2013 the fantasy role-playing game for all your anime and manga adventures, which builds upon the Fifth Edition rules of the world\u2019s most popular storytelling game. Mark MacKinnon, creator of the critically acclaimed Big Eyes, Small Mouth anime role-playing game, brings a point-based balance to the standard Fifth Edition offerings \u2013 and then layers a wide selection of new Races, Classes, Skills, features, powers, game mechanics, and combat options on top of this foundation. Anime 5E is the beginning of a journey, so hold on tight as we welcome you to your next great fantasy adventure!\nJoin the growing Anime 5E RPG community group on Facebook!\nAnime 5E RPG Core Rules\nPublished under the Open Game License, this single Anime 5E core role-playing game book contains everything you need to start creating and playing anime and manga RPG adventures. It works as an excellent expansion and companion to other Fifth Edition books as well, offering a unique perspective on traditional fantasy tabletop gaming. Whether you run with Anime 5E by itself or integrate it with other 5E resources, you'll be well prepared to unleash dynamic and dramatic action at your gaming table!\nThis gorgeous volume offers a solid 272 full-colour pages with over 100 beautiful illustrations from talented artist across the world. Anime 5E features a laminated hardcover with a durable Smyth-sewn binding that allows your book to easily lay flat and stay open to any page.\nInside the pages of Anime 5E, you'll find:\nA flexible, point-based approach to character features that lets you acquire the specific elements you envision for your character\n14 new races that cover a wide range of anime archetypes\nGuidelines and rules for playing characters other then medium-size\n14 new classes that offer incredible diversity in abilities and talents\nRebalanced standard Fifth Edition classes to level out character abilities\n70 wide-ranging character features (called Attributes), each with multiple ranks that expand their scope and utility\n36 character flaws (called Defects) that return points to your character so they can power up in different ways to compensate\n50 skill proficiencies that build upon the original Fifth Edition offerings and expand into numerous non-combat scenarios, talents, and trades\nA veritable treasure trove of combat enhancements and options, including called shots, critical hits and failures, tactical actions, range penalties, dramatic feats, and more\nAn innovative approach to calculating the Challenge Rating of monsters that considers their full range of features, abilities, and talents \u2013 both in and out of combat\nDozens of example adventuring gear, items of power, and fascinating daily devices\nRebuilds of 14 standard fantasy monsters across the Challenge Rating spectrum\nCheck out the gorgeous and evocative wrap-around cover by the talented Chabibit, and then click to download the Anime 5E table of contents so you can preview what's inside.\nAnime 5E Deluxe Limited Edition Core RPG\nDedicated anime gamers and Fifth Edition role-playing aficionados won't want to miss out on this stunning version of the game: the Anime 5E Limited Edition Core RPG. The Anime 5E logo is stamped in silver foil onto a rich black leatherette cover, the pages are accented with silver gilded edges, and the binding is enhanced with a handy bookmark ribbon to keep your place while playing. Otherwise, the interior contents are the same as the regular Anime 5E edition.\nThe Anime 5E Deluxe Limited Edition Core RPG will normally not be purchasable in retail stores and is available exclusively during this Kickstarter. We are only printing a limited number of this edition, with a small number of extra copies to anticipate late pledge manager add-ons. Should any copies remain after the Kickstarter is fulfilled, we will only offer them at conventions and through direct web store sales while quantities last.\nAnime 5E RPG Core Rules \u2013 Pocket Edition\nThe Anime 5E Pocket Edition is the ideal entry point into the game for backers who are looking for a smaller, portable book format at half the price of the standard full-colour hardcover edition. Printed in the familiar manga-sized dimensions on a textured uncoated paper stock with paperback cover, the Anime 5E Pocket Edition weighs in at a hefty 384 black-and-white pages. Most of the content from the regular hardcover edition is included in this alternate format \u2013 including all rules, races, and classes, and monsters \u2013 using a slightly smaller font size and fewer illustrations. Chapter 12 (plus two brief designer note appendicies) from the regular edition, which provides player and DM guidance, has been omitted to keep the page count (and thus cost) lower. Use the Anime 5E Pocket Edition solo as your primary game book, or as an additional inexpensive reference copy for your gaming table.\nAnime 5E Game Screen and Adventure\nThis handy, 4-panel reference screen for Masters of the Dungeon features a one-stop location for important Anime 5E tables, wrapped in a stunning full-colour panoramic image on the front that expands the dragon lair Anime 5E cover image scene with additional characters and monsters. As a bonus, inside you\u2019ll find \"Carry on Wayward Son\" \u2013 an engaging 32-page introductory fantasy adventure for 2nd-4th level characters, written by Andrew J Lucas. The adventure incorporates aspects of a traditional dungeon crawl with pet monster tournament battles, familial intrigue, and political machinations.\nWith gorgeous art and an intriguing story narrative, this Anime 5E Game Screen and Adventure is a must-have addition to your Fifth Edition anime RPG collection.\nAnime 5E Character Folio\nSome players desire more than a simple character sheet to present their creation. The Anime 5E Character Folio is the ultimate journal for detailing characters from any style of game campaign. The 24-page folio includes: a deluxe character sheet with expanded areas for abilities and descriptions; sections for detailing your character\u2019s features, talents, weapons, flaws, spells, items, companions, vehicles, treasure, dice situations, background, family, goals, and personality; and journal pages on which you can record your character\u2019s profile, inner thoughts, group dynamics, secrets learned during each session, and other important game notes. The bonus free PDF version included with the print edition includes fillable text entries as well.\nYou can customise your Anime 5E Kickstarter pledge to your exact specifications by selecting the reward level that most closely matches what you want to receive, and then selecting additional add-ons from the pop-up list of options presented with your pledge level. For example, to add the $25 Anime 5E RPG Pocket Edition to your $50 Gamer Pledge, simply choose the Gamer level and then click the add button for the Pocket Edition. It's that easy! And of course, add-on funds unrelated to shipping count towards qualifying stretch goal pledges as well (so a $50 Gamer Pledge + two $25 Pocket Edition add ons counts as a $100 pledge for stretch goal qualifications). \nIf necessary, you'll later identify any additional funds added to your campaign once we send you the link to our BackerKit survey in April a couple of weeks after the Kickstarter has ended. Note that adding on extra items to your pledge may increase your shipping costs, as indicated in the section below.\nAll funds that you add on NOW during the Kickstarter will contribute towards the campaign's stretch goals \u2013 but not add-ons made after the campaign ends during the BackerKit! \u2013 so be sure you top up your pledge TODAY to create the right package of products for you instead of waiting.\nYou'll get exclusive early access to the digital PDFs in your pledge level when the physical books are sent to press in May 2021. We'll use industry leader, DriveThruRPG.com, to deliver all PDF content. For physical copies, we will calculate and charge shipping separately later through BackerKit to provide the best possible rates for your rewards and add-ons.\nAdding physical rewards to digital-only pledge levels will incur shipping fees with a minimum charge equal to the most similar physical pledge level. In unique situations where you add physical rewards to digital-only pledge levels and BackerKit undercharges you for the shipping cost, an additional freight fee will be billed through Paypal before shipping. If you have questions about these shipping fees, please email info@dyskami.ca.\nShipping costs are included in the table below based on the provided pledge levels. Add-ons with your pledge may increase your shipping costs, as indicated in the chart. Of course, shipping cost do not count towards qualify pledge amounts for stretch goal considerations (for example, a stretch goal requiring a $100 qualifying pledge cannot include shipping costs in the amount needed to reach $100).\nPlease note that physical rewards for this Kickstarter are unavailable to ship to the following countries: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nThere are many excellent reason to make a pledge during this Kickstarter campaign, and we want to make the decision easy for you.\nEvery pledge for physical book copies also comes with FREE copies of their PDFs from DriveThruRPG as well, which are delivered promptly in May after the Kickstarter ends and you finalise your pledge \u2013 and that adds up to a huge savings!\nSince PDFs of the new releases won't be made available on DriveThruRPG until June/July \u2013 and you'll receive your files in May \u2013 you'll get a month of exclusive early access to the PDFs for your pledge!\nFor physical books, we ship to our Kickstarter backers as soon as the freight arrives in our warehouse \u2013 well before the distribution chain receives their copies. This means you'll have your copies up to one to two months before they are available in stores! \nYour pledge funds contribute towards unlocking valuable stretch goals during the campaign that allows us to give you even more Anime 5E awesomeness!\nFinally, funds from pledges like yours that push the campaign above the minimum threshold go directly to advancing work on a potential Anime 5E game line. This means we can reprioritise our work schedule, and allocate more resources towards creating and improving amazing future products at Dyskami.\nThis direct-to-consumers Kickstarter is a vital component for launching an Anime 5E line and distributing it worldwide. Dyskami Publishing and Japanime Games strongly supports the efforts of independent game retailers as well, and has created a $2 retailer-only pledge level for verifiable brick-and-mortar stores. This pledge locks in your store's access to all physical product available in the Kickstarter, including all add-ons. No further payment is due at this time. We will reach out and work you with you to complete your order in May, so your store will gain early access to the products and stretch goals before they are available through distribution. Please contact us directly (info@dyskami.ca) for more information how we can work together to help support the Anime 5E line at your store.\nDyskami Publishing Company is a tabletop game designer and publisher headquartered in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Dyskami's founder and award-winning game designer, Mark MacKinnon, serves as the lead designer for the Anime 5E line. In addition to relaunching anime role-playing game lines, Dyskami Publishing also designs a licensed line of tabletop games featuring the popular Japanese anime series, Sailor Moon Crystal.

Adapt what you like and make the ideas in this book your own!\nSome highlights from this installment include:\nThe Secret History of the Grandfather of Assassins\nThe Priest-Liches of Chernobog\nTriflin' Ass Gods and Minor Godlings\nNew Adventure Locations like Kaltaraag \u201cthe Graveyard of Dragons\u201d and The Ghostlight Cairn\nAll New Secret Organizations and Diabolical Cults\nNew Magical Items\nEvil Books and Sorcerous Tomes\nAlternate High-Level Monk Techniques\n4 All-New, Fully Illustrated Monsters\nAn All-New Adventure - The Cursed Barrow of the Whispering Skulls \n.... and Lots More!\nHere's what you WON'T find inside of The Phylactery - endless charts describing monsters and concepts you've seen a hundred times or a bunch of rules that you already have duplicated over a half dozen better-known books. Everything we've put in here is fully intended to generate ideas, spark your imagination, launch new adventures and fill in the little details that make gaming around the table with your friends so memorable in the first place.\nThe Shade-Druids of Usk-Var by Chris Carman\nThe Heresy of Chernobog, by Adrian Landeros\nIllustration by Ala Fedorova\nHOW TO PLEDGE FOR MULTIPLE COPIES\nIf a single copy won't do it for you or you need to order for a friend, no need to bargain your soul to ancient liches in forbidden crypts. You will be able to add as many print copies as your black heart desires in the post campaign pledge manager.\nRETAILER PLEDGE LEVEL\nOne of the things Planet X Games has always been proud of is our support for the FLGS - those brick and mortar Friendly Local Game Stores. In these strange times we've found ourselves in, we need them more than ever. If you are a retailer, this is the pledge level for you!\nThe Blight Hag, illustrated by Adrian Landeros\nSHIPPING\nShipping fulfillment is done through our friends at Exalted Funeral. Media Mail shipping up to 1 lb will be $5.50, shipped in a cardboard mailer.  Add-ons will not be a fixed price for shipping. \nRetailer pledge shipping should be under $6, although retailers can still pledge for add-ons in the pledge manager so shipping could possibly be well over this rate.\nINTERNATIONAL BACKERS\nNow that we have teamed up with Exalted Funeral for fulfillment, we DO allow for international shipping once again!\nTYPICALLY,  shipping is in the range of $10.65 - $12.75 for up to 8oz and $12.75 - $15.90 up to 1 lb for most countries. That is not a hard and fast rate and our rates will change as the USPS changes. International backers choose the same pledge level as US backers and then choose the appropriate shipping prices in their shipping survey.\nThe Witch-Maw Troll, illustrated by Adrian Landeros\nADD-ONS:\nDid you miss out on any of our prior projects? No worries - Planet X has got your back. All of our previous products will be available as add-ons and when your backer survey comes at the end of the Kickstarter, you\u2019ll be given an opportunity to get in on anything you may have missed:\nJungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride\nAn Occurrence at Howling Crater\nEscape from Skullcano Island\nGlimmering Crypt of the Ioun King\nThe Phylactery #1\nThe Phylactery #2\nJungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride ($21 backer-only price)\nTales of the cursed pyramid and the sleeping tomb of the Mummy Bride have long been a traveler\u2019s tale, passed along by wayward explorers and greedy plunderers alike. Deep within the verdant jungles of the south, amidst a Green Hell of impenetrable jungle, savage cannibals and ancient myth, lies the shattered remnants of a once-powerful civilization and the terrible gods who ruled over them. Rumors swirl of untold riches and un-plundered magic for those brave (or foolish!) enough to claim it. Will your players survive\u2026 and what will be left of them? Jungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride is a 5E adventure module suitable for levels 5-7.\nAn Occurrence at Howling Crater ($29 backer-only price)\nBrutal tales of the desolate, unforgiving wasteland known as Howling Crater have long caused travelers and caravan masters to give it a wide berth, but now fresh accounts of depravity and madness have begun to circulate out of that forbidden wasteland. Deep within the barren recesses of the crater, a murderous family of inbred, mutated crater folk have begun to preach the gospel of the \"the glory of the glow\" and with it has come incurable sickness and murderous incursions across the land. Even stranger rumors have made the rounds as of late, whispering of a long-forgotten civilization of steel and fire, born in a swirling inferno of radioactive dust and powered by ancient alien astronaut-gods, lost deep within the crater's recesses.\nCan your characters fight their way past this mutated, maniacal cult of alien-worshipping hillbillies to explore the truth of Howling Crater? Do they dare penetrate the inner mysteries of an ancient crashed ship and put a stop to the biological terrors that now run loose? Will they discover the true, terrifying secret behind the horrible happenings at Howling Crater?!\nAn Occurrence at Howling Crater is a 5E adventure module suitable for levels 7-9.\nEscape from Skullcano Island ($47 backer-only price)\nOminous signs have been sweeping across the land. Forbidding skies stained the color of blood. Thunderous, bestial sounds roaring from across the sea. Natural disasters of all varieties are raging uncontrollably across the land. Through it all, rumors swirl of strangely-clad heretics and wild-eyed blasphemers running amok, whispering prophecies of annihilation. What is happening\u2026 and why?\nLearned folk of every race have assembled with the most renowned oracles and seers of our age in an effort to discover what is truly happening. They all point to one place as the source of their collective woe \u2013 the primeval jungles and untouched shores of the legendary Skullcano Island!\nEscape from Skullcano Island is a hardback 5E adventure module suitable for levels 15-20.\nGlimmering Crypt of the Ioun King ($21 backer-only price)\nTavern tales and campfire talk across the land whisper of a glittering, gem-laden tomb deep beneath the sunlit lands of the surface, the final resting place of a doomed dwarven wizard who delved deep into the heart of the earth seeking answers\u2026 but found something else.  Something went awry deep within those cyclopean vaults far beneath the surface, unleashing something that wasn't meant for the mortal world. What happened to this famed dwarven wizard... and does danger still lurk in the Glimmering Crypt of the Ioun King?\nGlimmering Crypt of the Ioun King is a 5E adventure module suitable for level 5-7.\nThe Phylactery zine No. 1 ($10 backer-only price)\nThe Phylactery is a cover-to-cover 48-page, saddle-stitched, 5.5-inch by 8.5-inch B&W printed zine with a bad ass color cover by Planet X favorite Ed Bickford. This booklet is jam packed with page after page of heroic fantasy adventure influenced heavily by early third party RPG badassery like Dave Hargrave\u2019s infamous  Arduin Grimoire series and the early Dragontree Press stuff. The Phylactery is meant to be a quick and easy resource that you can pull ideas and plot hooks from for use directly at your gaming table. There\u2019s no fluff in here and nothing padding out the page count - just pure old school goodness created exclusively for the fantasy gaming community. We have absolutely JAM-PACKED a ton of OSR goodness in here for you.\nThe Phylactery zine No. 2 ($10 backer-only price)\nThere was such an amazing reception to the first issue of The Phylactery that the creative team here at Planet X Games put together a sequel and this one is bigger, badder and louder in every respect, with the same heart and feel of the old school heroic fantasy RPGs we grew up playing back in the day. This is plug-n-play gaming at its best and the resources you find in these pages can be put directly to use in your home games. The Phylactery 2 is a cover-to-cover 48-page, saddle-stitched, 5.5-inch by 8.5-inch B&W printed zine with a full color cover by DC/Wildstorm comics artist Tony Avina and is packed full of OSR resources for your home table.\nSubterranean critters abound! Art by JE Shields", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs it currently stands, this project is 100% written. Both cover and ALL interior art is turned in. We move forward with a rigorous editing process from here so that we can give you the very best content possible. This may mean some articles get cut and new ones get added but the end goal is to give you a zine with as much usable plug-n-play content that you can get right to your table as soon as possible. We are waiting on the project to be funded before we compile the final PDFs, so they have not been hosted as of this writing. As with any crowdfunding program, the time between payment and delivery of the final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of the supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, as well as changes in the prices of materials and shipping. Having said that, we have a great reputation and a proven track record here on Kickstarter. We are ready to get this project moving and get it into your hands as soon as possible! Having said that, we are in the age of COVID-19 and that has the chance to add its own set of challenges if things should take a turn.

While we focus on DCC, the material produced can be easily translated into any Old School Renaissance (OSR) system, or even 5th edition D&D\u2014something several of our reviewers have noticed as well!\n\nBut I don't play DCC/MCC\u2014what can Tales from the Smoking Wyrm provide me for my game?\nHow about stellar content, wonderful random tables, and system agnostic ideas? Many if not all of our articles can be used by non-DCC players with minimal translation fuss! In fact, over 90% of our content is usable by an OSR system with literally no translation. Don't believe us? How about listening to our reviews:\n\n What people are saying about Tales from the Smoking Wyrm!\nThe first thing you'll notice about this zine is that it is erudite. The creators discuss their sources as well as the history of the hobby. If that sort of thing excites you, then you will certainly enjoy this.\n\u2014Daniel Bishop, DCC Trove of Treasures\n\nTales from the Smoking Wyrm is perhaps the finest general fantasy fanzine for Dungeon Crawl Classics. Think along the lines of Crawl! but more packed in per issue. A comparison to Crawl! is extremely high praise if you aren't hip to it... These things smell good too, like actually printed thing.\n\u2014Weird Realms, Cleveland, Ohio\n\nThis zine is a work of genius, go buy it now.\n\u2014Stephen, Stephen's Hobby Workshop\n\nThe entire zine is great, each article is well crafted, usually zines have an article or two that isn\u2019t as good as the others, but all the articles in this zine are high quality and worth your time to read and implement in your DCC game.  I like that a lot of the content is easily portable to other games.  The question is implied at the end of the editor\u2019s note, do the authors see a little further as they stand upon the shoulders of giants?  I say, yes, you all see further together and have provided us with an excellent product.\n\u2014Jim May, Dragon Treks\n\nI got Tales of the Smoking Wyrm in their magnificent Risograph printing and it is glorious! Not only it's a tome of wisdom and great gaming content, it's sturdy, has great paper and is filled with great art and beautiful layout!\n\u2014Diogo Nogueira\n\n What's Inside?\nThe third issue will contain seven features, usable by both players and judges! Each article will be featured in greater detail in future Kickstarter updates so you have a good sense of what you will be getting, but here is a short list:\n Patrons: Dor Nyvs\u2014Archomentals were first introduced in the AD&D Fiend Folio as Elemental Princes of Evil, and then expanded upon in the AD&D Manual of the Planes. Here, we bring one of the five earth archomentals to life with a full write-up on how you too, can work with the Dweller at the Core!\n Rites & Rituals, Part III\u2014We finish out our three-part article on rituals with two very cool additions\u2014creating homunculi and making your land float in the sky! Seriously\u2014who doesn't want a floating fortress!?!\n Cullpepper's Herbal\u2014More herbs for your game!  This time, we feature three closely related fungi from the agaric family\u2014Black, Red, and Death's Head Agaric are all waiting for you to delve into! No adventurer should be without these fungi!\n The Tentacular\u2014What has five tentacles, a beak for devouring the souls of wizards, and lots of eyes in that cute furry head? This article introduces you to the Tentacular, a monster near and dear to many people's hearts, that dwells in the largest of cities, or the most deserted of deserts!\n You Too Can Gongfarm!\u2014Expanding the occupations table a bit to make it more racially diverse and equal-opportunistic.\n Onward Retainer, starring the Legion\u2014The third installment of our adventuring comic in an old school style, brought to you by Joel Phillips!\n Wyrm Words\u2014A crossword puzzle of all the Gygaxian words in the third issue\u2014this way, a definition is never in doubt! Also included are the answers to the second issue's Wyrm Words.\n\nWhat You Will Get\nA tabletop RPG megazine usable by players and judges\nDigest size (approximately 5 \u00bc by 8 \u00bc )\n60 pages inside cover to cover\nTwo-color interior\n Articles by: Trevor Stamper, Brian Gilkison, and John Olszewski\n Art by: Joel Phillips, Carmin Vance, Brian Maikisch, Bradley McDevitt, Michael Harmon, Jae Tanaka, Diogo Nogueira, and Trevor Stamper\n Limited Risograph Print Edition\u2014cover stock almost identical to the early 70s era \"White Box\" edition of Dungeons & Dragons and its supplements (Greyhawk; Blackmoor; Eldritch Wizardry; Gods, Demi-gods & Heroes; Swords & Spells); heavy archival-quality interior paper meant to hand down to your children as a prized possession; hand numbered for print backers (as per backing level\u2014not every level gets this item). Our Risograph version is printed by a small business in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n PDF and Print on Demand (POD) versions of the third issue\u2014available (as per backing level\u2014not every level gets these items; POD must still be purchased at cost from DriveThruRPG by those who support at that level)\n\nSupport Levels \nUnique Hand-Colored Artwork Support Tiers\nEvery Kickstarter we roll out a custom artwork support tier. These support levels help support our efforts, and we provide the artist with an additional payment for their efforts. With this Kickstarter, we are offering 5 uniquely hand-colored art prints of the cover to Tales from the Smoking Wyrm #3, by Joel Phillips. \nUNIQUE INK #1: \"Smoking Wyrm Cover #3, hand-colored #1\"\nUNIQUE INK #2: \"Smoking Wyrm #3, hand-colored #2\"\nUNIQUE INK #3: \"Smoking Wyrm Cover #3; Hand-colored #3\"\nUNIQUE INK #4: \"Smoking Wyrm cover #3, hand-colored, gauche & dyes, #4\"\nUNIQUE INK #5: \"Smoking Wyrm Cover #3; ALTERNATE COVER, Hand-colored, 1 of 2\"\nAdd-ons\nKickstarter has just started add-ons, so we are offering these from the get-go! These items are only offered when we do a Kickstarter\u2014you can get them nowhere else!\n$10\u2014Luck token set 1\n$10\u2014Luck token set 2\n$10\u2014Luck token set 3\n$15\u2014Premium storage box for issues 1-3 (also will fit your luck tokens and bookmarks)\n\nSmoking Wyrm Luck token set (add-on)\nA set of custom Smoking Wyrm Fleeting Luck tokens\u20145 for $10, with a unique luck action on the back side.  We produced 5 unique luck tokens for each of our first two issues, and we are adding to the set with another 5 for this issue! We have a few luck token sets from issues 1 and 2 still available as well\u2014so add $10 to your pledge for each set you want.\nTop 2 rows: front + back of set #1; bottom 2 rows: front + back of set #2\nThese luck tokens are high-quality poker chips with custom printing on the front and back! They have a great heft and feel wonderful as you clink them back and forth, preparing to use them!\n\nPremium Storage box for issues 1-3 (add-on)\nBy now, many of you have our first two issues of Tales from the Smoking Wyrm, with the third being offered in this very Kickstarter, and no where to store these precious gems! Well, you are in luck, for this Kickstarter ONLY, we are offering a foil-stamped storage box for these treasured artifacts! Made of 60 pt chipboard, clad in foreboding matte black, with gold foil stamping of the Smoking Wyrm sign on the cover, this 1 inch thick box will hold up to 3 issues our zine (either the limited edition, or the POD versions)! It is the ultimate way to secure your copies and take them to the game (whenever we return to normal in-person games, post-pandemic, of course). The boxes are made by a local company in nearby Marion, Indiana.\nThe Smoking Wyrm sign will grace the cover of the box, with the black being a brassy gold foil! The left spine of the box will say Tales from the Smoking Wyrm on it!\nSTRETCH GOAL OVERVIEW\nWe moved most of our stretch goals straight to add-ons, and are offering nearly everything up front. However, we do have 2 stretch goals, tied to number of backers. For the backer level goals we have:\n 250 backers\u2014EVERYONE gets a bookmark! We will ship the bookmarks to everyone, even the digital ONLY backers.This bookmark will allow you to track those herbs with ease. Laminated in a sturdy 5 mil lamination for extra durability.\n 400 backers\u2014PDF rules for random tentacular nests! We have been working on a random tentacular nest generator, which allows you to build a complete tentacular nest (think 3D dungeon) in minutes! If we hit 400 backers, we will finish this up and will include it as a FREE PDF for everyone who backs the kickstarter! This will mean you can create a tentacular nest to terrify your players on the fly, with almost no prep work!\n\nShipping Costs\nWe will be using media mail for shipping the books, and priority mail for shipping books + tokens. Each order will ship in a sturdy cardboard envelope via media mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN PLEDGE LEVELS. At the time of launch, shipping and handling for the United States of America is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped, or $8-10 if you order multiple books. Add-ons incur their own additional shipping and handling charges.\n\nWe haver also started offering shipping to Canada along with our standard shipping to the Untied States. Canadian shipping prices start at $15 and go up, based upon reward tier, and the number of add-ons you are looking at. Shipping to Canada comes with tracking.\n\nWe ship your products in a plastic bag inside rigid mailers, so even if the outside box gets wet, the products inside should be safe and sound. Further, we ship luck tokens shrink wrapped to a card backer for added protection during shipping.\n\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA & Canda ONLY. We looked long and hard at shipping internationally, but the current prices for shipping outside the USA & Canada are just outrageous. It isn't that we don't want to ship to everyone, but the prices make it hard to justify (and would, in fact, be more than price of the product itself). Further, we cannot guarantee the booklet will arrive in good order once it leaves USPS hands. For these reasons, we simply cannot offer the limited edition product outside the United States.\n\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter funds the creative writers, artists, and design team who have helped bring this issue to life. It will also pay for the limited-edition printing for the high-quality Riso print run, and stretch goals.\n\nWhere does the project come from?\nFor forty years we have been playing games, and building campaign worlds across all editions of D&D, as well as many other games. During that time, we have created a lot of content that our own players have loved. Tales from the Smoking Wyrm takes our knowledge and focuses it into articles for every table, every player, and every judge!\n\nWhat is the plan?\n1) The Kickstarter ends and we wait for transfer of funds! After that, we will post the pdf of issue 3 for backer review. This version is just preliminary\u2014intended for backers to look over the material and help us STOMP typos! It may be missing art and other features\u2014but those will get done!\n1.5) You get issues 1 and 2 in PDF and/or POD! We will send out PDF and POD codes for DriveThruRPG downloads of issues 1 and 2 to all who qualify for them at this time as well.\n2) We Stomp the Typos! We have supported hundreds of Kickstarters (literally!), and we notice that the very best ones allow for some crowdsourcing of stomping out typos. So, we will allow for two weeks to stomp out the typos! You can report typos on our own website, and we will work these into the editing process for fixing! In the end, we all get a better product.  After all, who wants a wonderful Riso printed limited edition book when it has typos in it?\n3) Final corrections!  We will update the issue 3 PDF on DriveThruRPG.com, and prep the POD version, which will also need a test print ordered. This is the part where we get the file for the Riso print ready as well!\n4) Review the test prints!  Once we are happy with the physical and POD test prints, we will release them for printing! For some of you, this will be the fulfillment of the Kickstarter, but for many of you, there is one more step!\n5) SHIPPING! We will securely package issue 3\u2014along with any stretch goals\u2014and ship them out to all of you.\n6) Issue 4 is just around the corner! We are deep into writing the next four issues already, with lots of awesome content to drive some seriously crazy roleplaying sessions! For those who back at the \"designer access\" level, as soon as the Kickstarter ends we will give you access to our private Facebook group, where we are deep at work on articles and art for issue 3 and beyond. Come share in the crazy process, and let us hear your voice!\n What is Dungeon Crawl Classics? \nDungeon Crawl Classics is a tabletop role-playing game published by Goodman Games. DCC uses modern mechanics to allow players to experience adventures in line with the heroes described throughout the sword-and-sorcery genre that inspired Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson to create the first role-playing game. Find out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\n About the Wyrm's Creators \n Trevor Stamper\u2014Trevor has had aspirations of being a Not-Quite-As-Dark Master for numerous years, tormenting players in home campaigns on at least two continents. At the age of 10, Trevor was launched into an AD&D game with his friends on Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. But once he moved to England, he lost touch with the game and explored other classics\u2014Indiana Jones, Twilight 2000, Gangbusters, Traveller 2300\u2014 until Joel Phillips reintroduced him to D&D BECMI style when he was 15. From the start, tinkering with the rules was just common sense to him\u2014in fact, one of the items featured in Issue #1\u2014The Silver Ball\u2014originated in games from this time period run for a game at the infamous Golden Dragons Gaming Club on Woodbridge AFB, and has been stewing there for almost 30 years! From there it has been a life-long passion for gaming and creating things other players can enjoy. Trevor has published before in minor ways\u2014a few articles in the now defunct ENWorld Journal, and some really minor contributions when Kobold Press was doing Open Design. He has also extensively playtested material for almost thirty years\u2014starting with Werewolf first edition for White Wolf, to most recently a plethora of Fantasy Flight Games' offerings in the Warhammer 40K and Star Wars ranges. After 183 Kickstarters as a backer, this is his third one as a creator!\n John Olszewski\u2014John is a scientist, Marine, amateur woodworker, and of course, gamer. Born in a small town on the shores of Lake Erie in Western New York, he is also a lifelong Buffalo Bills and Sabres fan, traveled the world (four continents and counting) and played or ran games everywhere he\u2019s gone. Starting out in junior high school, back in the 1980s with 1st edition D&D, he has been playing ever since. Of the many systems, his favorites include D&D/Pathfinder, World of Darkness, Shadowrun, Warhammer 40K, and now DCC. John met Trevor back in 1997 in New Mexico when they were both in grad school and have been working together since then on world development and game rules for various campaigns, including Nearn\u2014a fantasy ringworld that the Wyrm will touch upon from time to time. In that time, he's playtested extensively for Fantasy Flight Games on their Warhammer 40K and Star Wars games, as well as Ulisses Spiele\u2019s 40K game, and products from Paradigm Concepts and Eden Studios, and been a member of the RPGA and the University of Buffalo\u2019s Strategists and Role Players Association (UB SARPA).\n Brian Gilkison\u2014Nowhere near as evil as Trevor or John (more of a clueless minion, really), Brian first came to gaming through the Holmes box set for D&D; in that same summer, Star Wars was released, and he first read The Hobbit\u2014so he feels like he comes by his geekdom honestly. He was an administrator, writer, and DM for the Ohio region of the RPGA\u2019s Living Greyhawk campaign, and a writer and DM for the followup 4th edition campaign, Living Forgotten Realms. Like Trevor and John, he was also a playtester on the 40K and Star Wars lines from Fantasy Flight Games. It is possible that he may secretly be in charge of his local chapter of the Esoteric Order of Dagon.\n Joel Phillips\u2014Just can\u2019t keep a dude down! Joel was introduced to the world of gaming in 1985 (5th grade) by playing the BECMI edition of D&D, and through the Endless Quest and Fighting Fantasy books. The Fighting Fantasy books inspired Joel to do art. His efforts redoubled when Joel moved to Woodbridge AFB in 1988 and he met Trevor\u2014and the two have been gaming together ever since! Joel went on to the Joe Kubert School for Cartoon Graphic Design to learn more about the trade, but had since fallen away from doing art until reinvigorated by Trevor and Brian's incessant pestering. A lover of all things Warhammer, Joel believes that the Games Workshop brand of games has consumed his life for almost 30 years. Beyond that, Joel has run very successful D&D, Warhammer Fantasy, and Dark Heresy games over the years. Producing the \"Onward Retainer\" comic for the Smoking Wyrm has been a fun revisit to the world of art\u2014and he is now hard at work drafting up the next few episodes. Joel is also an avid blogger, running the Neverness Hobby Chronicles, where he reviews gaming fiction, and paints lots of Orky goodness!\n Caitlin Stamper\u2014Caitlin grew up in a gaming household. Whether it was playing a precocious intelligent mouse at the age of 5 (squeak!), or a groovy witch at the age of 20, she has never known a life where there is something other than a bi-weekly game table (or better yet\u2014weekly\u2014those were the days!) to beckon you to adventure. A Purdue graduate in professional writing and graphic design, Caitlin has the built-in skill set to enable our ideas to bloom on the printed page! She is now seeking the adventures of adult life\u2014editing and designing things to make the world a better place. Caitlin has now gone on to her first professional job as a designer for a major book publisher, so the Smoking Wyrm is something she does out of love of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTales from the Smoking Wyrm issue 3 is completely written, rough laid-out, and with over 75% of the artwork finished already or in commission.

Now, with SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No. 3, we are really starting to hit our barbaric stride \u2014 and the winner is you, the discerning post-apocalyptic gamer.\nWhat\u2019s a Megazine?\nBigger and better than a fanzine, not quite as fancy as a magazine, SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.3 is a megazine. It\u2019s 6\u201d x 9\u201d in size, with 64+ pages of professional gaming content created and produced by industry veterans. Our megazines are also perfect-bound with a spine, so they stand up nicely on a shelf as you collect them! This is an exciting new format we here at Mudpuppy Games are proud to pioneer, and we can\u2019t wait to see how many others adopt what we think is a pretty handy format for jamming a publication straight into your game bag or your backpack.\nAdventures and arthropods and artifacts, oh my!\nConsummate Constructs and Cogent Conjurations\nThis issue contains all the regular features you know and love, many returning authors and artists, and some great new additions to our roster of rabble-rousers.

Tim Kask gives us a new-school look at an old-school tradition, with Unfamiliar Familiars (for Post-Apocalyptic Games). Need a whole inventory of random artifacts of the Ancient Ones guaranteed not to blow up your campaign world for a change? Ian McGarty is here to help with his hilarious The Broken Earth Catalog. Daniel J. Bishop joins our ranks to bring us a heady meditation on how to genre-mash your fantasy game with post-apocalytptic content in You Got Data Chips in My Ellxiir, and if all that wasn\u2019t enough, this issues mini-adventure is called Holding Up The Sky by our own Jim Wampler. If a far-future adventure with hints of Greek mythology is your jam, then this one is for you.\nAnd of course, our Scientific Comics section returns with dynamite episodes of Knights of the Dinner Table by Jolly Blackburn, Onto the Wasteland by Travis Hanson, and John Darkeye: The Last Good Thief by Dan Smith.\nCheck out the Table of Contents below:\nWhen we say No.3 is bigger and better, this is what we mean. Look at that content!\nNot Just for the Radioactive at Heart\nSure, all this great new gaming material has been designed with the discriminating post-apocalyptic gamer in mind, but it is also eminently suitable for fantasy games \u2014 especially if your campaign needs a fresh jolt of excitement. In both the pulp literature that inspired our hobby and in the fantasy games of yore, many a magic item or monster turned out to have scientific origins. The contents of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN are ideal for getting seen-it-all done-it-all fantasy players back on their toes and engaged with new surprises. All material presented is usable with any d20-based game system.\nBacker-Only EXCLUSIVE!\nBACKER EXCLUSIVE: Need a new monster or treasure for tonight's game? It's indexed right here.\nThe CRYPTIC CONCORDANCE is a backer-only exclusive not available to the general public. It contains an art-filled index of every mutant, monster, machine, or malevolent magic that has appeared in issues No.1\u2014No.3 of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN, plus any of the same that appeared in our books Check This Artifact and Fight This Mutant. Each entry is cross-referenced by book and page number, just to make a GM\u2019s life that much easier when it\u2019s time to add a new creature, class, spell, or artifact to their post-apocalyptic or genre-mashed fantasy game.\nHow to Pledge for Multiple Copies\nNeed to pledge for multiple copies of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.3? Just select the pledge level for the PRINT + PDF and fill out the dollar amount in multiples of $15 (i.e., $30 for two copies, $45 for three copies, etc).\nRetailer Pledge Level\nEspecially in these difficult times, we support all of our brick-and-mortar game stores. If you are a retailer and wish to pledge at the Retailer Pledge Level, all we ask is that you send us verification via email or messages after pledging.\nShipping Costs\nEach book will be shipped to backers via USPS in a sturdy cardboard envelope. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. Shipping and handling is an economical $5 per book shipped. Retailer shipping will be via Media Mail and is also only $5.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. Current International shipping costs are so high that shipping outside the USA is not feasible for Mudpuppy Games at this time. We know that sucks, but much larger companies with better resources than us have struggled with this and failed. Plus, we just can\u2019t bring ourselves to charge shipping costs in excess of the price of the product itself, and for that philosophy we can only apologize in advance.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThere aren\u2019t any! We\u2019re not fooling around here. The entirety of funds raised for this project are being devoted to creating one of the best new gaming zines around.

The twelve events featured will test luck, but also creativity and improvisation. Do you think you can cook a fry cake good enough for the king? How good are you at wrestling greased piglets?  Can you outrun an ooze down a slimed tunnel while tied to another hapless contender?\nAn unlucky contestant falls in Ettin Race\nWill you choose to go it alone, or form an alliance with the other competitors? Whatever you choose, only one player will be declared winner of the Tournament of Pigs!\nWhy Back?\n If you are an experienced Dungeon Master: The Tournament is an excellent introduction for new RPG players. No lengthy character creation; just roll a few characters each, explain the basics of D&D gameplay, and you're off! Have some friends that only play board games? ToP is an excellent game to get them into RPGs because there's a competitive scoring element involved.\n If you are a new Dungeon Master: Our campaign is unique in that each event is a sort of \"mini-game\" in the competition. We go the extra mile to really flesh out and explain all of the rules so that new Dungeon Masters don't have to do too much improvisation to \"fill in the gaps\" between what the rules expect the player to do and what the players actually do. Plus, the box set comes with everything you need to run the adventure, including standees for characters and monsters.\n If you are part of a Long Campaign: The Tournament is an excellent break from a lengthy adventure, it encourages players to break out of the mold of what they usually play, and enjoy the excitement of being in an adventure where their cannon-fodder characters can die at any moment.\n\n\nIn a Zero-Level adventure, instead of playing a full-fledged adventurer, players take on the role of a commoner: the local butcher, a goat farmer, a seamstress, a bouncer, a beggar, and over 70 additional occupations. These characters are quickly generated using the Zero-Level rules supplement (or the rules built into Dungeon Crawl Classics.)\nThe life-expectancy of a commoner thrust into deadly adventures is short, so players pre-generate enough characters to get them through the session.  A Zero-Level game has a more chaotic and bloody feel than a standard high-fantasy RPG.  \nWe have created a unique ruleset for creating commoners in 5E. This will be available as a print Add-On and is in the 5E version of the boxed set as well.\nThe King's mad mage, Falazar, has spent all year preparing the events to be featured in the tournament. The challenges vary from baleful bloodsport, to cooking competitions, to risky riddles, to pernicious puzzles. \nMaps by Michael Sean Piper\nFor our chapter samples, we've picked two that are light on spoilers. However, if you are planning on being a player in the game, do not read the text within; the fun of discovering the rules of the games on the fly will be ruined.\n\nUnlike most adventure modules, Tournament of Pigs is not fully cooperative. Players will be competing to score the most points by the end of the session, to be declared the winner. Just how competitive the players want to be is entirely up to them (and the GM). \nArtwork by legend Russ Nicholson\nThe adventure consists of a series of contests where players are challenged to discover a secret \"Silver Prize\" which unlocks access to the famed Silver Rack, and scores a player one point. Players must be careful, though, if their hapless commoner falls victim to a deadly trap, they will lose a point.  At the end of the tournament, the player with the most points is declared the victor!\nCrap Rack & Silver Rack\nWhen a character first enters the arena, they will be tasked with picking an item from the crap rack. What the item does won't be revealed until an action is taken on the front of the card. \nSome items are exactly as they appear, and some you won't know what they do until you take the action described and flip the card over. \nNo group of players has ever resisted opening the Small Steel Chest!\nThe Silver Rack features some slightly magical and much more mysterious items. Some have been placed by Falazar himself to aid in specific events. \nYou can add the money for your Add-Ons now, or later in the PledgeManager.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've been having a blast testing the Tournament of Pigs at cons across the country for the past three years it has been in development. Our players have done their best to throw a wrench in our events, solving problems in completely unexpected ways, and rolling amazingly unlikely dice results to flip seemingly insurmountable odds.\nStrategicon & Gary Con in 2019\nWe believe that testing is one of the most important parts of developing a game, and we've really put each event to the test in both Dungeon Crawl Classics and 5E playthroughs. \nAfter the completion of the campaign, you will need to check out with PledgeManager to confirm your address and pay shipping. At that point, you will also be able to purchase Add-Ons for your order.\nThe following grid summarizes approximate shipping costs.\nCalifornia, EU, and UK customers must pre-pay tax on their orders when checking out in the PledgeManager.

You're probably thinking those would make a great tracklisting for a metal album, and you'd probably be right.\nThis gaming zine is designed to make your evil priests on your tabletop more sinister and terrifying to face, channeling otherworldly horror and cinematic imagery.\nWorm Tunnel is a 5th level canticle available to followers of Herlezzect\nPutrescent Bog is one of the first level cleric spells\nThose are just a couple of examples of the treacherous magics contained within!\nPG-13?\nThis is a zine full of evil priest spells.

With that in mind, here are three combo deals meant to give you everything that you want.\nCombo 1 - Tome and Terror: The Tome of Debasement and Wide-eyed Terror Zines\nDid you miss out on the Wide-eyed Terror Zine Kickstarter earlier this month? Here's another chance to get in on the 1st printing. At this Backer Level you will receive print and PDF copies of both The Tome of Debasement and Wide-eyed Terror zines.\nCombo 2 - Tome, Terror, and Rabid Dogs: The Tome of Debasement, Wide-eyed Terror, and Rabid Dogs Zines\nWe get it, you love zines as much as we do. At this Backer Level you want to add a copy of the 2nd printing of Rabid Dogs Zine, our RPG zine debut from last year. This new 2nd printing fixes some typos, upgrades the only encounter map, and adds 4 more pages of content in the form of the Icon Bearer character class. All told, you will receive all 3 of our zines: The Tome of Debasement, Wide-eyed Terror, and Rabid Dogs zines in print and PDF formats. You will notice a substantial increase in shipping as we upgrade to a hard mailer.\nCombo 3 - Full Corruption: The Tome of Debasement, Wide-eyed Terror, Rabid Dogs Zines, and The Precipice of Corruption Adventure Module\nAre you a completist? Do you want to use the classes in Rabid Dogs Zine, while driving off the horrors from Wide-eyed Terror?

You will receive all 4 of our DCC RPG compatible releases: The Tome of Debasement, Wide-eyed Terror, and Rabid Dogs zines, along with our first adventure module, The Precipice of Corruption in print and PDF formats.

You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game.

This edition is revised and expanded from the previous Ghengis Con and Exalted Funeral's Free RPG 2 versions. The last version had 22 pages, this one will have 26 if no stretch goals are met.\nThe existing text has already been edited by Jarrett Crader  of the Moonrat Conspiracy (Ultra Violet Grasslands, Mothership stuff, Fever Swamp) and is getting some additional material based on things we've figured out from running and being players in it. We have also hit up Christian Kessler, also of the Moonrat Conspiracy (Silent Titans) to consult upon improving the layout.\nIt will be black and white photo copied digest sized. The card-stock cover will be removable with a double spread map on the inside spread. There will also be a loose card-stock sheet with frequently used tables that may serve as a bookmark. The goal of this zine is to be used during play to not only provide the adventure, but to also keep record of what has happened.\nMap of the Village Cerwin\nTrans-dimensional bees have set up a hive in the village of Cerwin. The halflings have all fallen on hard times. Blood Cults and Bee Cults vie for influence. People are getting high on some funky honey. \nThe zine is designed as a workbook to be written in during play with tables to figure out what gripes, grudges and goals motivate each NPC. \n\nNPC Worksheet\nNPC Generator Table\n\nAs the players go about the village they will interact with several factions. As members of a faction are killed, by the players or by other NPCs, or the inn burning down, whatever, tracks are filled up which indicate how the faction responds.\n\nSample Faction Page.\nStu Horvath from Vintage RPG  said,\n \"The focus here is on setting up the faction dominos, then letting the players come in and knock them all down. This sort of emergent story is always a good time, particularly if your group is like mine and never does what you expect (and tends to make a mess of solvable situations). There are some fun tools for tracking the local population and their relationships, too, which is always a draw for me.\nThe art is a standout, too: a nice mix of cartoonish and yucky that kind of remind me of Garbage Pail Kids or Big Daddy Roth.\"\nThe new stuff definitely getting added since the last version:\nA list of character names grouped by faction\nA table for what's going on in town when the party shows up or if there is a lull in the action\nNew art\nCrazy bees.\n\nFollowers of the Holy Hive\nWe'll be doing shirts again, silkscreen printed in Cleveland.\nBaseball Three quarter length sleeve t-shirt.\nIf you're really into Halflings and the Hive, you can also pick up a double sided 11x17 inch Risograph poster map, all the maps and some cool extra art. Along with this you will get a collection of accessories to help run the module. Firstly, 12 NPC folios, all of the random table entries on chits and a pot of Holy Honey Rubber Cement to affix the Gripes Grudges and Goals to the NPC folio. Additionally the deluxe version will come with cardstock miniatures of all of the creatures, cultists, humans and halflings of Cerwin, along with a few bears (these will come with all copies of the zine if the stretch goal is unlocked). We will also have  MDF faction death tracks and plastic tombstone markers. Lastly, we are creating a soundtrack that will help convey the misery and desperation and ceaseless buzzing of the bees. \nWe are also having one inch pinback buttons made.\nThe synths and pedals that will make the Drone Buzz drone\nA hobbi--- er, halfling, chilling\nShipping charges are collected through Kickstarter along with the pledge, so no surprises. \nEverything will be shipped by USPS with tracking, with guaranteed delivery.\nInternational shipping is admittedly crazy expensive, but it will have tracking. If you live outside of the United States and like to live on the razor's edge, we could ship you the zine only without tracking as an oversize letter. In this case we'd' only guarantee that we have sent it, we cannot guarantee receipt. This method will only cost you $6, and works only for the basic print pledge, contact us to make this arrangement. Just to reiterate, this will save you a few dollars but the risk of shipping without tracking in a regular envelope is on you.\nAll physical rewards will be going out at the same time in August, PDFs will go out once the new version is finalized (June in all likelihood, but not promising until August).\nTodd Jakubisin is a Cleveland Ohio based artist having illustrated board games such as Pests! and Flip-n-Finds Diner, and currently designs puzzles for Akron Ohio\u2019s alt news magazine; The Devil Strip. In the summer of 2020 he established Timepiece Press to create and house comics for all ages and unique greeting cards. This is his 4th kickstarter he is involved with.\nBeckett Warren runs Weird Realms, made his first zine more than 20 years ago (both issues even made the Maximum Rock n Roll zine top ten the month they were submitted for review!), has had writings published in organs of varying respectability, and has been writing songs for largely ignorable bands, most recently Cracked Cup.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the zine is done, the existing text has already been edited, the layout has been sent to CK to get it improved.

Bishop comes a dangerous adventure that pits players against monsters, nature, and even time itself.\nYou spy a semi-ruined inn on the road ahead, promising shelter from the dark woods that close in around you. But the inn is not deserted. Haunted by phantoms of the past, creatures of the present, and a malignant entity with dark designs for the future, you slip between all three timelines. As these timelines merge and horrors from the past slip into the present, you find yourself confronted by a dark and wild future that you may not be able to avoid. Worse, a future you may have helped to create!\nexample cover by Bartek Kucharski\nWhat is The Inn in the Forest?\nThe Inn in the Forest is a DCC RPG long-format, time-traveling, horror adventure by Daniel J. Bishop heavily influenced by the darker side of the Brothers Grimm, the moody ghost tales of M.R. James and William Hope Hodgson, and the horror stories of Robert E. Howard.\nProviding multiple nights of eerie entertainment as a stand-alone adventure or as a persistent part of a larger campaign, The Inn in the Forest is perfect for any DCC or OSR setting of any time period, including Weird Frontiers, Mutant Crawl Classics (MCC RPG), Shudder Mountains, Crawlthulu, OSRIC, and Labyrinth Lord.\nAs a player, you take the part of an unwitting traveler seeking shelter for the night. Whether drawn this direction to search for the lost magic of Zauberer the Hexmaster or following up on rumors of the innkeeper\u2019s dark practices, what you encounter is so much worse. Sometimes making it to dawn means success, other times it may just mean trading your companions\u2019 souls to gain the power the Waldgeist grants!\nAs a Judge, you will be running a unique adventure, where time is not static. Phantom shifts allow you to tell the story of the inn during its heyday as well its current state. As the PCs interact with the haunting of the inn\u2019s past, the very real threats of its present seek to destroy them. Rules on phantom shifts, as well as new monsters, items, artifacts, and rituals, are included to bring new dimensions of gameplay to your ttrpg.\nAuthor Interview with Daniel J.

Once the zine is complete and we are shipping the US version, we will also get it up on DriveThruRPG so you can order a print on demand copy.

DCC uses modern mechanics to allow players to experience sword and sorcery adventures in line with the Appendix N books that inspired Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson to create Dungeons & Dragons. You can download the free quick start rules at Goodman Games > Shop Now > Free DCC RPG Quick Start Rules. It includes rules up to level 2 so includes everything you need to play The Inn in the Forest.\nWhat is the Plan?\n1) Get funded. Once the Kickstarter ends, we wait for funds to transfer.  After that, all backers receive a PDF of the original preview edition that started it all.\n2) Commission art. Commission the final pieces of art and wrap up the initial editing.\n3) Playtest and fix typos. Backers at the Squire level and higher receive an early version of the zine in PDF format for playtesting and typo catching. We want everyone to get the best final product possible.\n4) Finalize content. We implement final art and revisions, then complete softcover, hardcover, and PDF layout. We also test and finalize all VTT + Convention Play Pack assets.\n5) Get things printed. We then order softcover and hardcover test prints and, once everything looks perfect, order the full print runs.\n6) Ship the zines, share the PDFs, and share the VTT + Convention Play Pack. We securely package your softcover and hardcover zines and ship those out, as well as release the final zine PDFs and VTT + Convention Play Pack assets. All backers receive the final version of their backer rewards.\n7) Start on the next zine. We already have new artists and content lined up for the next few zines, so will be sharing more about those once The Inn in the Forest is done.\nAbout the Creators\nDaniel J. Bishop (Author): Daniel started playing Dungeons & Dragons on Christmas Day 1979 with the Holmes Blue Box set and immediately fell in love. Encountering the Dungeon Crawl Classics rules brought back the kind of joy and energy that those early games had. His first published work for DCC was Bone Hoard of the Dancing Horror in 2012 and he's never looked back. Since then, Daniel has had over 40 adventures published for DCC, including Goodman Games\u2019 The Imperishable Sorceress, The Dread God Al-Khazadar, Through the Dragonwall, and DCC Lankmar's The Fence's Fortuitous Folly. He has also done official conversions of D&D 3E, D&D 4E, and XCrawl! materials for Goodman Games, but is perhaps best known as the author of The Arwich Grinder. Daniel's philosophy is that the decisions the players make should always matter. If there are consequences that live on long after the adventure is done, that's so much better! He lives in Toronto, Canada, where the maple syrup is plentiful and the gaming is fine.\nDaniel J. Bishop: then, now, and some of his many DCC contribution as an author\nShyloh Wideman (Project Manager, Editor, Layout): To support his gaming and guitar playing habits, Shyloh is co-owner and Chief Creative Officer of a software and web development company that primarily works with government and non-profit organizations to provide better service and support to the public. Back in 1980, at age 8, Shyloh bought the AD&D Player\u2019s Handbook, Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide, and Monster Manual and had his parents worry about him ever since. Moving almost yearly, Shyloh never had a gaming group in his youth but played the occasional D&D and Call of Cthulhu game once he entered college. It wasn\u2019t until 2007, when he reconnected with some old college friends, did he start gaming regularly. Shyloh fell into the DCC community accidentally in 2017 when he showed a map he drew to a friend, who then posted it to Google+, where Daniel picked it up and wrote his Thirteen Brides of Blood adventure based off it. This was published in the DCC zine, The Gongfarmer\u2019s Almanac, later that year. Shyloh soon became deeply involved in the GFA as a cartographer, editor, and layout artist, then also as one of the two lead admins for the 2019 and 2020 publication years. With his focus on community outreach and engagement, he helped grow the GFA from 8 volumes and 350 pages to 16 volumes and 800 pages, culminating in the release of over 30 zines in print and PDF formats, as well as annual compilations in hardcover, softcover, and PDF formats in that 2-year span. He has also provided cartography, artwork, editing, and editable character sheets for other DCC RPG-compatible publications, including Weird Frontiers RPG (formerly Dark Trails RPG) and Bronx Beasts.\nThe Gongfarmer's Almanac: some of the individual zines and compliations Shyloh helped produce\nBartek Kucharski (Lead Artist): Bartek first played RPGs back in the late 1990s, primarily Warhammer 2nd edition (where 15 friends had to share one rulebook between them), but also some Werewolf, Vampire Masquerade, and Call of Cthulhu. Unfortunately that all ended after a year when all their Warhammer characters died in a massive battle with chaos forces, people moved away, and new characters weren\u2019t near and dear to the heart. It actually took the pandemic and an RPG rabbit hole to bring Bartek back into gaming. Bored, jumping around YouTube to find a good DnD session, he saw a review of DCC, bought The Leech cover version of the core rulebook, and while waiting for it to ship from 2000km away (Bartek\u2019s in Poland), discovered The Gongfarmer\u2019s Almanac through a Spellburn podcast. He reached out to see if any art was needed for the 2020 release and was connected with Daniel Bishop, providing all the artwork for the original preview edition released in the GFA. Bartek has been drawing his whole life, tattooing professionally since 2009, and actively illustrating for the RPG industry since 2020, primarily providing cover art and interior illustrations for adventures and zines. After \u201ctattooing the same thing over and over,\u201d Bartek describes his game illustration work as a creative joy but also a creative challenge as, \u201cI think there is no drug strong enough to induce ideas presented in DCC.\u201d | Instagram\nartwork by Bartek Kucharski for Casket of Fays (Red Ruin Publishing) and Pirate Ports of Pestilence (a Four Against Darkness adventure by Erick Bouchard)\nAdditional Artists\nDepending on the stretch goals met, other artists will also be contributing.\nCarmin Vance | Instagram\nDiogo Nogueira | Gallery\nKarim Glue | Gallery\nDanny Prescott | DeviantArt\nDuamn Figueroa Rassol | Instagram\nDan Domme | Instagram", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a relatively small Kickstarter project, with writing, artwork, and layout currently underway by a team of established DCC content contributors, including an author with over 40 published DCC adventures (including ones for Goodman Games), a project manager who has helped produce over 30 DCC zines in the last two years, and a great set of artists who have created hundreds of pieces already for DCC and other RPG products.\n\nI will be using Mixam, known for their quality and consistency, for printing. I will fulfill all orders myself and will be sending zines out in a rigid, flat cardboard mailer.\n\nWith Covid-19 still around, shipping may take more time than normal and there is always the chance that someone may get sick. To address this:\n- we have backups for editing, layout, and distribution, an alternate local printer, and more than enough artists to handle any artwork or cartography that may need to be reassigned\n- we have added a month into the timeline to account for delays\n- we are doing concurrent work, giving all contributors extra time to complete their tasks without it affecting the overall project timeline\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nDurable covers and high quality inking make a product that will physically last.

The product itself is recyclable.\nSustainable materials\nPrinting is done on recycled paper using vegetable based inks. Packaging is recyclable.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe work with print shops that use recycled paper and vegetable based inks, and also recycle waste products.\nSustainable Distribution\nThis product is made in the USA.

Some might be cool and powerful weapons, but most just make for entertaining problem solving and creative utility.\nExample Dungeon Room. Bold is for obvious stuff, ready to read aloud.

The game is inspired by Paladium's \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness\" RPG, published in 1985, but uses the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC RPG) rule system for quick and easy gameplay. \nWho am I?\nI've enjoyed tabletop RPG's since getting the Frank Metzner (\"red box\") edition of Basic Dungeons & Dragons in 1983 at the tender age of 8 years old.  I've enjoyed gaming in the decades since, and after discovering DCC RPG in 2016 and attending Gary Con IX in 2017, I was inspired to write and design games rather than just play them.\nThe author and his Jr. High School chums gaming at Gary Gygax\u2019s house, Lake Geneva 2017\nI released the Bronx Beasts Volume 1 zine in time to hand out copies to a lucky few at Gary Con XI in 2019 with all sorts of great ideas for adventures and crazy random tables to fuel adventures in the worlds of Bronx Beasts yet to come.  Volume 1 contains all the game rules needed for creating Beast class player characters and new game play mechanics, including Evolution Points, Bestial Freakouts, and Fur Burn, and is fully compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game (DCC RPG).   I also released a zero-level funnel adventure called \"The Handoff\" for Bronx Beasts in the 2019 volume of the Gongfarmer's Almanac, a free unofficial zine for DCC RPG. \nSince then, I've been writing and testing additional adventure material for Bronx Beasts, and have explored other adventure settings for Beasts to roam beyond my original vision of a fictionalized mid-1980's New York City with the \"Ninja\" knob cranked up to 11. \nWhat are these Zines About?\nThis Kickstarter is to fund no less than 8 volumes of Bronx Beasts zines, which will be available in digital and print format.  \nBronx Beasts Volume 1 is already complete but needs to be reprinted, as I only have about 30 copies left from the first printing.  I plan to fix the one typo that I'm aware of in that volume, but otherwise make no changes.  This volume is 44 pages long, and this is the first time it is available in a digital format.\nBronx Beasts Volume 1 Cover and Table of Contents, artwork by Clayton Williams\nBronx Beasts Volumes 2 - 5 comprise a four-part campaign built around an 1980's-era story chock full of mutated animals, ninjas, leg warmers, glowing goo, bare-chested commandos, and every other '80's trope I could think to include.  The adventures follow a group of Beasts from 1st through 4th level as they uncover the mystery of their own origins as well as take on the shadowy organizations responsible for a deadly new drug that is flooding the streets of the Big Apple.  The campaign takes up 4 separate zine volumes, split up into individual adventures in a \"point crawl\" style campaign across, below, and above the City that Never Sleeps.   Additional setting material, random encounters, and villainous personalities are included to encourage exciting adventures and story development between the campaign's main plot points.\nThe Big Bop Back to Brooklyn is a stand-alone adventure for Bronx Beasts in a single zine volume.  More than one player of my Bronx Beasts games have enthusiastically told me they would love to see a Bronx Beasts adventure based on the 1979 film \"The Warriors.\"  I decided to take on this challenge, and dozen screenings of the film, a couple of readings through the original novel, and a few play tests has resulted in an adventure that I feel captures the essence of this story into a great adventure, dropping Beasts into the roles of street gangs on a hot New York City summer night.\nThe Island of Lost Souls is my riff on H.G. Well's \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" with a nod to director Richard Stanley's vision for the doomed 1996 film of the same name. These zines provide information about the Island in a sandbox campaign setting and provides a series of adventures following the Beasts living on the Island.  Random tables, monsters, encounters, and a full map of the Island and its key locations are provided to encourage as much use out of this sandbox as possible.\nAll volumes are expected to be between 32 and 48 pages long, and print copies will be black and white with cardstock covers.  Shipping for US backers is already included in the cost for all pledge levels that involve printed copies.  Printed copies will be  shipped out as soon as they're available, with PDF copies being made available 2 weeks prior to the physical zine releases.\nMore images from Volume 1, artwork by Erik Breese & Dan Steeby", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have experience with desktop publishing and game design, and have published similar material before, having released Bronx Beasts Volume 1 and \"The Handoff\" Adventure in 2019. I have also worked on the Gongfarmer's Almanac, a free unofficial zine for the DCC RPG since 2017 in various roles, including handling writing, editing, and layout duties for that publication.\n\nBronx Beasts Volume 1 is complete and there is virtually no risk for backing this item, I just need to reprint it as I've only got about 30 copies left from my 1st print run. This volume will be available to backers in March 2021.\n\nThe material for the other zines in this Kickstarter campaign is new, but is already written and some of it is already in desktop publishing software, just waiting for artwork. Other volumes will still require some organizing and final play testing, which I'll be doing at game conventions and in private play tests throughout 2021. There is little risk for any of this as far as the writing work goes as I consider everything I'm putting out to be at least 80% written at this time. I've put the most 'ready for release' items first in the release schedule, with The Island of Lost Souls Volumes 1 and 2 scheduled for completion in August 2021, The Big Bop Back to Brooklyn scheduled for October 2021, and Bronx Beasts Volumes 2 - 5 scheduled for February 2022.\n\nMy main risk is coordinating with and funding the artists that will be involved in making original artwork for these zines. Pricing for artwork that I've gotten estimates from so far range between $30 and $50 per piece, with larger pieces such as covers costing more.

The album's title, title song, and intro are clearly nods to a certain famous scene in the film.  It was not until years later that I actually watched the film, but when I finally got around to it, it made an impression on me nearly as strong as my 10-year-old self had been impressed by the face makeup and searing vocals of Dee Snider.  The comic book-esque introduction and scene changes combined with the outlandish gangs in the dirty, garish backdrop of New York City provided visual imagery that presented a different take on gang life and New York.  Watching it immediately called to my mind the colorful 'first wave' of NYC hip hop artists in the vein of the Furious Five, Sugar Hill Gang, Zulu Nation, and Public Enemy.  The movie was about walking the streets and skin rumbles, which was a very different take than the NYC that I grew up seeing in action films from the '80's and '90's, as cinematic crime had evolved from fistfights in the park to drive-by shootings and portrayed nearly every citizen armed to the teeth."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "A Closer Look at The Big Bop Back to Brooklyn", "update_content": "Here's a closer look at the two zine volumes that I'm working on for the Island of Lost Souls sandbox campaign setting and some background on my interest on this setting."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "A Closer Look at the Island of Lost Souls", "update_content": "Thanks everyone for your support on my project!

The locations are not connected to one another and can be sprinkled onto your campaign map however you like, or run as one shots. The zine is graphic and art heavy and utilizes a lot of random tables and other tools to make it easier for GMs to run in a pinch.\nEach hex location has its own tone and scenario and they are not related to each other. They each are complete with hooks for your players, timelines of events to keep the pace of the game moving, as well as unique monsters and NPCs. The hexes are designed to be low-prep to run with a focus on what information is needed at the table.\nThe Haunted Hamlet\nExample Hex : The Hat Cult's Hideout\nThree weeks ago, an apprentice stole a powerful fusion device and a number of magical hats from a wizard he was studying under. He brought the device to an abandoned cave in a wood, frustrated that the wizard never used the device. He began combining random animals he found out of curiosity, thinking they probably prefer to be fused. Who wants to be just one thing anyway? He recruited some others from a local town who were interested to come live in the cave to learn magic and together they formed the hat cult. \nEach new member receives one of the magical hats upon initiation. There are now 10 members, and with endless curiosity they combine different creatures in the device. Seeing themselves as visionaries at ground zero, ushering in a new age were people will finally be satisfied and complete as fusion beings. Nothing excites the members more than ideas of new combinations, while the creatures they have already created are set loose in the woods and quickly forgotten about. It seems each creation is a bit of a disappointment to the cult once its created, not as exciting as the initial idea was. This frenzied cycle has been continuing for weeks. Dangerous creatures are now leaking out of the woods and into surrounding villages, causing all kinds of problems. \nThe Hat Cult's Hideout Hex Contains: \nA Timeline of events \nHooks for your players \nA magical creature generator \nA map of the Hat cult's Hideout \nStats for the Cultists \nPrompts and resolutions for what happens if players take different actions \nA \"whats currently going on?\" table \nA list of magical head wear\nArtwork\nAll four hexes will contain stats compatible with the old school essentials rule system.\nTrim size : 5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d\n100 gsm paper stapled with 110 gsm cardstock cover\nBlack & White\nPrinted with Mixam\n28 + pages\nThe PDF will have hyperlinks and bookmarks\nPledge for two zines and you will receive my previous zinequest project - Willow\nWillow is a grim backwater town that can be dropped into your campaign.

It details 13 individual areas, but plays as a tense, fast-paced encounter with multiple moving parts as the party inevitably splits up. It will take 1.5-2 hours for your players to complete. \nWide-eyed Terror takes place at a semi-isolated farmstead which can be placed right off of a road between towns, or can simply be stumbled upon as part of a hex crawl. It can also be used as an alternate set-up to The Precipice of Corruption, or to continue that adventure.\nWriting and Art Credits:\nMost of the writing was done by myself, Nick Baran. This time Jamie Jordan and myself will be handling all of the art and cartography duties. Find Jamie Jordan @noirfade on Instagram.\nZine Stats: This zine is slated to be 20-24 pages, saddle stitched. The interior will be black and white on 60# text and the cover will be black on colored 65# cover stock. This zine will be printed at DigiCopy, here in Milwaukee, WI.\nThe Goal:\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to raise the funds to print 100 copies of this 20-24 page zine.

So you're going to find that just about everything we have in here fits that mold.

Magic and Shit is a cover-to-cover 48-page, saddle-stitched, 5.5-inch by 8.5-inch B&W printed zine with a bad ass color cover by Planet X favorite (and consumate, lifelong metalhead) Lawrence Hernandez. Like all of our zines, this poser-free fanzine is stacked with a ton of new plug-n-play content that you can drop directly into your fantasy role playing games. No rambling charts or useless page-filler to suck up space - just our usual grindhouse-style content infused with some denim and leather love for the 70s-80s metal scene.\nCovert art for Magic and Shit by Lawrence Hernandez\nThe magical items in this zine have been designed to bring something a little weird and altogether new to your campaign, while still giving a knowing nod to the games of yore that we all love and remember so fondly. What will your players do when confronted with the Mummified Hand of Gilly Yonder? Dare they slip on the Graveshroud of Nanthos the Black? What the hell is a Corpsehatch Seed? Dare they summon the dread powers of the Moaning Head of St Barach?\nThis zine is full of surprises and all-new takes on magical treasures to keep your players guessing. Will they partake of the Blood of the Bol-Gatha and harness the power of the Faceless One? Will they read aloud the Screed of Black Lore and gain the powers of darkness for themselves? Perhaps a villain is in possession of the Ossuary of Yeth and its only a matter of time before the players find themselves at the mercy of howling demons from the great beyond? With options galore, there's a hundred ways to make this zine a staple at your tabletop game. \nThe High-Flyin' Jawbone of Cutter Wotts and the Ossuary of Yeth by Adrian Landeros\nSO WHAT'S IN THIS DAMN OLE THING ANYWAYS?\nMagic and Shit contains 30+ magical items and artifacts that are fully detailed and ready to play at your table. This isn't one of those books where you get a couple of lines about statistics and then we move on - we're giving you full descriptions, a little history and a plug-n-play plot hook for every entry, along with killer art by Planet X favorites like Adrian Landeros and Lawrence Hernandez.\nThe cliche \"don't judge a book by its cover\" doesn't apply to Magic and Shit, because what you see is absolutely what you get! The entire zine has a feel and aesthetic that is directly influenced from our favorite metal albums. When pitching this project, we wanted it to have the same feel as popping the shrink on a newly purchased copy of Metallica's Master of Puppets or Black Sabbath's Master of Reality, with no guess as to what might actually be inside aside from pure badassery. Magic and Shit was directly inspired by our love of heavy metal albums from the 70s and 80s. We're channeling Iron Maiden's Powerslave, Cannibal Corpse's Butchered at Birth and Judas Priest's Screaming for Vengeance. We're disciples at the altar of legendary cover artists like Doug Johnson, Derek Riggs, Pushead, Joe Petagno, Vincent Locke and Ed Repka. Eddie, Snaggletooth and Vic Rattlehead are our co-pilots!\nThe Mummified Hand of Gilly Yonder by Adrian Landeros\nTHE TEAM\nMagic and Shit is written by lifelong metalhead Levi Combs, who has published a number of adventure modules through Planet X Games. He has also been a writer on several projects for FGG, Necromancer Games and Mudpuppy Games. You can find him at @it_came_from_beyond_planet_x on Instagram.\nAdrian Landeros is an uber-talented illustrator who has done work for a variety of game publishers including FGG, Necromancer Games and Planet X Games. His full color covers and beautiful black and white interiors are equally impressive, but his interior illustrations for Magic and Shit capture the aesthetic and vibe of the zine perfectly. You can find him at @ghoster9 on Instagram.\nThe Assassin\u2019s Sash and Blasphemous Eidolon of the Outer Gods by Adrian Landeros\nTracey Steele is the unsung layout and design hero of Planet X Games, since she's the one that makes all these books look so great in the first place. Its been a real pleasure to work with her over so many projects and she brings an enthusiasm and work ethic to these projects that is unmatched. You can find her at @fossiedesign on Instagram.\nJe Shields is a freelance illustrator with credits in the RPG industry that reads like a what's what of bad ass projects. His Patreon is one of the best I have ever seen and you can find him at @j_e_shields on Instagram.\nLawrence Hernandez is one of the most imaginative artists I've ever met. He has done illustrations for almost all of the releases from Planet X Games, in addition to numerous artistic projects of his own. He's back with the glorious cover to this zine, along with a handful of interior illustrations. You can find him at @lawrence_hernandez_arts on Instagram.\nThe Graveshroud of Nanthos the Black by Adrian Landeros\nHOW TO PLEDGE FOR MULTIPLE COPIES\nIf a single copy won't do it for you or you need to order for a friend, we've got options for getting multiple copies of the Magic and Shit zine. No need to bargain your soul to blasphemous elder entities - just select the pledge level for the PRINT + PDF and fill out the dollar amount in multiples of $15 (i.e., $30 for two copies, $45 for three copies, etc).\nRETAILER PLEDGE LEVEL\nOne of the things Planet X Games has always been proud of is our support for the FLGS - those brick and mortar Friendly Local Game Stores. In these strange times we've found ourselves in, we need them more than ever. If you are a retailer, this is the pledge level for you!\nSHIPPING\nEach and every Magic and Shit zine will be carefully packaged and shipped to backers via USPS in a non-bendable carboard envelope with multiple \u201dDO NOT BEND\u201d stickers. Kickstarter has recommended that all shipping and handling costs should NOT be included in your pledge levels. Shipping and handling is $5 and add-ons come at an extra $2 each. If i can get it cheaper for you, I will. Retailer shipping comes via media mail and is also only $5.\nALL SHIPPING FOR PRINT ZINES IS FOR THE UNITED STATES ONLY, so please make your pledges accordingly. Current international shipping costs are so ridiculously high and unreasonable that it is simply not feasible for Planet X Games at this time. Its unfortunate and we're not happy about it, but larger companies than us have tried and failed, despite the resources at their disposal. There's something about shipping a $15 book for $32 that just sticks in our craw. We just can't get behind that and can only offer up apologies with hopes that shipping costs will become more manageable in the future.\nBloodyguts\u2019 Bone Rattle and Corpsehatch Seeds by Adrian Landeros\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe're doing a little something different this time - instead of putting in a ton of stretch goals, we're just gonna go ahead and have faith in the Doom-Gods of the Wild Hinterlands and blow the zine out to it's 48 page maximum. The entirety of the funds raised by this project are going straight back into the book in order to get you the kind of off-brand, indie content you've come to expect from Planet X Games.\nADD-ONS\nDid you miss out on any of our previous projects? No worries - we've got you covered! Add-ons will be available in Backerkit, so youre good to go!\nJungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride ($21 backer-only price)\nTales of the cursed pyramid and the sleeping tomb of the Mummy Bride have long been a traveler\u2019s tale, passed along by wayward explorers and greedy plunderers alike. Deep within the verdant jungles of the south, amidst a Green Hell of impenetrable jungle, savage cannibals and ancient myth, lies the shattered remnants of a once-powerful civilization and the terrible gods who ruled over them. Rumors swirl of untold riches and un-plundered magic for those brave (or foolish!) enough to claim it. Will your players survive\u2026 and what will be left of them? Jungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride is a 5E adventure module suitable for levels 5-7.\nAn Occurrence at Howling Crater ($29 backer-only price)\nBrutal tales of the desolate, unforgiving wasteland known as Howling Crater have long caused travelers and caravan masters to give it a wide berth, but now fresh accounts of depravity and madness have begun to circulate out of that forbidden wasteland. Deep within the barren recesses of the crater, a murderous family of inbred, mutated crater folk have begun to preach the gospel of the \"the glory of the glow\" and with it has come incurable sickness and murderous incursions across the land. Even stranger rumors have made the rounds as of late, whispering of a long-forgotten civilization of steel and fire, born in a swirling inferno of radioactive dust and powered by ancient alien astronaut-gods, lost deep within the crater's recesses.\nCan your characters fight their way past this mutated, maniacal cult of alien-worshipping hillbillies to explore the truth of Howling Crater? Do they dare penetrate the inner mysteries of an ancient crashed ship and put a stop to the biological terrors that now run loose? Will they discover the true, terrifying secret behind the horrible happenings at Howling Crater?!\nAn Occurrence at Howling Crater is a 5E adventure module suitable for levels 7-9.\nEscape from Skullcano Island ($47 backer-only price)\nOminous signs have been sweeping across the land. Forbidding skies stained the color of blood. Thunderous, bestial sounds roaring from across the sea. Natural disasters of all varieties are raging uncontrollably across the land. Through it all, rumors swirl of strangely-clad heretics and wild-eyed blasphemers running amok, whispering prophecies of annihilation. What is happening\u2026 and why?\nLearned folk of every race have assembled with the most renowned oracles and seers of our age in an effort to discover what is truly happening. They all point to one place as the source of their collective woe \u2013 the primeval jungles and untouched shores of the legendary Skullcano Island!\nEscape from Skullcano Island is a hardback 5E adventure module suitable for levels 15-20.\nGlimmering Crypt of the Ioun King ($21 backer-only price)\nTavern tales and campfire talk across the land whisper of a glittering, gem-laden tomb deep beneath the sunlit lands of the surface, the final resting place of a doomed dwarven wizard who delved deep into the heart of the earth seeking answers\u2026 but found something else.  Something went awry deep within those cyclopean vaults far beneath the surface, unleashing something that wasn't meant for the mortal world. What happened to this famed dwarven wizard... and does danger still lurk in the Glimmering Crypt of the Ioun King?\nGlimmering Crypt of the Ioun King is a 5E adventure module suitable for level 5-7.\nThe Phylactery zine No. 1 ($10 backer-only price)\nThe Phylactery is a cover-to-cover 48-page, saddle-stitched, 5.5-inch by 8.5-inch B&W printed zine with a bad ass color cover by Planet X favorite Ed Bickford. This booklet is jam packed with page after page of heroic fantasy adventure influenced heavily by early third party RPG badassery like Dave Hargrave\u2019s infamous  Arduin Grimoire series and the early Dragontree Press stuff. The Phylactery is meant to be a quick and easy resource that you can pull ideas and plot hooks from for use directly at your gaming table. There\u2019s no fluff in here and nothing padding out the page count - just pure old school goodness created exclusively for the fantasy gaming community. We have absolutely JAM-PACKED a ton of OSR goodness in here for you.\nThe Phylactery zine No. 2 ($10 backer-only price)\nThere was such an amazing reception to the first issue of The Phylactery that the creative team here at Planet X Games put together a sequel and this one is bigger, badder and louder in every respect, with the same heart and feel of the old school heroic fantasy RPGs we grew up playing back in the day. This is plug-n-play gaming at its best and the resources you find in these pages can be put directly to use in your home games. The Phylactery 2 is a cover-to-cover 48-page, saddle-stitched, 5.5-inch by 8.5-inch B&W printed zine with a full color cover by DC/Wildstorm comics artist Tony Avina and is packed full of OSR resources for your home table.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs it currently stands, this project is 100% written.

Joseph Goodman and his design team took the classic role playing game, stripped it down, and injected all the pure awesomeness of the Appendix N writings, and produced a glorious tome of RPG excellence that explodes with flavor and high octane attitude. DCC RPG is filled with luck pushing mechanisms that reward creative play while continually fueling spin off adventures that add to the narrative in amazingly fun play!\nMutant Crawl Classics (MCC) is technology & mutant role-playing game also published by Goodman Games. MCC returns players to the early days of sci-fi role-playing and pays homage to Gamma World & Metamorphosis Alpha. The system draws on the innovations that make DCC so popular, including Luck and random effects tables, but offers new races, classes, and artificially intelligent machines and patrons in a post-apocalyptic setting!\nFind out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics and Mutant Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\n\nWhat is Old-School Essentials?\nA stunningly beautiful retro-clone of Basic in a modular set, restructured, and set up for optimal use while you play the game!

It is a revision and compilation of six supplements produced by thirdkingom games, woven together into a single book of roughly two hundred pages and with integrated mechanics. It is designed to be used in conjunction with the book Filling in the Blanks, and is written with higher level play in mind; as the PCs leave the dungeons behind and stride out into the wilderness, intent on exploration and eventually carving out domains of their own to rule.\nHexcrawl Basics\nRandom Weather Generation\nDomain Building\nNPC Wealth by Level\nClassing up the Joint\nOSR Alternative classes\nBecause this is a compilation of existing works, and because many backers may have purchased some of them, I have kept the price of the pdf pledge low. Since none of them are available in print, and individually are relatively short, this allows them to be printed more economically as a whole book.\nAn advance -- unformatted and unedited -- version of Into the Wild can be found here to download.\nHere are some reviews of the above products:\nHexcrawl Basics:\nThese Old Games\nRPGPunk\nDirectory Gold\nDomain Building:\nRPGPunk\nDaddy Rolled a 1\nI'm going to be running this Kickstarter slightly differently than Filling in the Blanks. The text has already been written and revised, so the three main things this Kickstarter will fund are:\nCopy editing. Brian Johnson, who has been doing an excellent job editing all my works, has signed on to edit this and I have alerted him as to my schedule.\nArt. My goal is to have the art be all commissioned pieces with no stock art. I have reached out to a handful of artists to let them know about the project and to make sure I can get on their schedule. At this point my art goals are: cover, chapter, and roughly one piece of additional art for every 25 pages. I'm also going to commission two stronghold and two town maps.\nLayout. BJ Hensley is onboard to do the layout for this project, as she has been doing all my other works.\nI haven't done copy editing yet because, instead of having stretch goals for additional products, I intend to have all the stretch goals related to this book, and will potentially be adding a few pages of text. I don't anticipate any major changes or additions -- I've got everything where I want it to be -- but didn't want to jump the gun on editing if a chance for additions existed.\nIn addition to revising the documents listed above -- all of which are available on Drivethru -- I've added about fifty pages of new content, including:\nRevised encounter tables designed to create lairs, not just generate wandering monster results.\nExpanded rules for hunting, foraging, traveling in large parties, and otherwise surviving in the wilderness.\nSpecific rural and urban improvements that can be purchased to gain game benefits.\nBoon and friction results for domain managements.\nA mass combat system designed to provide a simple, playable minigame using a hex map.\nRules for buying and selling goods, including magical items.\nCost of Living tables to determine roughly how much a character of a given level should make or cost to hire.\nPatreon backers have been receiving sneak peaks of the book as I've been editing. I've estimated that shipping costs in the US will average about 5.00 for standard shipping and 15.00 for premium shipping. At an estimated length of 225 pages it looks like printing costs will be roughly 13.50 for standard color softcover and 18.00 for standard color hardcover. These costs are in addition to the pledge levels. Backers will receive codes for the at-cost print versions.\nThe stretch goals are as follows:\n3,000.00. \nThe book will contain two stronghold and two town maps as part of the original funding goal. If we reach 3,000.00 I'll commission three more each. These will be partially labeled maps that can be used at the table.\n6,000.00.\nMore art. I'll commission more art. The goal is to have roughly one illustration for every 20 pages.\n9,000.00.\nCustom sheets for use in tracking domains, hexes, strongholds, and urban centers. These will be similar to character sheets. There will be four sheets in total: city, domain, hex, and stronghold. These can be used to track relevant details for each location.\n12,000.00\nMore art. I'll commision more art. The goal is to have roughly one illustration every twelve pages.\n15,000.00\nI will commission unit chits to be illustrated for use with the mass combat rules presented in the book. I estimate there will be roughly 2-3 pages of these that can be printed and cut out for use on the battlemap of your choice.\n18,000.00\nMore art. The goal is to have roughly one illustration every six pages.\n20,000.00\nIf we somehow manage to hit this goal I will commission BJ to convert the custom town, stronghold, hex, and domain sheets to form-fillable pdfs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilling in the Blanks was my first Kickstarter and there were some issues, mostly with fulfillment, and those largely because I didn't know what I was doing. I will be changing some things up this time; mostly by waiting to release the pdfs and print codes at the same time. Like last time, everything is already written, and all of the stretch goals have little to no impact on the text of the book.

You are a group of small town high school misfits, lifelong friends  from the town of Crater Valley.  You've spent your whole life chafing at  the shackles of this town and you can't wait to get out.  Tonight is  your last Halloween before you head off to join the rat race and you and  your friends plan to make it one to remember.  Everyone has arrived,  except Julie- the class sweetheart who seems to be able to make friends  with anybody.  She should be here by now, she just lives at the end of the block.  You  are just about ready to leave without her when suddenly from the  direction of her house you hear the sound of breaking glass and Julie's  voice cry out into the night \"Somebody HELP MEEE! PLEEEEEAASE!\". \n\nBefore  you can even process what's just happened all of the lights in town go out simultaneously and the air is filled with the loud barks and growls  of what sounds like every dog in town braying in unison.  Will you  unlock the dark secrets of Crater Valley's history and rescue Julie from a force beyond death?\nthe teens will have to smart if they want to live to see another sunrise..\n\nWhat is this anyway?\nBlackout in Crater Valley is a '0 level funnel' which means players will create between 2 and 4 low level characters and try to survive the perils that await them as they attempt to rescue their friend Julie.  As they unlock the mysteries of Crater Valley they will encounter opportunities to advance in power significantly, however they will soon learn that great power often comes at a price...\nnothing is as it seems in this small town\nThis adventure has been designed to feel consistent with horror films of the 1980's such as A Nightmare on Elm Street, Return of the Living Dead, Sleep Away Camp, Pumpkinhead, and classic VHS era adventures like The Goonies and Back to the Future.  Character creation also plays heavily on tropes common in these and other teen drama films of the era such as \"Jock\", \"Cheerleader\", \"Goth\", \"Young Republican\" and \"Juvenile Delinquent\".  Players will roll archetypes like these from a unique d50 table of possible occupations and throw their teenage misfits against the dangers that await them. Once they've selected their archetype players will roll on an entanglement chart to help build party cohesion and create threads for a game master to build upon.  This game is designed to be played out over one or two sessions, but can easily be expanded for campaign play.\nPlayers can create a myriad of teenage misfits using this unique character generation system\nWhat is DCC?\nBLACKOUT in Crater Valley is a 3rd party adventure for the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG system.  DCCRPG is an Old School role playing game that combines the rules light approach of early iterations of the world's most famous role playing game with the high adventure, sword and sorcery vibe of appendix n classics and the gonzo influences of Heavy Metal and psychedelia. The \"0 level funnel\" is a unique and much loved feature of the DCC system where players make up 4 very low power characters and throw them at the various perils of an rpg adventure, many will die but those that survive live on as heroes! Though BLACKOUT in Crater Valley casts teenagers in the role of 0 level characters in a DCC funnel, this adventure can be easily adapted to any other Old School RPG system with relative ease.\nThe Art\nAs the adventure itself is written and complete, the primary goal of this campaign is to raise money for art and layout.  BLACKOUT in Crater Valley will be jam packed with amazing artwork and already features some truly amazing pieces by... \nPastor Gunderson by Pontus Bjorlin\nPontus Bjorlin : Stockholm based genius artist/writer/designer of ALTNYC88 and the forthcoming Fantastik Fiktion roleplaying system.  Find his work here: https://www.etsy.com/se-en/shop/Hornhand\nLuke the Drifter by Eric Radey\nEric Radey: Bay area based creator of the Dungeon Degenerates: Hand of Doom board game.  Find him on instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/ericradiation/\nDog King by Johannes Stahl\nJohannes Stahl : Nuremberg based artist and creator of the Travel Journal zines, check out his work here: http://www.johannesstahl.com/\nOf course there's a chainsaw by Simon Underwood\nSimon Underwood : AKA Lizardbrain Art, Simon is a Portland, OR based fantasy artist.  Follow him here: https://www.instagram.com/lizardbrain_art/\n\nthe Author will probably add a few of his own scribbles to this esteemed list.\nTimeline\nAs mentioned above the adventure is complete and has been playtested extensively, so we can cross that off of the list of potential x factors that could delay delivery of a finished product.  Roughly 30% of the art is complete and the cover is in production already so the author is very confident that this will not be a project that gets hung up for months on end with a claim that we are still waiting on art.  This book will be printed at Mixam and barring any unforeseen acts of fate should be in the hands of backers this summer, with PDF copies available by June and physical copies later in the summer.    \nBully by Eric Radey\nStretch Goals\nNot to give too much away, but we have some very cool stretch goals in the works!  such as a....\nStretch 1) Removable Poster Map at $3300-UNLOCKED!: This will be included in every copy of BLACKOUT for all backers!\nStretch 2) Original Soundtrack on MP3 and Limited Cassette at $3800-UNLOCKED!: The digital soundtrack will be free to download for every backer and  the limited audio cassette will be available as an additional purchase  through a pledge manager at the end of the campaign.\nStretch 3) Dog King T-Shirt at $4400-UNLOCKED!: I'll print up Johannes Stahl's amazing Dog King design  on both black  and white t shirts that will also be available as an additional purchase  through a pledge manager at the end of campaign.  The Soundtrack will be performed by:\n Eric Radey\nSPEEDWAY of Suitors Club Records http://suitorsclub.com/speedway.html \nand\nMembers of SPECTRES  https://spectresvancouver.bandcamp.com/\nStretch 4) BIGGER, BETTER, BLACKOUT! $5000-UNLOCKED!: I will upgrade the print quality of this module for every  backer, taking it from 'zine' to 'book', embiggening it to 8.5 x 11  size, 100lb paper weight and perfect binding!\nStretch 5) Bonus Zine and Character Sheets $6000-UNLOCKED!: At this financial milestone every BLACKOUT backer will receive a supplemental folder which will contain custom character sheets and a bonus zine of visual aids to share with players illustrating key events within the adventure.  Spoiler alert: it's a bloodstained journal featuring critical clues to unlocking the secrets of THE MASK.\nStretch 6) Digital Assets for VTT $7000: Should we do the unthinkable and achieve this absurd funding goal every backer will receive digital assets to be used with the virtual table top of your choice!  \nIf we make it beyond that....who knows?! More t-shirt designs? Custom  80's pastel Dice?  BLACKOUT in Crater Valley the motion picture?  Time  will tell!\n\nwhat horrors does The Mask have in store for our teenage heroes?

Sky-Lasher the Everlasting, Trident of the Sun goes to great lengths to make sure the walls fall as it approaches, as it drinks of humanity\u2019s riches.\nPay attention, if you see these things.. The Bat is on its way.\u201d \u2014 The Infinite Reach of the Bat God\nSatelli-Bat Drone by Chin Fong\nWhat is Terror of the Stratosfiend?\nPortals and warp gates have been opening all over the earth, giant aliens have been pouring out, and Bat Gods are rampaging. Players will quickly find out that some of their own have been aliens the whole time, and that humans from distant stars have also shown up to help quell the madness. The works as an add-on to any DCC (Dungeon Crawl Classics) session the Judge and players would be running; adding a splash of tentacles. It's also being built to be a standalone setting where tentacles and sorcery would be the focus.\nBut wait this is issue #3?\nYES, YES it is.\nThis focuses on the arrival of the Weapons Satellite turned Demon Bat God, Sky-Lasher the Everlasting, Trident of the sun. The orbital weapons platforms are mid bombardment and humanity has taken to the skies to persist. Flight is a big component of this book, but so are the mysterious drop-engines and the demons they summon.\nAs a player you\u2019ll be riding pteranodons and bladed seals. Exhuming warships from a sea of blood. Conjuring terrifying drop-magic and binding demons. Or perhaps you\u2019ll be configuring your satellite prayers to the Enamel-Cortex, the Flesh Architect\u2026\nAs a Judge you\u2019ll be hurling out Generator-Demons from the drop, strange fishermen from the sea of blood, and activating double-agents loyal to the bat alone. From the skies will fall the Orbital Satelli-cults, the Satelli-rail cavalry, and the terrifying Wings of the Bat\u2019s Navy.\nWhat choices will you make? Will you take to the seas, or spread your wings and embrace the boons of the Bat-God? Will you cast spells that fuse armor to flesh or will you mend what\u2019s broken. It\u2019s up to you to navigate this incursion.\nCover Art by Lluis Abadias\n\nWhat is Dungeon Crawl Classics?\nDungeon Crawl Classics is a roleplaying game designed and published by Goodman games. It's a combination of classic Appendix N (Conan, Solomon Kane, and other classic fantasy literature), alongside all the things you'd expect in other classic roleplaying games. It has a heavy emphasis on Sword and Sorcery, and you're just as likely to be casting spells and watching your body mutate, as you are to knock a cyclops off a cliff to dam a river.\nAnd even if you don\u2019t play (or own) DCC, it still has HD, and AC and stuff you\u2019d find in other OSR, and D20 systems!\nWhat is in Issue #3?\nNew Classes\n Half-Ogre Demon-Engine: they have come through the Drop to hunt the demons released from the gates, trapping them in their cybernetic heart phylacteries.\n Bonded Skulker Pteranodon Raider: a new DUAL class that provides both rider and mount advancement. oh, and the mounts get a variety of cool installs and upgrades.\n Satellibat Drone: Orbital Weapons platforms (pictured above) that may be possessed by the Bat-God itself.\n Stratosfiend Delver R-MORE: blood powered mechs from within the sea of blood. Piloted by Stratosfiend devout enough to burn out their own psionic cores.\nNew Occupations\n Skulker Occupations: do you trade in centipede bile? Or are you a gladiator?\n Pteranodon Occupations: do you trade in messages delivered or the bones of the fallen?\nNew Deeds\n Skulker Deeds: blinding flashes of light and a flurry of limbs used to stun opponents.\n Pteranodon Deeds: when you must tear your enemy with talon, and beak, and wing.\n Blood-Mech Deeds: swift attacks and brutal attacks. There\u2019s even a third table when both strike and a blood rage deed activates.\nNew Spells\n Drop Magic: ever wanted to open a small black hole to tap someone on the shoulder? Now you can\n Armor Magic: fuse armor into flesh.\nAnd more!\nPteranodon and her Rider by Marie Enger\nNew Items\n Wing Boards: for aerial assaults and really cool tricks\n Micro-Drop Grenades: detonation and pocket wormholes\nAnd more!\nNew Patron\n Enamel-Cortex, the Flesh Architect: the surgical god.

Complete with patron taint, spellburn, and new spells!\nNew Bestiary Entries\n Generator-Demons: a new classification of demon that infest electronics and cybernetics.\n New Mounts: Bladed Seals, Tusked Elephants, and Crystalline centipedes!\n War Mages: Devoted to the new kinds of magic. Drop and Armor.\n Satelli-Rail Cavalry: literal drop ships, that tunnel through space itself; flapping on wings of leather and bone.\n Satelli-Cultists: fierce loyalists to the Bat, suited in wing-suits and hyper-sonic scream cannons.\n Wings of the Bats Navy: 4 squadrons configured for support and assault. Full aerial superiority.\nAnd More!\nNew Tables\n Enticements of the Bat: when the Weapons Satellite must attract new followers.\n Double-Agents: those devoted to the Bat waiting for activation\n Things and People found in the Sea of Blood: what strange hulks and people are found in this sea...\nAnd More!\nSatelli-Cult and Satelli-Rail by James Everett Jackson\nThe Plan\nWe're releasing a 72 page, 5\" x 8\", staple-bound Zine for the DCC RPG.

Their mission: win freedom by acquiring a legendary religious relic at the behest of their corporate jailors, PrayCo. \nThe Wheel's hollow internal landscape of barren fields and rusting, bombed out structures swarm with monstrous bioengineered animals and lethal corporate relic hunters. Trenches, minefields, hull punctures and a stalemated battle bar passage from the high-gravity docking bays to the blasphemous prize waiting at the funnel's tip.\nSimple farmers of the rotating colony ship Within Wheels starve as bargain InstaCrops wither on the vine. They turn to faith and ritual, concocting visions of a hell on earth from half-remembered traditions and commercialized lore. Bunker doors seal as their beacon calls upon believers to consecrate synthetic soil with holy blood.\nThe Drain takes a WWI influenced war-as-hell meat grinder and mashes it with bleak, occult survival horror themes drawn from video games like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Darkwood. This 16-page zine is packed with everything you need to churn out a crop of battle hardened level-1 characters from level-0 rabble, including:\n Brand new rules for running carnage-filled funnels in Mothership.\n A funnel crawl map by Andrew Walter, gorgeously illuminated to chart the party's movement through the conical space.\n Vicious new items to arm your mob of funnel PCs.\n Art on every spread, including illustrations from Mothership creator Sean McCoy.\n\nThis module emulates Dungeon Crawl Classics\u2019 \"funnel\" character generation in which each player pilots multiple level-0 characters through a \"meat grinder\". Survivors, forged in blood, earn their 1st level. If embraced, a funnel becomes a contest to achieve the most spectacular PC death. Players and GMs bond in murderous collaboration, anxieties surrounding character death melting away. PCs become resources to throw at problems rather than precious things to be guarded. Campaign-spanning legends of heroic sacrifice and bitter survival begin here.\nAll backers will receive a 1-page PDF of my funnel rules for Mothership immediately after the campaign ends so you can get started running your own funnels. The rules sheet will include guidelines for creating your own funnel adventures and running existing modules as funnels.\nInterested in a writing sample from the author before you back? My first Mothership pamphlet and Gold DriveThruRPG bestseller Moonbase Blues is free for the duration of this Kickstarter. Snag it if you haven't already!\nhttps://ian-yusem.itch.io/moonbase-blues\nFunnel Survivor backers will receive a limited run double-sided A3 poster of Andrew Walter's map for The Drain. I will hand write custom, unique game content for each backer on the \"secret\" reverse side. Backers will submit a personal theme and work with me to customize Within Wheels for their home game. The content I write is up to each backer, and could vary from a gut-churning table to a terrifying new monster.\nPretty cool video, right? You could own all 3 unique, lovingly handcrafted spaceship models from the trailer to use as props in your game. Should you back at the Within Wheels pledge tier, you will receive: A 5\" x 3\" model of the ill-fated sleeve soldier dropship Genesis, a 12\" x 9\" model of the PrayCo prison transport Charity, and a 9\" x 4\" model of colony ship and adventure setting Within Wheels delivered right to your home (shipping included). The models were made with styrene foam, superglue, \"bits of junk\", blood, sweat, tears, and dreams. The proceeds for this pledge will go to Meredith, our steadfast video producer and master modeler.\nIan Yusem: Pamphlet baron and occasional RPG blogger, Ian (myself) is the author and publisher of The Drain. Mothership fans might recognize some of my 3rd party scenarios like Moonbase Blues and Dinoplex: Cataclysm. I think The Drain is my best work yet, and I'm excited to send it out into the world.\nChristian Kessler: The layout and design genius behind books like Silent Titans and Troika! Numinous Edition is putting his eminent talents behind this humble zine. Christian also illustrated the sweet, Russian constructivism-influenced cover art for The Drain. A man of many talents.\nFiona Maeve Geist: Editing powerhouse and RPG darling, Fiona has been essential to this project's development and she's done a wonderful job tightening up the manuscript. Fiona is a lead developer on Mothership and takes her pen to 99% of everything good in RPGs as part of the editing team MoonRat Conspiracy, including Ultraviolet Grasslands, Troika, Silent Titans, ad infinitum.\nAndrew Walter: Andrew made the best damn map I've ever seen in an RPG for this project. You used to know his illustrations from beloved titles like Troika, Slipgate Chokepoint and Fever Swamp\u2014now you know him from The Drain.\nSean McCoy: Last, but certainly not least, the design legend behind Mothership and co-owner of Tuesday Knight Games is contributing an absolute ton of fantastically horrifying art to this zine. Not a spread will go by without its splendor.\nThe Drain's manuscript is written, playtested, and edited. Christian is underway on final layout and the last pieces of art are rolling in from Sean. We're on track to fulfill well before our June estimate (which budgets an extra couple months for unseen complications). Here's a conservative timeline laying out our internal milestones:\nJanuary 2021 - Writing, playtesting, editing complete\nFebruary 2021 - Kickstarter campaign, PledgeManager opened to Backers\nMarch 2021 - All art submitted, layout and text finalized\nApril 2021 - Printed proofs ordered and reviewed\nMay 2021 - Print run ordered, stretch goals completed\nJune 2021 - Fulfillment begins\nThe good folks at Exalted Funeral will be fulfilling physical orders to the USA and the Rest of the World.\nThe Melsonian Arts Council is handling distribution to the United Kingdom and Europe.\nMonkey's Paw Games has Canada covered.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge, but will be collected at the time of release via PledgeManager to ensure accurate shipping costs. Digital copies of the zine will be distributed through DriveThruRPG.\nRecent changes to tax policy due to Brexit complicates EU and UK distribution, on top of ongoing Covid shipping troubles. While to the best of our knowledge this campaign should avoid tax complications from Brexit, you may be liable for VAT, duties, or fees depending upon your country of residence.

Final layout is well underway, the remaining art pieces are steadily rolling in, and stretch goals have been thoroughly planned out. All digital goals will be fulfilled separately from the zine and delivered as they're completed to avoid any delays on the main project. Additional physical rewards beyond the zine are uncomplicated to produce and are ready to go if funded.\n\nShipping is certainly a challenge, but you're in good hands.

This updated 5E version includes new player options, an updated Worldbook with all-new chapters, and a fantastical city book to launch a memorable campaign\u2014and a caravan's weight in short- and medium-length adventures. The Southlands setting is fully compatible with the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s first RPG.\nWelcome friend! Come and adventure with us here.\nThe project will create more than a dozen main rewards covering 4 major formats with two partner companies:\nA hardcover Southlands Worldbook in both regular and limited editions, described in this Table of Contents preview \nA hand-tooled, rich leather edition of the Worldbook, \nA hardcover City of Cats, a home base containing many adventures,\nA softcover Southlands Player's Guide of heroic options, subclasses, and races, described in this preview and developer's diary \nThe fully-optimized PDFs for all of the above,\n Digital Roll20 editions of the Southlands Worldbook, City of Cats, and Player's Guide for that virtual tabletop (VTT), published by our partners at Roll20, and\nThe Fantasy Grounds editions of the Southlands Worldbook, City of Cats, and the Player's Guide for that VTT platform, published by our partners at Smiteworks.\nKobold Press will also produce the Kickstarter-exclusive hardcover edition of Tales Beneath the Sands, a collection of adventures by Jerry LeNeave (preview).\nSpecial Editions\nThe limited edition will be printed once with a leatherette, foil-stamped cover, ribbon bookmark, special endpapers, and similar touches. The content is identical to the regular edition, but this deluxe, limited edition often becomes extremely sought after.\nThis project does also offer a handbound leather edition for collectors and bibliophiles. This is done entirely in the traditional style of bookbinding, with excellent leather (possibly deep green or sky blue) stamped with gold foil and embellished with corded spine, ribbon bookmarks, and other flourishes. This is limited to roughly a dozen copies and is not available after the Kickstarter. Because of the extra time needed to create it, this reward ships about a month after the other reward packages do.\nBundles\nYou can get the Southlands materials separately or in bundles of 3 items, and the bundles offer a discount. In addition, the limited edition is available only though the Kickstarter, not through later elements such as a survey or pledge manager. (Sometimes we have a few extra limited editions for sale in the Kobold Store\u2014that's never guaranteed!).\n Bonus Goals & Level Up Items \nUp to 10 of the PDF rewards for backing the Southlands come as standalone stretch goal items. These include both new and existing adventures set in the Southlands, for levels 1 to 10, as well as expanded takes on Southlands magic and groups such as the Emerald Order. These PDF rewards are included for everyone who backs at the $25 reward level or higher, and you can see them marked in the Stretch Goal graphics with the \"Bonus Goal!\" icon. Depending on how many are ultimately unlocked, some will be delivered in January and February; others will come later. \nThe various rewards and bundles are described and listed to the right, and shown in the chart below. In addition, this project has been selected for the Kickstarter Add-Ons Beta (see below). After you choose your main pledge, you'll be presented with the option to add additional items in whatever combination works best for you.\nNote that there will be no pledge management step for this project; it is not possible to pledge $1 now and add on rewards later. A print preorder may be made available through the Kobold Press store for late backers. Surveys requesting your address will come from Kickstarter.\nThis project has been selected by the Kickstarter team for Kickstarter's Beta Add-Ons feature. This is a new element for Kickstarter that we used to handle in a separate pledge manager, but for the Southlands, add-ons are now included in the Kickstarter campaign directly.\nAdd-ons make it easy to add items to your pledge during the Kickstarter campaign when you want to mix and match. (For example, if you want the Limited Edition package of all 3 books, but you also want a second copy of the Player's Guide softcover and all the Roll20 licenses, you will have the option to add that second copy and the Roll20 bundle as add-ons to your Limited Edition package after you select your pledge level.)\n\n Kickstarter Exclusive\nIn particular, the Tales Beneath the Sands adventure collection is a Kickstarter print exclusive that is available only as an add-on here (PDF and VTT will be available more generally\u2014the print exclusive version is a collector's item). Tales Beneath the Sands collects three adventures into a hardcover trilogy with new art and maps, for a full tomb-centric adventure series in the Southlands. It covers levels 2 to 5 of play, and makes a perfect complement of tomb-crawling to match the urban, treacherous, and roguish adventures in City of Cats.\nWe'll have more information about Add-Ons in the FAQ and are grateful to be part of Kickstarter's new experiment in Add-Ons.\nThis project continues the Kobold Press goal of reducing shipping costs to international backers and shipping in a sustainable way by using friendly, bulk shipments to three main regions outside the United States: Canada, Australia/NZ, and the UK. From there, physical shipments go to backers via Canada Post, Australia Post, and Royal Mail.\nGLOBAL SHIPMENTS: Because of the difficulties we encountered getting Tome of Beasts 2 to backers in a timely way and the increasing costs of international shipping, we're shrinking our printed reward distribution. The Southlands Worldbook, Player's Guide, and City of Cats PDFs and VTTs are all available worldwide; unfortunately, the printed books are not available as part of the Kickstarter in Europe and countries other than on those on the list above. Printed books will be available via local retailers instead. \nWe hope to remedy this situation in future projects. For now, we simply can't provide effective shipping without a high degree of risk in both schedule and cost.\nAs always with our projects, if the Southlands project exceeds its funding goal we will expand several elements. The more people who support the Southlands, the better the rewards are for everyone!\nIn particular, we will add up to 10 adventure and player option PDFs to the rewards for all backers at the $25 level and up. These goals are marked with the Bonus Goal icon in the stretch goal list, because each adds another standalone title to the reward items.\nThat's the last of our stretch goals, as this project has exceeded expectations in every way. A massive thank you to everyone who has supported the 5th Edition Southlands!\n\nAt Kobold Press, a fantastic team of accomplished tabletop gaming professionals is working hard to pull this project together.\nIn addition to the folks listed below, it is very important to us at Kobold Press to involve voices that represent the real-world cultures from which the Southlands draw influence. To make sure we do this project right, we've involved creators who trace their descent to those regions, and as all of the text and art nears completion and the stretch goals are incorporated, we'll continue to employ these diverse creators as well as cultural consultants every step of the way. Please see our FAQ for more information about this important topic.\nRichard Green, Worldbook Lead Designer: Richard Green has been in love with tabletop roleplaying games since 1980.

His adventures have been tormenting role players for two decades now, and he has yet to get over his peculiar obsession with placing pigs in as many adventures as he can, as prominently as he can. His recent adventure Three Little Pigs is the latest blatant example of his sad porcine obsession. He has a peculiar garret home in Per-Bastet, lurking in an alleyway on the borders of the Gnoll Quarter and the Perfume District.\nMeagan Maricle, City of Cats Editor: Meagan Maricle is an editor at Kobold Press and was the lead editor on the Margreve Player\u2019s Guide, Empire of the Ghouls, Underworld Player\u2019s Guide, Tome of Beasts 2, and the ENnie award-winning Creature Codex.

We gathered some of the most respected, most creative, and possibly weirdest minds of the old school roleplaying scene and compiled some of their best work to make this thick magazine.\n3D rendering\nWe made KNOCK! the messy, stuffed to the gills bric-\u00e0-brac we wanted. The book that earns its place on the easy-to-reach part of your gaming shelves. Now, we need you to make the inaugural, proof of concept issue of KNOCK! Magazine a thing that exists in the physical realm. You know, the world of air, earth, dice, and unhealthy snacks.\nThis first issue is 212 pages (A5 format, slightly bigger than digest size: 5.9\u2019 x 8.25\u2019) in beautiful full colour, printed on quality paper (coated 130 gr, with a cover on coated 300 gr). \nIt has everything you\u2019d want from an old school slash adventure gaming publication: articles about the history of Dungeons & Dragons, reflections about genre and gameplay, some clever rules, a bunch of maps, tons of random tables and lists, 7 new classes, 7 new monsters, and 3 complete adventures. If you\u2019re reading this, some of the names below will ring a bell, or five: Emmy Allen, Benjamin Baugh, Joe Brogzin, Caleb Burks, Brooks Dailey, Nicolas Dessaux, Paolo Greco,  James Holloway, Anthony Huso, Arnold K, Ethan Lefevre, Gabor Lux, Bryce Lynch, Fiona Maeve Geist, Chris McDowall, Ben Milton, Gavin Norman, Patrick Ollson, Graphite Prime, Stuart Robertson, Jack Shear, Jason Sholtis, Skullfungus, Sean Stone, Chris Tamm, Daniel Sell, and Vagabundork.\nAnd you\u2019ll recognise some of the artists too: Ivan Caceres, Didier Guiserix, Matthew Houston, Christophe Johnston, Li-An, Dyson Logos, Evlyn M, Tim Molloy, Luka Rejec, Michael Sheppard, Jason Sholtis, Dan Spencer, and Niklas Wistedt. We\u2019ve used their art as inspiration for some fancy, bold page design.\nA smattering of spreads.\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word for it. If the video above didn\u2019t convince you, head to www.themerrymushmen.com, where you\u2019ll be able to flip through previews of every spread in the issue. \nThanks for reading this. We hope you consider jumping onboard the KNOCK! Ship with us. \n\n \u20ac 4500 - A bookmark (almost as big as the mag, 8.2\u2019 x 4.5\u2019 or 21 cm x 12 cm) with an original piece by the legendary Russ Nicholson, and a (silly but useful) random table on the back. All of it KNOCK! themed, of course. \u2022 \u20ac 6000 - A dust cover to protect your precious copy. Inside it, a full adventure! Zaratazarat\u2019s Manse is a 24-room dungeon, a silly take on the classic vivimancer\u2019s manse. \u2022 \u20ac 8000 - We get a raise! Authors and artists will see their payment increased by 10%.\n\n\n\u2022 #1: Mushperson - \u20ac15 (about \u00a313 and US $18) - Digital copy - One for your virtual bookshelf. We recommend reading it while watching a video of a fireplace. You will receive a digital (PDF) copy of Knock! issue 1. If our stretch goals are unlocked, then you will receive the PDFs as part of your rewards package.\n\u2022 #2: Merry Mushperson - \u20ac25 (about \u00a322 and US $29) - Physical copy + Digital copy - The colourful brick for your grubby hands and eager eyes! And a PDF file for your devices. You will receive a physical and a digital copy of Knock! issue 1. If our stretch goals are unlocked, then you will receive them in physical and digital form as part of your rewards package. Shipping cost for France is \u20ac5 and \u20ac9 (about \u00a38 and US $10) for everywhere else.  \n\u2022 #3: Ecstatic Mushperson - \u20ac45 (about \u00a340 and US $53) - 2 x Physical copy + Digital copy - You\u2019re a good friend! Or maybe you want to keep a copy in your magic-proof safe? Whatever the reason, thanks for getting two copies! You will receive two physical and a digital copy of Knock! Issue 1. If our stretch goals are unlocked, then you will receive them in physical and digital form as part of your rewards package. Shipping for France is \u20ac7 and \u20ac13 (about \u00a311.50 and US $15) for everywhere else. \n The mysterious members of this fast growing, shadowy society are legion. There might be one behind you right now! Only two of them have come forward so far: \n\u2022 Olivier Revenu is a game designer, publisher, kamikaze paraglider and horse rider, and gamer since 1983. He created Battles, a wargame mag with five CSR awards. When not publishing nerdy mags, he is an independent graphic designer and lives in the basque country, the best part of the known world.\n\u2022 Eric Nieudan is an award winning game designer and SFF writer, and a dungeon master for hire when he\u2019s not busy falling from a skateboard. He\u2019s been a games industry professional since the last century and has spent the last thirteen years in windy but lovely Dublin, Ireland. He's also the designer of the well respected old school adventure game, Macchiato Monsters.\n\n\ud83d\ude05 We made a small mistake re: shipping. Please read the first update \ud83d\ude05", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\u2022 Well, we\u2019ve been working on this for two years... So everything is written, edited, illustrated, and laid out. The mag and both stretch goals are ready to go to print. We\u2019re all done, ready to call the printer as soon as we are funded.\n\n\u2022 We know printing and publishing inside out. Between the two of us, we have something like half a century of experience with magazines, books, and games. This particular outfit has been publishing Battles Magazine, five time winner of the Charlie S Roberts award. Battles is distributed globally from France since 2009. \n\n\u2022 Shipping is always a concern, especially in the times we live in. But the estimate we give in the rewards section is a maximum. Hopefully, it\u2019ll cost you less to get your copy. \nPrinting schedules are also a question, but we are confident that we\u2019ll be able to ship in January 2021.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Mushperson", "descp": "Digital copy (about \u00a313 and US $18)\n\u2022 A PDF version of KNOCK!

The Let\u2019s Dig for Treasure, Let\u2019s Summon Demons, and Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers games will immerse you into these hilariously dark retro worlds. Featuring clever and beautiful fan-favorite artwork, each game is a wild romp through the parallel Rhodes universe. The games are quick to learn and are created for 2-6 players, ages 14 and up.\nDynomite Games is an old-school sub-brand of Cryptozoic Entertainment. With a diverse portfolio of licensed and original IPs, Cryptozoic\u2019s catalog covers a broad spectrum of tabletop games and collectibles including Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and the DC Deckbuilding games.\n\nWe've made simple, streamlined game engines (with very little set-up time) so that anyone can dive right in--but we've seasoned the games with enough hidden depth and unique design space to satisfy all of you hardcore gamers too!\nCheck out a brief overview of each of these games:\nIt's the funky-freshest Push-Your-Luck experience out there, for the whole family! Just shuffle up the deck and divide it into 3 \"Dig Stacks\" and you're ready to start digging for treasure!\n1. On your turn, choose and \"dig up\" a card from any of the Dig Stacks...look for cards worth a lot of points, or cards that trigger a powerful effect, such as stealing a card from another player!  \n2. You can stop digging at any time, or keep digging up cards for as long as you want...the more cards you dig up before you \"stop,\" the more you stand to gain--but be careful--if you dig up a 2nd Worms Card, or even a SINGLE skeleton card, your turn will end immediately and you'll lose *EVERYTHING* you dug up so far (this turn)! \n3. Once an entire Dig Stack is empty, the game is over and players add up the total point values on their cards!  Be sure to look and see if you scored any \"bonus point\" effects (you did make sure to dig up some Milk to go with your Cookies, right?). \n4. You've got all kinds of zany stuff to find while digging: Loyal Dogs (protect you from a Skeleton!), Sewer Lines (worth negative points--give it to your least favorite opponent!), heck, you might even transcend death with The Crown of the Lich Lord, or turn those pesky worms into big points with Skwirmz the Worm God! \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know, Let's Summon Demons!  Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the \"rotten\" kids or sharing the love with the \"sweet\" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player--the best Demon Summoner--will walk away a winner!\n1. Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it... \n2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available for purchase (the low, low price of 3 soul tokens) to all players--this is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combo together! \n3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice--if any player's cards they've acquired \"match\" the total rolled then that card activates--often resulting in the acquisition of more soul tokens! More soul tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, means even more soul tokens--but to what end?\n4. Well, you can sacr--er--discard 3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons --and has a balance of 10 souls on top of that--they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here!  Mom & Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your Kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space--in order to score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!\n1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each Kid you have in the Library). \n2. Remember, you want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!  \n3. But watch out!  When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a \"STRANGER SPACE!\" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may just have to re-route your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid--even one that has already scored--but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!\n\n\nLike what you see? Giggling with glee? Store each game together when you back all three! We personally guarantee that this sleek and convenient slipcase looks a lot better on your bookshelf than a haphazard stack of boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the game to start shipping in June 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., we cover customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. Shipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two or three games (\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d and \"Slipcase Exclusive\" Tiers) costs almost the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first rodeo!

Newcomers and existing fans will love this updated twist on a classic, with incredible new artwork.\n\nAttack and conquer to build your power structure with cards representing different aspects of our world\u2014complete your pyramid and win! Fun, streamlined game-play. Conspiring and deceitful back-stabbing encouraged\u2014necessary, really. See backer video for examples of gameplay.\n\nThe Servants of Cthulhu are back to destroy all! The global authoritarian Bavarian Illuminati meet their sworn enemy, the chaos-mongering Discordian Society! Will Big-Box Stores turn criminal and align themselves with Anti-Vaxxers to wreak havoc? It\u2019s your turn\u2026\n\nFans, the wait is over! This new twist on a classic design makes possible a video-game version of this long-unavailable treasure from Steve Jackson Games. 150 cards in core game, including 6 Illuminati\u2014now every backer gets duplicates of the 150 cards, all the better to stack the deck with. \n\nSocially-distanced fun for 1-6 players, avg. playtime around 45 minutes. Best on desktops and tablets. Steam. Apple. Google Play. \n\nSample Card Art for Men in Black, Conspiracy Theorists, Social Media, and the Music Industry.\nWhy we need your support\nThis is a passion-project based on an award-winning game with a deep fan base. \nIlluminati: New World Order sold 60+ million cards, though card prices ($1,000 or more for a complete set!) keep it out of the hands of modern players. \nPeople have wanted this video game for years! \nDerek Pearcy, who in 1994 helped produce Illuminati: New World Order for Steve Jackson Games, long wondered how to adapt Illuminati as a satisfying video game\u2014too often, table-top adaptations aren\u2019t that much fun. He finally dreamed up a solution, and with Steve Jackson\u2019s advice and blessing, the project was born.\nProject includes video game development; 150+ cards with art for the core game; 3 seasons of now 40-cards each, introducing new themes, cards, plot twists; and localization (see below).\nGame-play in a nutshell\nIt\u2019s simple once you\u2019re playing. Players take the role of an Illuminati\u2014a secret, global conspiracy\u2014each with a different personality and strategy that works for them\u201a and against their opponents. For example, the Cthulhu player wins by destroying things, the Gnomes of Zurich by amassing money, and Bavaria grows by collecting raw power, and so on. You\u2019re dealt a card at the beginning of each turn, and then try attack and conquer cards\u2014the deck\u2019s or other people\u2019s\u2014to fill your power-structure pyramid.\nTo make the game more interesting, Plot cards allow players to reinforce themselves as well as mess with each other. Plot cards can:\nweaken opponents\nstrengthen your cards or weaken your enemies\u2019\nchange any card's alignments\u2014turn the peaceful Boy Sprouts into violent killers\nand otherwise cause mayhem and make your opponents cry.\nAlong the road to world domination, the unexpected consequences are hilarious. Maybe you'll have the CIA attack the Cycle Gangs. How? Uhh\u2026through the Convenience Stores! With support from\u2026a Swiss Bank Account? In your next turn, the Big-Box Stores become criminal and align themselves with Anti-Vaxxers to wreak havoc! As the night goes on, you\u2019ll see the current world order go sideways. The new world might match your hopes, or your fears.\nFirst one to build their pyramid wins\u2014and the winner collects a card they can use in a future game.\nYour Illuminati can share its vast power with its puppets, helping grow the conspiracy.\nIn Party Mode, everyone draws from the same deck, guaranteed to be well-balanced for whichever Illuminati are in the game. It\u2019s a good way to enter this world and start collecting cards.\nIn Stacked-Deck Mode, people can bring a set of 12 cards of choice to the table. (If anyone know how to stack a deck, it\u2019s the Illuminati.) You can buy Starter Packs, crafted to suit each Illuminati's strengths, or build them yourself from cards you\u2019ll collect after winning games.\nSocial aspect of Illuminati Confirmed: A newsfeed down one side of the screen lets the players have free and frank exchanges of view, almost like a social network for the New World Order. The newsfeed is live, but uses a menu of pre-made responses\u2014to avoid randos creating a bad vibe.\nDifficulty rating: Satisfyingly rich, but not that hard. Includes edgy and nuanced political humor that kids younger than 14 might not be ready for.\nGame duration: around 45 minutes.\n\nHow to Build Your Conspiracy & Take Over the World\nEvery group card is rated by its Power and Resistance as a number from 0 to 5. Subtract the target\u2019s resistance from the attacker\u2019s Power, and that will tell you how likely the attacker can wrestle control over its target.\nThe most unusual and important game mechanic in the game\u2014and most crucial to giving an attacker leverage when a target puts up a fight\u2014are Alignments. There are four pairs of opposing alignments, and two special ones. Here\u2019s how they work: every matching alignment that attacker and target have in common reduces the target\u2019s Resistance by 2 points, while every opposing alignment boosts the target\u2019s Resistance by 2. \nFor example, the Flat Earthers are Weird and Conservative\u2026\n\u2026while the Semiconscious Liberation Army is Criminal, Violent, Liberal, and Weird! \nAttributes & Special Abilities\nIt is rare for cards to have more than two alignments. See Marketing Execs, for example.\nWhat she does have is an Attribute, shown by the broadcasting tower on the right side\u2014that means we\u2019re looking at a Media group. \nWhile the game doesn\u2019t mess with attributes like it does with alignments, they can be just as crucial to success. Several Plot cards can only be powered by a Media group\u2014like Scandal or Miracle Diet Plan\u2014or will only work on a Media group\u2014like Pulitzer Prize and Censorship. \nSome groups are Places\u2014like Germany, Silicon Valley, or Stonehenge\u2014which have special attributes of their own: Coastal, Huge, and Nation. Soon you'll see Disaster cards, special Plots to damage Places. Some disasters, like Tidal Wave, only work on Coastal places, while some disasters, like Meteor Strike, are less effective against Huge places. A Huge place like China can shrug off a single meteor falling from the sky, though the same threat may worry the Pentagon.\n\nTHE PLAN\nWe are racing toward a functional prototype! We\u2019ve recently accelerated our plans, offering Early Access to higher-tier backers from February through April, with a full launch in August. If we meet our Kickstarter goal, we will begin releasing the three seasons in October 2021. Each season will feature at least 20 cards, each bound by a common theme. Here are the seasons we commit to delivering as part of our basic funding plan:\n\nSeason 1: Assassins!\u2014Bringing individual people into the game as controllable cards, and (mostly) bad things to do them\nSeason 2: Ancient Secrets\u2014Magic comes to the world of Illuminati\nSeason 3: Weird Science\u2014Gadgets, gizmos and the shadowy figures who use them\n\nWait\u2014Will There Be More?\nIt should shock no one that we are planning for more than three seasons, taking players through a well-rounded story with wicked twists and turns. Check back in through late-December for updates.\n\nPlatforms\nWe\u2019re committed to making Illuminati Confirmed available for desktop and tablets through Steam, as well as on Google Play and the Apple App Store.\nLocalization\nWe are working with several companies to get Illuminati Confirmed properly localized. Most people think about that as \u201ctranslation,\u201d though that sells short the hard work these professionals perform. Our development lead, Derek Pearcy, spent a decade designing localization support into many complex, widely used user interfaces. Our game will support multiple languages from day one with little to no extra development effort.\nBecause Illuminati has always been extremely popular in Germany and France, those two are first on the list. We\u2019re considering Spanish (with different localization for Spain, Mexico, and South America), as well as Portuguese, Japanese, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Simplified Chinese. We can tell you more once the Kickstarter is over, but we will make decisions based on demand, so be sure to let us hear your voices.\n\nTHE ILLUMINATI STORY  \nThe first version of Illuminati, on half-sized cards in 1982.\nIn 1982, Steve Jackson published the original Illuminati card game. It was both darkly serious as well as funny, a satire reflecting conspiracy theories and pop-culture at the time. In 1994, Illuminati: New World Order was released as an early Collectible Card Game with nearly four times as many cards as any previous version of the game, updated with color art and then-modern conspiracy thinking. As a game, it was also fiercely rich and complex. \nConspiracy theorists claim that the 1990s version of the game made uncanny predictions about the future. Will Illuminati Confirmed expose clues to upcoming global struggles? Pledge to find out. For more background on that, check out the Deep Cuts Podcast featuring interviews with Steve Jackson and Derek Pearcy.\nBACKER TIERS\nWe are offering a variety of tiers, including the basic game, additional seasons, starter packs and even lifetime subscriptions to any and all future digital content we release for Illuminati Confirmed. Some items like special Illuminati tile-markers (bronze, silver, gold, as well as the ultra-rare green, glowing neutonium) and the INWO deck will only ever be available through this Kickstarter. See notes at the bottom for details on some of the special rewards.\n We\u2019re giving every player 2 copies of each card\u2014300 cards!\n We\u2019re now doubling the number of cards per season, giving this tier 340 cards!\n After doubling the number of cards per season, this 3-season tier has 420 cards! \nNew! This tier now comes with a playable adaptation of 1994\u2019s award-winning Illuminati: New World Order\u2014at least 300 faithfully adapted cards for a total of 720 cards! \nEach starter deck provides a set of at least 12 cards, each set designed to help an Illuminati shine. Every deck duplicates cards already available in the game, though having duplicates of cards which specifically help you is a good thing. Six decks means 72 more cards for a total of 792 cards.\nLastly, your triangular Illuminati tile will have a bronze border around it, showing everyone your greatness as a Kickstarter campaign backer.\nWe plan to stand up our online services in stages, on-boarding more and more people over time. Even more importantly, we want feedback on the earliest stable versions of the local multiplayer game. Since it\u2019s hard to pick who gets to go first, we thought we\u2019d let people pay to get in line, beginning with this tier. The order of access will be:\nEternally Illuminated + Game with SJ & DP\nYOU ARE ILLUMINATED\nEternally x4 + Derek\u2019s INWO Set\nEternally Illuminated x4\nEternally Illuminated + 2 1994 INWO Decks\nEternally Illuminated\nEsoteric Order of Early Access\nWe expect to begin seeding backers with local multi-player versions of the game\u2014using original cards and art from the 1990s edition\u2014in March, then on-boarding early backers to our online service no later than June 2021. Players in each group above will gain access to the game in the order they backed the project, from earlier to later.\nAlso, your triangular Illuminati tile will have a silver border around it, showing everyone how fantastic you are as a Kickstarter campaign backer.\nAs long as we put out digital ILCO content, you\u2019ll get it. That includes everything, even limited-time card releases. Pretty straightforward. You\u2019ll get 1 or 4 digital keycodes granting your account access to the content you\u2019re owed.\nAlso, your triangular Illuminati tile will have a GOLD border around it, because you're amazing and the other global conspiracies you're playing against should cower before you.\nTucked away in a box for 26 years, Derek\u2019s had a shrink-wrapped Point-of-Purchase display containing 6 pairs of shrink-wrapped Limited Edition INWO decks from among some of the very first cards to show up at the SJ Games offices. You and a friend can bust them open and play just like they did in 1994. \nAs shown in the list above, 2 lucky people will be the first players onboarded once we\u2019re ready to test the game and its online services\u2014andd Steve and Derek will play against you. They\u2019ll probably be too busy sinking each other, so you may actually have a chance of winning. We can work with you to schedule a time mutually available to both backers, though it will be bounded by Steve Jackson\u2019s Central Time Zone, between sunrise and early evening.\nAs long as we put out digital ILCO content, you\u2019ll get it\u2014but you'll get 4 digital keycodes granting access to all that content. Split it with 3 friends for less than any of you could become Eternally Illuminated on your own, or bring a ho-ho-whole lot of diabolical joy to 3 friends you look forward to trouncing in the battle for world domination. \nWhat it says: all the cards available in the original, 1994 retail release of Illuminati: New World Order. Derek has two: one set in individual sleeves and the other in a binder. Pick which one you\u2019d prefer\u2014he\u2019s only parting with one of them.\nEveryone knows what Neutonium is, so we won\u2019t insult anyone\u2019s intelligence by talking about it here. But\u2014do you want to be an agent on the F.B.I. card? Or a guy in a suit getting dragged away in handcuffs on the Wall Street card? We will work with you to get your likeness on something that works for you. It will on everyone\u2019s version of that card, so let\u2019s make it count.\n\nIf you have any questions, please ask and we\u2019ll happily update these details.\nEarly Pencils for Upcoming Illuminati Confirmed Cards. Here we have Otaku, the Mafia, Hackers, and Lawyers.\nFUNDING GOAL\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to get feedback from fans, and people are thrilled about what we want to do. Still, it\u2019s a significant investment of time and money. We\u2019re launching this Kickstarter to raise the funds to finish the new art, complete the game development, and build the online services needed to support a modern game-play experience.\nWe can make Illuminati Confirmed, including the core game and three seasons, if we hit our goal of $210,000.

Bong... Bong\nThe bells of the church wake you suddenly in the middle of the night. A thick, red hued fog has surrounded your home of Meadhan. Almost everyone in the entire village has disappeared and shadowy figures dart in and out of the corners of your vision. You leave the safety of your home with pitchforks, cleavers, and shovels ready to face the evils of the night. Something wicked has come to Meadhan!!\nA conspiracy of ravens attacks a poor, helpless girl. Save her!\nA Conspiracy of Ravens is a horror themed adventure module that can be played as a 0-level funnel or as a 1st level adventure that uses  Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG . A \"funnel\" is a game in which players will play 2 to 4 everyday townsfolk who begin at 0-level with no special abilities or skills. Players use cunning, tactical retreat, and brute force through strength of numbers to overcome perilous situations and bloodthirsty monsters to save the day. The very few, lucky peasants who survive become emboldened with new abilities as 1st level characters and embark on glorious, treasure filled quests with a new found spirit of adventure.\nThe \"funnel\" game is synonymous with Dungeon Crawl Classics tabletop gaming. It is an excellent way to introduce completely new players to role playing and a very fun way to keep veteran players on their toes. A Conspiracy of Ravens takes classic aspects of horror that you love and reimagines them in a frightening new light... or darkness.\nLost children in need of being saved... or are they?\nA suspicious old lady... she could be a benefit or curse to the party.\nMan's best friend... think Cujo but much, much more gruesome.\nPossession... who doesn't love someone who can spin their head 360\u00b0\nA sacrificial finale that puts the Salem witch trials to shame... and much more!\nA Conspiracy of Ravens is non setting specific and can be easily adapted into any fantasy world. The module has gone through many playtests during online conventions like Founders and Legends III and Bride of Cyclops Con and has been thoroughly worked over by various home groups. \nThe current page count of the finished module is 24 pages, but with stretch goals that would be increased to an anticipated 28 or 32 pages. Interior pages will be 60# offset with black ink and a 12pt C1S (coated 1 side) color cover. Module dimensions will be 8.5\" X 11\".\nTomlin, Meadhan's Dwarven Blacksmith, but not quite how you remember him.\nWhat's New?\n With this module I wanted to bring something new to the table, a new idea on how adventures can be played. Everyone knows that is a very bad idea to split the party, almost always ending in misfortune, death, or a TPK (total party kill). In A Conspiracy of Ravens and subsequent modules to follow, one signature element will be situations in which the party is forced to choose whether or not to split up, or has no choice at all in being taken down different paths. For this particular DCC horror adventure the party begins the module split into different groups and must navigate a deceiving encounter to come together as one. But that is only part of what is inside.\nThe entire module is completely packed with new, original art by some amazing artists\nNew tables\nNew monsters\nA table with new mercurial magic effects including my personal favorite:\nYou Are a Hero! For the next 1d7 days, the caster acts only for the benefit of others, accepting hopeless quests, saving the innocent, defending the helpless, donating all worldly possessions, and acting completely selflessly -in the exact opposite of DCC fashion\nThe hint of a new Patron coming soon in ensuing modules\nBeautiful, hand-drawn, original maps returning you to the old school feeling of playing in the basement with friends\nA devious, new trap that could result in a TPK by itself\nAnd of course a new spell - Emirikol\u2019s Sacrificial Assistance!\nWill you prevent the Ravens from summoning the 14th King of Hell, Mistolresanees?\nPledge Tiers\n$2 - The Beetle: For this tier you will receive all the emails on the progression and status of the project and my gratitude.\n$7 - The Raven: A PDF copy of A Conspiracy of Ravens, all unlocked digital stretch goals, be listed as a backer in the module, and my unceasing gratitude. \n$13 - The Homunculus: A PDF copy of A Conspiracy of Ravens, a softcover print copy shipped to your door, be listed as a backer in the module, all unlocked stretch goals, and my perpetual thanks.\n$18 - The Imp: A PDF copy of A Conspiracy of Ravens, a softcover print copy shipped to your door with the Kickstarter exclusive foil cover, be listed as a backer in the module, all unlocked stretch goals, and my undying appreciation and adoration. The exclusive KS foil cover will never again be reprinted as long as I own the rights to the module, which I anticipate will be forever.\n\nStretch Goals\n FULLY FUNDED !! \n $2000 - Fully Funded! You deserve a reward simply for helping us meet our goal and your support of bringing the dreams of creators like myself to life. 25 backers will receive an autographed copy of A Conspiracy of Ravens with my signature and a message of thanks. Imagine if you could go back in time to get an autographed copy of one of Gygax's first module! Now I am not saying that I will ever be that legendary, but every once in a while dreams do come true.\nNote: Autographed copy will be substituted for unsigned copy. The 25 backers will still only receive (1) one book per pledge level.\nUnlocked!\n $3000 - More Art! As you can see by the original art that is shown in this campaign, the module is already full of excellent art. This goal will allow the commission of more pieces to completely stuff the module with astounding visuals and ensure that the artists are rewarded with a bonus for their time, effort, and passion.\nUnlocked!\n $4000 - Upgrade to Printing! Interior paper will be increased to 80lb text uncoated and exterior cover will be increased to 14pt C1S.\n $5000 - More Maps! Personally, I love maps. With this goal 3 additional bonus maps will be included in the pdf and module. All will be drawn by hand and touched up digitally. Bonus maps are:\n1. Area map including the surrounding world around Meadhan, for further    adventure expansion in a homebrew campaign. This map will also coincide with future titles.\n2. Map of the interior of the mayor of Meadhan's estate, including the trap that could result in a TPK .\n3. Map of the interior of Speedling House for Boys. A creepy orphanage that hides a disturbing, new monster, the Humsier.\nThe Humsier!\n $6000 - More Content! New mini-settings will be created for both Mayor Wenchell's Estate and the Speedling House for Boys. Both settings currently have only 1 encounter based on the time it would take to play the module. With this goal I will create both mini-settings with full descriptions of all of the rooms, including multiple encounters in each setting to coincide with the maps. This will add an optional 1-2 hours of gameplay per area, depending on your players.\nNote: This reward will be delivered at a later date as a PDF, not included with the delivery of the original pledge levels or in print form.\n $7000 - More for the Players! It isn't just about the Judges, with this goal the print module will come with a full set of illustrated handouts to give to the players during play.\n $8000 - Custom Character Sheet! Custom 0-level character sheets will be commissioned so your players will be able to brag about having the coolest PC sheet around.\nNote: This reward will be delivered at a later date as a PDF AND a pack will be mailed to you in physical form. When we are able to come out of our houses again, you will be ready.\n $9000 - Art Print! Backers who back at the Homunculus and Imp physical print levels will receive (1) one limited edition 8.5\" x 11\" art print of one of the original art pieces from the module. These selections will be randomly selected and shipped with the module.\n 10,000 - ?????\n\n The Artists\nSome amazing artists have signed on to illustrate this module, let me introduce you to:\n Melanie (Florencio) Sexton is a multimedia artist who has done comic work for both pleasure and corporate.

Back the Kickstarter today!\nTell me more about Dungeon Crawl Classics\n Dungeon Crawl Classics is a d20 tabletop role-playing game published by Goodman Games. Heavily influenced by Gary Gygax's  Appendix N, Goodman Games has modernized the rules but remained true to the ideals of old school sword and sorcery games. Fast paced gameplay, unpredictable magics, 0-level funnel adventures, and a little bit of Luck are just some of the hallmarks that put DCC RPG above other games. These qualities make it a fun, imaginative, and memorable adventure ending with your character perishing in horribly, epic ways or living in glory upon piles of treasure!

One third of the art has been completed and another third is currently being worked on. Layout is about 60% complete. Funding for this module will go to the commission of the remaining pieces of art, printing and shipping, and to seed art for the next module in the series. Cover art is not finalized and subject to change.\n\nI anticipate being able to ship in April, but due to the unpredictability of Covid situations I have put the ship date as June. I would rather get it to you early than late.\n\nUnfortunately due to the fluctuation and increase of shipping costs, a print copy of A Conspiracy of Ravens will only be available through this Kickstarter to US backers. It will however be available at a later date on the Goodman Games store website.

This is a go-to reference for a system neutral, old school inspired fantasy setting that aims to provide a \u201cdrop-in-and-drop-out\u201d experience. You can run a small side quest within the peaks, provide a parallel campaign to your normal adventures, or simply pull from this packet for game-able material in your role playing game sessions.\nContained in this packet you\u2019ll find three particular peaks featuring dream-like locations, strange inhabitants, unique overland features, an extensive bestiary, and much more.\nWe hope you enjoy your time in the peaks!\nDigital mockup of cover\nThe Three Peaks\nPassage Peak, Dream Peak, and Bleak Peak are three particular peaks that all feature unique aspects and deep mysteries for players to explore. Each peak can be thought of as an individual world (or setting), all with specific methods used to enter a given peak. None of these particular peaks are accessible via physical travel, as each peak represents a mental state that only exists within a character's mind. Experiences will vary greatly between each of them, with memories (or nightmares) waiting to be made; and adventures to be had. \n Passage Peak - A deceptively tranquil mountain range filled with stunning meadows, planes, and forests. Passage Peak represents a metaphorical \"happy place\" for some, and a literal feeding frenzy for those that seek to benefit from the positive energy generated in this breathtaking realm.\n Dream Peak - Unbelievable beauty weaves throughout Dream Peak, as if perfection was a flowing river that washes over the rolling hills caught between awe-inducing snow capped mountains. However, the wondrous structures, majestic beasts, and incredible views cannot hide the insidious events that occur within Dream Peak. \n Bleak Peak - Extremely dangerous, deprived of color, and full of threats. Bleak Peak represents turmoil, and it's terrain reflects that as it bends and sharpens with every minute; convulsing as if it were mutating in front of the viewer's eyes. Home to sinister factions, unspeakable monstrosities, and insanity inducing spectral beings. \nThe Full Contents\nA Packet of Particular Peaks is an art-heavy setting source book intended to be used for fantasy tabletop role playing games. It can be used with nearly any pre-existing system, and does not include system specific stats, rules, or restrictions. \nBoth digital and physical copies will include:\nDetailed descriptions of 3 unique mountain settings\nOutlined methods of entering each peak\nHighlighted inhabitants, random events, overland features, and locations of interest for each of the peaks\nBestiary of 18 illustrated creatures\n3 hex maps - one for each peak!\nd100 magic items. That's right, one-hundred!\nA handy adventure prompt generator\n32+ original illustrations by L.F. OSR \n12+ additional information tables\nDigital mockup of interior pages\nSpecifications\nAlthough these specifications are subject to change based on the total amount of funds raised, the current specifications are as follows:\n5.5\" x 8.5\" perfect bound softcover book\nThick natural felt weave cover (with inside cover printing)\nNatural uncoated interior pages\nBlack and white printing using premium inks\n75+ total pages\nThe Deluxe Tier\nAlongside our Digital and Physical reward tiers, we will also be offering the Deluxe Tier limited to 50 special backers that wish to experience all that the peaks have to offer. Backers of at the Deluxe Tier will receive:\nPhysical copy of A Packet of Particular Peaks\nDigital (.PDF) copy of A Packet of Particular Peaks\nYour name printed in the interior front cover of the book\nA postcard featuring bespoke artwork on one side, with a handwritten message from one of the inhabitants of the Peaks on the other\nHigh quality \"I Visited the Peaks\" decal-style sticker\nA one-page dungeon trifold (physical & digital .PDF copies included)\nA unique, cut to shape bookmark\nExclusive 8\" x 8\" print, signed and numbered by L.F. OSR \nFree \"A Glance at the Peaks\" Digital Trifold\nNow available, A Glance At The Peaks is a trifold featuring some details about the peaks, a couple of beasts that you might find there, a one-page dungeon, and the official \"A Packet of Particular Peaks Theme Song\" composed by fantasy synthesizer composer Quest Master!\nClick here to download A Glance at the Peaks\n\nIt's an honor to work with Quest Master to help bring the sounds of the peaks to life. You can find more of Quest Master's music on Bandcamp or on Instagram.\nWhat is L.F. OSR?\nL.F. OSR originally started as an art project inspired by early role playing game supplements, aiming to create original artwork that hearkens back to art styles featured in those older materials, while incorporating a unique twist on the traditional format. Aside from creating original artwork for fantasy worlds, L.F. OSR has recently started a new journey designing game-able content for role playing games, producing original supplements, and supporting the OSR community.\n L.F.

The story takes our heroes from greenhorn cowpunchers to hardened trail hands, letting players take on the roles of regular cowboys and cowgirls or any mix of Deadlands' unique character types.\nInterior spreads from the book, already laid out and ready for printing! Your support helps us create the additional materials we think will add to the entire Deadlands experience!\nArchetype Cards\nOur Archetype Cards allow players to jump into Blood Drive or any other Deadlands game quickly. We gave you a passel of pregenerated characters in the original Deadlands Kickstarter, and Set 3 adds even more ready-to-play heroes and heroines to choose from!\nPrint Version: 127x89mm on sturdy and durable 350gsm cardstock.\n12 new Archetype Cards suitable for Blood Drive or your own Deadlands games. Stay tuned for updates and previews as the Kickstarter drives on!\nPawns\nThis project features three sheets of Deadlands Pawns containing a selection of characters and critters and brand new terrain pieces as well! (We'll have art to show you soon, partners!)\nWe'll supplement your maps with campfires, a chuck wagon, hangin' trees, and other bits you'll find useful for Blood Drive or your own outdoor adventures, all printed on thick, die-cut punchboard. \nBeautifully illustrated front and back and easy to transport, Deadlands Pawns make your games come to life on the tabletop, especially when used with our gorgeous new map packs (see below)!\nSample pawns from our first pawn set. We'll have new art to show soon for these Blood Drive-specific pawns.\nInfernal Device Cards\nMad Scientists in the Weird West harness the Hellish energy of the superfuel known as ghost rock to power their incredible gizmos. These quick reference cards grant convenient access to the most important information about six common infernal gadgets, adding to those already printed in the original boxed set.\nPrint Version: 2.5\" x 3.5\" on 300gsm cardstock.\nMap Packs\nDeadlands Map Packs are large, 30\" x 24\" double-sided laminated maps for use with miniatures or our Deadlands pawns. They're marked with a  light one inch grid, perfect for Savage Worlds. Map Pack 3: End of the Line features a train station, corner saloon, and other classic western buildings. Map Pack 4: Ambush Pass features wilderness terrain ideal for use in Blood Drive. We'll have detailed images for you soon!\nPrint Version: 30\" x 24\", double-sided, laminated cardstock for use with dry and wet-erase pens.\nArtist's render of a Deadlands pawn on Map Pack 1 (Grand Saloon).\nOur Kickstarter Boosters are smaller support projects for our existing lines. They come with Booster Rewards built-in rather than Stretch Goals. We're definitely going to print them on our own no matter what and want you to know that up front, but are asking for your backing so we can order the right amount and most importantly, create the extras that add to the entire experience for all of us\u2014like maps, pawns, and additional Archetype Cards. We play too, and we want all these goodies as much as we hope you do!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is very fortunate and grateful to have a loyal and established group of friends and fans who enjoy playing our games, but it's sometimes very hard to get our products to you. We love game stores and sell to them through our fulfillment partners at Studio2 and through traditional distribution, but we also know many of you don't have a store in your neighborhood, or your local store just doesn't carry our games.\nFor those that do, great! Retailers who want in on our Kickstarters get discounted versions of the rewards including Stretch Goals for them and their customers. If you're a retailer, just sign up to our newsletter for all the details. (And gamers, please feel free to let your local store know!) Retailers also get their rewards when backer orders go out, usually several weeks before they show up in the traditional distribution chain.\nIn sum...\nIf you want Blood Drive and the extras we're offering with it, back this Kickstarter Booster.\nIf you want Blood Drive but prefer to support your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the Digital reward level here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later next year. (But be sure to tell them or they might not order it on their own!)\nDeadlands is the premier Weird Western setting. You can download the free Test Drive, here to see what it's all about.\nIf you missed the Deadlands: the Weird West Kickstarter, you can still get in on the action through the pledge manager, which is still open. Anything you add through that pledge manager will be delivered as soon as it arrives in our warehouse in early 2021.\nYou'll be able to add these items to your Blood Drive order in the Pledge Manager.\nYou can also add on our other Deadlands products once we launch the Blood Drive pledge manager (available sometime after this Kickstarter Booster closes and funds). There you'll be able to add on extras like the Deadlands core boxed set, pawns, the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign, town maps, Action Cards, Bennies, and more!\nSpread the word!\nIt's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to help boost the signal, you can do so using the following channels. Much obliged, amigo!\nBlood Drive is written and in layout. Your support allows us to create the extras and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the book and cards a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website  first, then through DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. \nWe'll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter through the pledge manager, but below is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\n*Prices exclusive of VAT/GST, shown in USD. We will collect and pay customs in the pledge manager. USA backers pay no additional shipping on Add Ons!\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box, but the Book Only tier will likely ship in a padded envelope).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Welcome, Retailer!\" Newsletter here for the basics we recommend for your store!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time). Customers of Savage Retailers may request complimentary PDFs of books purchased by emailing Info@peginc.com.\nAny Questions?

Now with 100% newer gaming content that you can drop right into your post-apocalyptic, sci-fi, or fantasy genre-mash role playing game. 9 out of 10 wasteland warriors agree, you don\u2019t want to go into an ancient science installation without one.\nWhat\u2019s a Megazine?\nBigger and better than a fanzine, not quite as fancy as a magazine, SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.2 is a megazine. It\u2019s 6\u201d x 9\u201d in size, with 64+ pages of pro gaming content created and produced by industry veterans. This megazine is also perfect-bound with a spine, so they stand up nicely on a shelf as you collect them! The megazine concept is an exciting new format we here at Mudpuppy Games are proud to pioneer, and we can\u2019t wait to see how many others adopt what we think is a pretty nifty format for jamming a gaming publication straight on your shelf, or into game bag or backpack.\nHere are just a few of the apocalyptic delights awaiting you in SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.2.\nManifest of Wonders\nWe are extremely proud of the creative team we gathered for issue No.1, and now they are all back for SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.2 \u2014 plus a few exciting additions! We\u2019ve got a mini-adventure by James M. Spahn (The Hero\u2019s Journey, The One Ring, Star Wars), fiction by James M. Ward (Metamorphosis Alpha, Gamma World, 77 Lost Worlds), and more great stuff from Levi Combs (Planet X Games), Skeeter Green (Skeeter Green Productions), Tim Kask, Travis Hanson, and Jolly Blackburn. Check out the Table of Contents below!\nContents subject to change prior to publication, because sometimes we have great ideas later.\nNot Just For the Radioactive at Heart\nSure, all this great new gaming material has been designed with the discriminating post-apocalyptic gamer in mind, but it is also eminently suitable for fantasy games \u2014 especially if your campaign needs a fresh jolt of excitement. In both the pulp literature that inspired our hobby and in the fantasy games of yore, many a magic item or monster turned out to have scientific origins. The contents of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN are ideal for getting seen-it-all done-it-all fantasy players back on their toes and engaged with new surprises. All material presented is useable with any d20-based game system.\nBACKER-ONLY EXCLUSIVE\nNeed a new monster or treasure for tonight's game? It's digitally indexed right here.\nThe CRYPTIC CONCORDANCE is a backer-only exclusive not available to the general public. It contains an art-filled index of every mutant, monster, machine, or malevolent magic that has appeared in issues No.1 and No.2 of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN, plus any of the same that appeared in our books Check This Artifact and Fight This Mutant. Each entry is cross-referenced by book and page number, just to make a GM\u2019s life that much easier when it\u2019s time to add a new creature, class, spell, or artifact to your post-apocalyptic or genre-mashed fantasy game.\n The Perfect Holiday Gift!\nHoliday gift giving like it was 1977! Print this digital certificate out, put it in a box, then wrap it up.\nWant to get a copy of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.2 as a gift for someone else, but you're concerned that the megazine won't be released until March 2021? We have a plan! Directly after this projects funds, all backers will receive a digital Early Bird Gift Certificate that you can print out and give them right on the holiday.\nHow to Pledge for Multiple Copies\nNeed to pledge for multiple copies of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #2? Just select the pledge level for the PRINT + PDF and fill out the dollar amount in multiples of $15 (i.e., $30 for two copies, $45 for three copies, etc).\nRetailer Pledge Level\nEspecially in these times, we support all of our brick-and-mortar game stores. If you are a retailer and wish to pledge at the Retailer Pledge Level, all we ask is that you send us verification via email or messages after pledging.\nShipping Costs\nEach book will be shipped to backers via USPS in a sturdy cardboard envelope. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. Shipping and handling is an economical $5 per book shipped. Add-On books ship at an extra $2 each. Retailer shipping will be via Media Mail and is also only $5.\nALL SHIPPING FOR PRINT BOOKS IS TO THE USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. Current International shipping costs are so high that shipping outside the USA is not feasible for Mudpuppy Games at this time. We know that sucks, but much larger companies with better resources than us have struggled with this and failed. Plus we just can\u2019t bring ourselves to charge shipping costs in excess of the price of the product itself, and for that philosophy we can only apologize in advance.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThere aren\u2019t any! We\u2019re not fooling around here. The entirety of funds raised for this project are being devoted to creating one of the best new gaming zines around. They say \u201cContent is King\u201d, and that axiom is our guiding principle at SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN.\nADD-ONS\nDid you miss out on any of our prior projects? We got you. To add-on any of the following items, just click the handy ADD ON button in the pledge manager after pledging and you're all set!\nSCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.1 ($12 backer-only price)\nWith metric tons of mighty new content for your post-apocalyptic or genre-mash fantasy game, SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN No.1 has it all. You\u2019ll be amazed at The Ecology of the Crater Mutant by Levi Combs (Planet X Games), astounded at the robotic mounts of S.A.B.L.E. Rangers by Mike and Elizabeth Stewart (Victorious RPG), and astonished at the malevolent diseases in Mutant Maladies by Skeeter Green (SGP Games). All that and a mini-adventure that\u2019s not-so-mini in Jim Wampler\u2019s The Gene Looms of Janeck-Vacca.\nSCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1 also includes ongoing features that will continue in every issue, with new mutations, new monsters, new artifacts, Retro Reviews of inspirational source media and material, and of course Scientific Comics right in the back featuring Jolly Blackburn and Travis Hanson!\nDigest 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover, 84 pages, PRINT+PDF\nCHECK THIS ARTIFACT ($13 backer-only price)\nCheck This Artifact contains 30 brand-new artifacts of the Ancient Makers, plus a full write up of a new godlike AI and its neural programs (spells), all for use in any d20-based post-apocalyptic role playing game or genre-mash fantasy role playing game.\nDigest 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover, 60 pages, PRINT+PDF\nFIGHT THIS MUTANT ($17 backer-only price)\nFight This Mutant contains over 30 brand-new mutant monsters and races, a whole new Ancient Alliance your player characters can join or fight, a brand-new character class \u2014 the Technomancer, and 15 new neural programs (spells) from 1st through 5th levels.

There was a figure moving out there in the darkness. It seemed to waver as it moved. \u201cIs that Alan?\u201d he asked quietly.\n A rustling in the bushes released another scream from Annie. She clapped her hands over her mouth as soon as it began, stifling the sound.\n\u201cWill you stop that?\u201d Evan snipped.\n Harry stood very still. He could almost sense something around them, just out of his range of vision. A darkness streaked across the corner of his eye. He glanced, but it was gone. It happened again; and again, he turned. There was nothing there.\nScritch. Scritch. Scritch.\nIn the 1980s, strange things happened everywhere...\n\nCreated by Wet Ink Games in partnership with Bloat Games, Dark Places & Demogorgons 5e is a totally new way to experience the game of 80s teen horror originally designed by Eric Bloat and Josh Palmer.\nIn this standalone game, you play as teenagers from \"Anytown, USA\" where strange occurrences have popped up all around. The adults seem lost about what to do; the police are as clueless as ever and aren\u2019t helping. It\u2019s up to you and your friends to figure out what\u2019s going on and stop it from happening again!\nTake on the role of a new student at the local Junior High School and build your character from the ground up using a unique character creation process where you step through student orientation with the school guidance counselor. What is your background? Are you the new kid in town? What did you do this past summer? Are you planning to take part in any extracurricular activities? The choice is yours.\n\nDELUXE BOXED SET COMPONENTS\nArt to be revealed throughout the campaign!\n\nBased on the hugely popular 5th Edition of the world's most popular RPG, Dark Places & Demogorgons adds some new concepts to the familiar ruleset to make a uniquely fun and entertaining game experience. Choose extra-curricular activities to give your characters their bonus proficiencies. Play through the big events of the school year from The Big Game to Dance Night. Prepare for monsters, but remember human threats like The Star Children and Special Agent Spanner can be just as much of a problem.\nCharacters\nDark Places & Demogorgons allows both experienced players and newcomers to be able to create a character in a few short minutes.  Players familiar with 5e will be able to dive right in with the easy to follow character creation system, and new players will find a helpful walkthrough which helps them learn the mechanics wile also learning more about this new student they're creating and how they will interact with the setting. \nThought there are some classes which may seem familiar, Dark Places & Demogorgons  puts players in control of building the kind of group they want. Do you want to emulate \"The Nerd, The Princess, The Jock, The Basket Case, and The Criminal?\" Do you want to search for pirate gold while dodging criminals a booby traps? Maybe you just want to play games with your friends, but the new kid in town is really acting weird and messing up your plans. The stories are neverending...\n\nThe Fighter (Wrestler)\n\nBalancing the responsibilities of making it to practice, the pressures of the big game, and keeping up a social life, while still making time for school and family functions are just a few of the challenges characters may encounter in Dark Places & Demogorgons.\nThe Magician\n\nOthers must prioritize keeping up with their studies, not just reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also those of a more mystical nature they are just discovering. The pressures may be different, but their powers come from somewhere - if they can use magic, others can too.\nThere are often other odd occurances that can happen to characters as they grow older, some are completely normal and expected, and then there are...well...others that you won't find out about in your science text book...\nThe Teen Wolf\n\nStrange Things are Afoot...\nEvery town has it's stories, and everyone knows them. Some kids say that they're just things the grown-ups tell us to keep us out of trouble and away from places we shouldn't be. Other kids know better. \nRumors spread pretty quickly about weird things that happen in small towns. Whispers around the school, spooky stories around the campfire, or scary events on the outskirts of town your big brother or sister tells you happened to them and their friends. \nThe Haunted Car\n Dark Places & Demogorgons takes these urban legends and puts them at the forefront of your own stories. As you go about your lives, you realize that there may be more to these tales than others let on. As you play your sessions, you begin to uncover the mysteries about your town, and the truth about those trying to keep their secrets.\nThe Goatman!\n\nAnd more to come...\n\n\n\nShipping Information\nWe plan to release the digital version of Dark Places & Demogorgons in March 2021. We plan to release the physical version to our backers in April 2021, with the game being made available to stores soon after. We will use DriveThruRPG for all of our digital fulfillment.\n\nFor this project, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item. YOUR PLEDGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST OF SHIPPING.\nWe will be using BackerKit, a pledge manager, to collect information from backers.\n\nNOTE: The final cost of shipping may differ from our estimations, and there will be slight variation from country to country. We will also be charging applicable taxes based on your location.

With each one we have learned more about the industry and best practices. We are entering this project with the project almost completely designed, and developed, with only our final quantities left to nail down before sending to production. With the things we learned from previous projects, we are confident we can handle this project. Bloat Games brings a wealth of knowledge to this partnership as well, and we know we'll be able to make this project as good as it can possibly be.\n\nQ: How much of the books are already finished?\nA: The game is pretty much complete and ready to send to production. The text potentially added by stretch goals is not written yet, but the writers will be able to complete their portions quickly. Many of these adventure stretch goals are to be digital goals, potentially collected into another volume later, and will have no impact on the delivery of the main product.\n\nQ: Have you produced all these items before?\nA: Between Wet Ink Games, Bloat Games, and our production partners, all of these components have been made before and are well within our capabilities to produce using industry best practices.\n\nQ: What if shipping costs increase?\nA: Shipping costs are well beyond our control. We\u2019ve made our best projections and those shipping fees will be collected through Backer Kit. Once that money is in hand, we\u2019ll send the items, even it we end up eating a cost increase. Though we can make no promises about international shipping, we will always try our best to do right by our backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Wet Ink Games\n8 created \u00b7 0 backed\nWe are a small gaming company dedicated to bringing you new, fresh ideas to your tabletop before the ink dries.

In 1564, John Dee and Francis Walsingham convinced the Queen to pass an amendment to the Act \u2014 The Dee Sanction \u2014 permitting the practice of magic in defence of the realm.\nYou are an Agent of Dee; not out of choice, but out of some twisted sense of self-preservation. Somewhere between conscription and penance, you work for Walsingham and Dee to make amends, with a faint hope that you can use your talents to earn your pardon and absolution.\nYou can see the light at the end of the tunnel. If only you can outrun the shadows of your past and the horrors of the present\u2026\nThis is The Dee Sanction.\nThe Dee Sanction is a tabletop roleplaying game about serving Queen and country in the late Tudor period, in a time where kingdoms vie for power, the Church splinters under the pressure of reform, and creatures of folklore emerge from enforced hiding seeking revenge against those who imprisoned them.\nYou're a bad person \u2014 sentenced to hang for dabbling in magic \u2014 given a chance to redeem yourself and earn freedom in service to Queen Elizabeth's newest line of defence. \nLike The Cthulhu Hack, the system focuses on simple mechanics. A player rolls against one of three Resources \u2014 measured by a dice value for Physical, Intellectual and Supernatural \u2014 and hope to avoid a result of 1 or 2. The agent always succeeds in broad terms, but with a result of 1 or 2, they fail forward.\nThat means even a bad roll won't stop progress; it just means things might get a bit harder. That's the core of it, the philosophy that even in failure, the story should always be moving forward, even if it might tilt toward potential disaster in the process!\nThe campaign will fund a 60-page black-and-white illustrated compact book (A5, 148 x 210mm/5.8 x 8.3 inches), 95% written at the time the Kickstarter starts and tested over several years. You can find out more about the background and development of the game at The Dee Sanction blog \u2014 which will continue to expand and support the game.\nThe Character Sheet and the Core Book\nTwo-page spread from the current edit of the Core Book\nRecorded as part of Virtually Expo in August 2020, three fearless agents head into the unknown \u2014 south of Krakow, April 1585 \u2014 on the trail of a missing relic at the strange mercy of a blessed eyelash...\nBoth an interview and an actual play (starting at 32m 46s) as part of podcast Orlanth Rex's Gaming Vexes. We chat around the genesis and development of the game, before setting out to Deptford, 1593, in pursuit of a volume from Dee's lost library, The Book of Dead Names.\nOrlanth Rex's Gaming Vexes \u2014 Episode 8 \nAnd finally, an interview with Paul Mclean, of Yog-sothoth.com, was kind enough to interview me in January 2020 about the development, back story and future release of The Dee Sanction. Paul has kindly allowed me to host the interview, previously only available to Patrons via Patreon.\nThe core of the Kickstarter is the book, available in PDF (the Page), softcover (the Gentlefolk) and a cloth-bound hardcover version with a foil-blocked sigil of the Black Seal on the front (the Courtier).\nAll pledge levels with a physical book will also include a PDF, fulfilled through our web store at All Rolled Up.\nIn addition to the basic levels of book, both the Agent of Dee and the Favoured of the Queen pledge levels offer Kickstarter Exclusive rewards in the form of an All Rolled Up game roll. \nThe All Rolled Up game roll is a versatile, compact hobby wrap, that's way more than a dice bag; it can hold more than 100 polyhedral dice, plus up to 10 pens and pencils, as well as index cards or a small notepad.\nThese hand-crafted Kickstarter Exclusives feature special design features:\nthe Agent with closure strap complete with a metal buckle;\nthe Favoured with a crimson cord tie tipped with charms, representing elements of Elizabeth's elaborate outfit. The accessories and material of the game roll accentuate and mimic the Queen's dress design (see Update #22 for more pictures).\nSoftcover and Hardback covers (to be finalised)\nWork-in-progress printed fabric badge motif for All Rolled Up\nCharms adorning the ends of the cord tie on the I, Elizabeth ARU\nAfter the Kickstarter concludes, and the book is finalised, all physical rewards will ship. PDF copies will be available as soon as the book is completed. The PDF and softcover will be available on an ongoing basis through All Rolled Up. \nThe hardcover book is a Kickstarter exclusive, printed in limited numbers on a short run. Any not sold through the Kickstarter will be available through the All Rolled Up web store.\nThe campaign's core goal aims to bring The Dee Sanction to print with the artwork it deserves. Mindful that the book is almost complete, we're keeping any stretch goals simple \u2014 focusing mostly on enhancements and digital extras.\nThe book stands at 60-pages, illustrated with black-and-white full and half plate illustrations by Evlyn Moreau. The \u00a33,000 base Goal will fulfil the print run and pay for existing artwork.\nIf we achieve stretch goals, we'll add more art, more content and enhance the range of initial digital material available to support the game.\nAdditional PDF adventures and accessories will not delay the release of the physical content.\nBeyond the base Goal of \u00a33,000, stretch goals will add:\n More Art (\u00a34,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - We will add two additional full-page commission pieces by the talented Evlyn Moreau to the Core Book. This brings us to 62-pages.\n PDF Adventures #1 through 4 (ALL \u2014 UNLOCKED) - Over the course of playtesting the game, many adventures have been run, taking the Dee Sanction from the heart of the Ossulstone Hundred in the shadow of the Tower to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in the wilds of eastern Europe.\n Longer Bestiary (\u00a36,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - The Core Book contains a two-page bestiary. At this stage, we will expand that count to four-pages in total. This brings us to 64-pages.\n Tudor Mini Guild (\u00a38,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - We will commission Evlyn to create twenty mini character portraits in the style of her Fabulous Mini Guild. All backers of virtual or physical product will receive a copy of the PDF version to print out or use online as tokens.\n Ossulstone Map (\u00a310,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - First glimpsed at Dragonmeet in 2019, the part of London at the heart of many Dee Sanction investigations is that which lies in the shadow of the Tower of London. A work-in-progress, at this level, all backers of virtual or physical product will receive a copy of the PDF version to print out or use online.\n Sanction Journal (\u00a311,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - The Dee Sanction encourages a play style that weaves tales across different dates, places and characters. Rather than restrict character information to just a sheet, a Sanction Journal - also known as a Book of Days - provides copies of the character sheet interspersed with a mix of gridded, lined, and dotted paper. All backers of virtual or physical product will receive a copy of the PDF version to print and use.\n More Art (\u00a314,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - As we've extended the bestiary, it's appropriate to add some creature images to the section. We will add two additional full pages to the book to include additional commissioned pieces by the talented Evlyn Moreau. This brings us to 66-pages.\n More Tables (\u00a316,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - The character generation system includes tables for generating occupation, association, focus and favours. We will add two tables, providing additional occupations and humours, which defines a possible quirk for your character (like the pre-generated characters used in the Actual Plays). This brings us to 68-pages.\n Wipe Character Cards (\u00a318,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - When we worked on The Cthulhu Hack we found that the option to have a dry wipe character card made sense for one-shots; an easy way to create and erase characters. We propose to create A5 dry wipe character cards (148 \u00d7 210 mm or 5.8 \u00d7 8.3 inches) for The Dee Sanction and include two cards with each physical reward level. Also, we will add the option to buy a pack of 10 as an Add On.\n PDF Adventure #5 (\u00a320,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - What's a wooden rammar and how did John Dee hurt his left shin on the sharp small end of it at four o'clock in the afternoon today (or possibly tomorrow \u2013 he isn't certain) in 1592? If we hit \u00a320,000, I'll write an adventure that explains (or at least considers) Dee's shin injury.\n Mystery Final Stretch Goal (\u00a330,000) - Dee's interminable quest, persevering in contempt of all reason, always pushed him onward. Who knows what esoteric wonders might await should such lofty heights be attained?\nSouthwark and The Dee Sanction\nAll physical items that require shipping can only be added to reward tiers that already include physical rewards.

The following chart provides an estimate of shipping costs by various regions.\nIf you're unsure about potential shipping costs, please don't hesitate to contact us through Kickstarter \u2014 or you can get an approximation of likely costs through the All Rolled Up web site, in terms of add-ons and extras.\nAll shipping estimates are based on current standard rates (late 2020) and may be subject to change in the time before fulfilment of the project.\nYou can use the Shopping Cart/Basket at All Rolled Up to get a rough idea of total shipping.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady?

Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Matt, Sigrid and Charlie leave the safe harbor of the enclave for an expedition onto the wastelands of the surface world. During their journey they are forced to confront dark secrets from the time before civilization\u2019s fall.\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag is the internationally acclaimed author, concept designer and artist behind Tales From the Loop, Things From the Flood and The Electric State. His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world.\nNow, St\u00e5lenhag turns his unique vision to a dystopic future in a new narrative artbook: The Labyrinth. With your support, these amazing images will turn into a top-quality narrative artbook, truly doing justice to the extreme attention to detail and quality of St\u00e5lenhag's work.\nSpread from the Labyrinth\nSpread from The Labyrinth\nJust like Tales From the Loop and Things From the Flood and The Electric State, The Labyrinth will be a thick, oversized artbook of over 150 pages with print, paper, and binding of the highest quality.\nThere will be two versions of the book - the Standard Edition (included in the STANDARD reward level) and the Limited Edition (included in the LIMITED reward level and above).\nThe Limited Edition, with an exclusive and beautifully embossed cloth cover, is unique to this kickstarter and will never be printed again.\nLimited Edition (Work in Progress)\nSpread from The Labyrinth\nLabyrinten kommer \u00e4ven att publiceras p\u00e5 svenska.

His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian and American landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world. Tales From the Loop was ranked one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias\u201d by The Guardian, along with such works as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nIn 2019 his book The Electric State was shortlisted for the Arthur C. Clare Award and the Locus Award. His first book, Tales From the Loop, was adapted into a tv show on Amazon Prime in 2020. \nClick here to stay in the loop on all of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s projects in English.\nF\u00f6r mer information om Simons svenska b\u00f6cker och spel klicka h\u00e4r.\nPhoto: Fredrik Bernholm\n\n\nThe Labyrinth will be a top-quality artbook no matter what, with paper, printing and binding of the highest grade. The illustrations and the story form a unified work of art, that will not easily benefit from expanding. This means that this Kickstarter will not have a large number of stretchgoals, as we have a very clear vision for this book and we will not compromise on it in any way.\n\n\nUNLOCKED! Stretchgoal 1: Special Cloth Spine\nWe will print the book with a special cloth spine with a beautiful printed floral pattern.\n UNLOCKED! Stretchgoal 2: Art Print 1 \nWe will print a separate high quality art print of one of the images in The Labyrinth. The print will have roughly the same size as a page in the book.

We are heirs to their unseen empires, and our lives are built upon their ashes.\nWorlds Without Number is a tabletop fantasy role-playing game from the creator of the hit sci-fi game Stars Without Number. It's built from the ground up to provide gritty, hard-edged adventure in the fathomless future of the Latter Earth, a fantastic realm of time-lost sorcery, savage foes, and barbaric splendor. The cold steel in the fists of your heroes and the half-understood sorcery in their tomes must suffice to overcome the monstrous remnants of ancient alien rulers and the present depredations of ruthless lords and hideous beasts alike. The riches of lost ages await in the subterranean Deeps that once held their kingdoms, and even the heavens above are not beyond the reach of the recklessly daring.\nWorlds Without Number and its fantasy tools are built to be fully compatible with the sci-fi gaming of Stars Without Number and other OSR games, using classic old-school mechanics such as the traditional six attribute scores, hit points, AC, classes, and levels, along with certain modifications and refinements meant to accommodate more modern tastes. This traditional gaming chassis ensures that you can plunder almost fifty years of adventures, games, and other content built for those specifications and take advantage of the wealth of modern material being written for old-school game mechanics. An excerpt of the rough beta character creation, rules systems, and magic chapters is available right here for the curious.\nYet Worlds Without Number is built for more than just OSR enthusiasts. More than half the entire book is devoted to system- and setting-neutral tools for developing fantasy campaign worlds and sandbox adventures. Just as with the award-winning Stars Without Number ruleset, the game is designed for the working GM, someone who wants to forge their own worlds and fashion their own adventures with the most effective tools they can get. While the Latter Earth is provided as the default setting for the game, Worlds Without Number is designed to give you tools that work with the fantasy setting and game system of your choice, whether it's an existing world or a work of your own creation.\nSo what's in the book? In the system-specific portion of the book, you'll get everything you need to play classic fantasy adventurers in an untamed realm. Old-school character creation rules and classes, the unique talents and knacks of Foci, traditions of High Magic and stranger sorcery to fuel occult character concepts, and crisp, clean system mechanics that are familiar to many but refined with practical experience. GMs will get a sheaf of monstrous foes and eldritch treasures to cast about their world, and everyone involved can confidently play out a broad range of fearless heroics with nothing more than the core book in hand.\nYet the real treasures of Worlds Without Number lie in its mighty tools of crafting and artifice, implements that have been tuned carefully to assist a GM in creating their own settings and their own exciting adventures. These system-neutral tools are built specifically to help GMs of any fantasy game system or setting turn their imaginings into playable content.\n Factions for running setting-level political struggles and background conflicts, the better for giving your world life and motion beyond the PCs' own activities\u2026 and when the time comes, the heroes can join the intrigue and conflict as well.\n Major project guidelines and rules, because heroes think big and want to leave their mark on a setting. These rules help you translate the ambitions of your PCs into specific adventures and goals, giving them concrete progress toward their ends and providing the GM with a rich source of adventure grist.\n Setting creation tools for sandbox GMs, walking you through the steps for creating the content you need to run a smooth, enjoyable sandbox campaign. You'll build the parts that matter with tools that help you all the way, letting you focus your time and effort on playable material that your players will enjoy at the table.\n Tags for scheming Courts, raucous Communities, perilous Ruins, and trackless Wilderness are provided, each one providing ideas and outlines for turning tropes into playable content. Those who enjoyed the hundred Tags provided in Stars Without Number will savor the two hundred fantasy Tags provided here.\n Adventure creation tools are there as well, because it's not enough to just tell a working GM to make something up. That work you did in building your setting and giving Tags to your creations is leveraged to speed and smooth the creation of a good evening's play, with tools for creating combat, exploration, investigation, and social challenges, along with guidelines for stitching them together into adventures. Whether a Deep-crawl through abandoned tunnels or a treacherous game of ducal intrigue, these tools will help a GM create something playable.\nWorried about finding people to play? Just like Stars Without Number, Worlds Without Number will be provided in a free edition as well, one containing all the above tools and giving curious players one easy download for getting into the fun. But what bonus material is going to exist in the deluxe edition offered here?\n Legates, and the epic-level heroism of these legendary figures. Fueled by the eldritch power of the Legacy, these rules let you play high fantasy heroes with tremendous powers and fearsome prowess. GMs who want to run epic fantasy from the start can use these tools to change the tone of their campaign from gritty fantasy to mythic might.\n Additional classes for PCs who want more finely-tuned mechanical representation of certain concepts. The classes are written to fit into the default Latter Earth setting, but each of them is built to provide support for classic character concepts, whether shape-shifting hero, swashbuckling duelist, mind-bending mentalist, armored war-priest, or hero with a loyal animal companion.\n Extraplanar worlds, with GM tools for building alien realms of strange entities and fearsome perils for the heroes to explore or reckless sorcerers to summon forth. Whether a pocket Iterum of the Latter Earth or the native realm of the devils you need for your own campaign, you can use these tools to build what your world needs.\n One Roll Tables for a number of topics relevant to a GM's interests. Stymied and in need of inspiration? Grab one die of each type, give them a toss, and stitch the results together into what you need.\nAside from these additions, I'm saving some page count for what the backers themselves tell me they want to see. If your particular enthusiasm doesn't make it into the main book, I'll know about it for later consideration when putting together supplements and freebies for the game.\n This Kickstarter is to fund the printing of a Smyth sewn, full-color offset print edition of Worlds Without Number, along with the art costs involved in producing the book. The book will be a US letter-sized volume of about 350 pages, with the pages sewn into the binding rather than the usual print-on-demand glue. It will include printed endsheets and may involve other upgrades such as book ribbons depending on price and availability. Properly-printed books of this kind are much stronger and more durable than conventional POD glued-spine volumes.\nThis will be my second offset print project, after the successful and fulfilled Wolves of God KS, so I've already had some practical experience in handling this particular workflow. These offset books will be high-quality, sewn-binding volumes that may or may not be available after the campaign; I'm going to make the leftovers available for sale on Amazon and through my own website after all the backers have been fulfilled, but I can't guarantee how many extras may exist, if any. If you want one, this KS is the only sure way to get one.\nAll backers will receive immediate access to the beta draft PDF, with the Google Docs folder listed in the campaign's first backer-only update. The game is currently rough-draft complete and playable, so you can see from the first moment what kind of tools you can expect from it.\nPDF Only backers and all higher levels will receive a DRM-free PDF of the deluxe version of the book, issued as soon as the book is complete. This and all higher levels will also receive a PDF of the game's GM screen, formatted to fit in portrait-style screens.\nPDF Only+POD Coupon backers will get the PDF and a DriveThruRPG coupon allowing them to buy a print-on-demand print version of the game at its minimum print cost of about $25 plus shipping. I'm providing this option for backers in places where my own shipping is impractical, or those who want to check out the deluxe version without committing to the expense of a POD just yet.\nCredited PDF Only+POD Coupon backers will get the above, but will also get their name in the backer credits of both the PDF and the print versions. While I'd like to thank everyone in the credits, the page count required to add that many names at a visible type size is regrettably difficult to allocate.\nCredited PDF+Offset Print levels are available for several shipping zones, including US, UK, EU, CA, and Australia, and include the cost of shipping the book to you. These shipping costs range from $25-$30 depending on non-US location, unfortunately, but my experience in fulfilling Wolves of God obliges me to recognize this.\nThe mighty Sine Nomine PDF Omnibus level is offered for true fans who scorn mere material goods. This level includes not only a PDF of Worlds Without Number, but DriveThruRPG codes for every single for-pay Sine Nomine product I've ever written as of October 5th, 2020, an oeuvre that includes ten years worth of writing, seven complete RPGs, and 24 other books and supplements. Yes, the entire Sine Nomine catalog is yours at this level at a 25% discount plus the deluxe Worlds Without Number PDF and a POD at-cost print code. While I'm unable to offer discounts for those who already have some of the materials, you have my blessing to give your DRM-free extra copies to friends or interested bystanders.\nFor those who must have it all, the Sine Nomine PDF Omnibus+Print level has everything the PDF omnibus level offers plus an offset print book shipped to you. It's everything I have; I can give no more than this.\nThere are no stretch goals planned for this project. While I appreciate the marketing value of such additions, the successful RPG Kickstarters I've run in the past seven years have all been built around simple, specific goals and rewards. I'm but one man, and it would be reckless for me to promise dice, t-shirts, miniatures, commemorative plates, or other tat when what I'm trying to create is a single traditional book. I've been here often enough that I don't need to flail desperately to snatch every possible dollar in a single campaign.\nMuch as with my prior Kickstarters, all art I commission for Worlds Without Number will be released for free personal and commercial use by others, as I've paid the artists for full rights to the work.\nRPG enthusiasts have several reasons to back this KS and have confidence that the goods are going to be delivered.\nI've run seven successful RPG Kickstarters, taking in a total of $355,068 from almost ten thousand backers. Every single campaign fulfilled on time or early. I have never been late with a Kickstarter reward, let alone failed to provide it. My Kickstarters are proverbial in their regularity, efficiency, and speed of delivery. My latest KS, Wolves of God, was my first foray into offset printing. The COVID pandemic hit in the middle of its final prep, it lost a printer the first time it went to press, and it still delivered two months before the due date.\nMy games pull players and GMs. By comparing the number of for-pay deluxe downloads with the number of free downloads of my products on DriveThruRPG, I can get a good idea of how many curious free-version downloaders turn into deluxe-edition buyers. As a result, I can see that as many as 1 in 4 of the free version downloaders decide it's worth paying me $20 for the full version of Godbound or Stars Without Number. This kind of support is tremendous, and shows just how widely-useful these games are to GMs.\nI write for working GMs. I write every one of my games to be as useful as possible to as wide a range of readers as I can, whether or not they're going to use the system or the setting. The system-neutral tools I design are built to generate actual, playable content and smooth the rough edges of GM prep work for any game set in the same genre. I support and encourage GMs toward using the systems and settings they like best, so I have a large percentage of faithful customers who buy my books purely for the toolsets I provide within.\nFinally, see for yourself whether the game offers the tools and materials you can use. The rough beta is waiting for you in the link in the first backer-only update. You don't have to wonder if the game suits your needs; you can pledge and find out this minute.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've completed seven on-time, successfully-delivered RPG Kickstarters over the past several years, so I know a great deal about what can and might go wrong with the process. My workflow for KS production includes numerous precautionary measures to absorb the inevitable setbacks, complications, and mishaps that always attend any major project. One of the most important measures is a clearly-stated policy on what constitutes \"failure\" for this Kickstarter and what will happen if that failure occurs. While none of my campaigns have ever been late or failed before, a failure plan is the sort of thing that needs to exist before it's actually needed.\n\nIf all promised rewards for this Kickstarter are not either fully delivered or actively in the process of shipping by one year after the promised Kickstarter delivery deadline, or if my death or other complete incapacitation occurs before the project is complete, this Kickstarter will be considered to have failed and the following procedures will go into effect.\n\n* All available work will be released as-is in PDF form to backers in whatever state it exists in.\n\n* A rendering of accounts will be presented on the project, including monies spent on art, printing, shipping, labor, taxes, and all other expenses by category, and an explanation will be given as to why it is economically or physically impossible to complete the project.\n\n* The remaining funds will be returned pro-rata to backers, assuming any funds remain and the refund amounts are large enough to bear the transaction costs.\n\nOne of the major selling points of this campaign is the offer of an offset-print, Smyth sewn hardback book for backers. These books are much more durable than conventional glued-spine POD books, and I ran an earlier Kickstarter campaign, Wolves of God, chiefly to gain experience and contacts for successfully executing a print job like this. Despite the plague striking in the midst of the print project, I successfully shepherded it through and got the books sent to backers in September.\n\nI expect to do the same this time around, hopefully with the absence of a pandemic. Even so, there is a non-trivial chance that the situation will conspire to defeat the print run. The printers used will be US-based, to avoid tariff or domestic delivery uncertainties, but some unforeseen disaster may ruin a print run, drive prices to infeasible levels, or otherwise prevent an offset print run from happening.\n\nIn such a case, print-level backers may be obliged to accept POD copies in lieu of offset print ones. If it is economically feasible I will endeavor to refund some portion of their pledge in that case, but since the only situation where such a course would be contemplated is one in which multiple disasters have already happened, this project may not have the money to offer such refunds.\n\nI have planned the pledge levels on a worst-case basis, assuming that the offset print books won't actually be any cheaper than the POD standard-color books. Granted a print run of a few thousand, they should in fact be much cheaper, so much so that I can afford to do a second print run if the first is somehow lost or ruined, though this would likely add several months to the delivery.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "PDF Only", "descp": "Get a DRM-free PDF from DriveThruRPG when the book is complete, a PDF of the print-for-yourself GM screen, and get access to the rough beta immediately.\nINCLUDES:\nDRM-free PDF\nGM Screen PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}], "stat": ["1,333 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "PDF+POD Code", "descp": "Get a DRM-free PDF and a code that will allow you to order a POD print copy from DriveThruRPG at-cost plus shipping.\nINCLUDES:\nDRM-free PDF\nAt-cost POD Code\nGM Screen PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}], "stat": ["1,113 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Credited PDF+POD Code", "descp": "Get a DRM-free PDF and a code that will allow you to order a POD print copy from DriveThruRPG at-cost plus shipping.

Set on a train, this adventure is fast paced with deadly combat encounters with orcs and their alchemically altered abominations.\nThere is no set map.

One of them was my husband, and very familiar with DCC and Hubris, one was new to Hubris but has played and even ran DCC, the third was new to DCC but signed up because he wanted to beat up on some orcs. Once I explained the scenario and started laying out the cards everyone was super excited to see what this train was going to offer them adventur wise. No sooner had I explained the set up than the first ambush of Orcs happened. Three orcs burst onto the train car and I just about had a TPK on the first encounter. Two of the body's had to be rolled, but luckily all survived, even if it was just by a hair (I gave my druid lay on hands because there was no healing otherwise and I wanted to give them a fighting chance at least). They explored the cars that were dealt, met the Gunslinger (the new class introduced in Orcs), made some terrifying discoveries, and eventually made their way to the front of the train. having had such a brutal first encounter, I didn't follow the recommended attack order for the big bad, instead I started him off with just his claw attack. My druid had other plans though, he decided he was going to shape shift, Rolled enough he could shift into a dinosaur, at which point my husband shouts, he could be a velociraptor shaman (a player class from Dinosaur Crawl Classics which I had run earlier in the weekend). At this point the table was all about this happening and since it was a one shot I totally allowed it (at least there will be stories...haha). At this point it was time for another monster attack, which of course missed, and this is where all hell broke lose. My newly formed shaman, put a spell on his spider George, which allowed George to pull of an attack that very nearly killed the monster. The monster on his next attack targeted George because he damned near killed him and finished off our spider friend. The rest of the group backed off and the alchemist hurled a bomb at the monster finishing him off. The adventure ended with our druid, deciding he wasn't thrilled with discoveries he had made on the train, bid the party adieu and headed off to distant lands (I'm sure he'll be fine). I love that Orcs will change every time I run it, depending on what cards get laid out. The players enjoyed the ride, and while I did let it get a little (ok a lot) crazy at the end, the adventure was a fun and memorable experience for all.\" -Sarah Brown\nWriting, Publisher, Directing, and all Around Awesome Person: Me\nProofreading: Fiona Geist and Jarrett Crader\nLayout: Jez Gordon and Matt Hildebrand \nArtists: Alex Mayo, Angie Groves, Carmin Vance, David Lewis Johnson, Gennifer Bone, Mike Faille (cover) and Sonya Prince! \n$8,000- Increased Print Run!

Your training at Farrador Keep has come to its end. You are now a fully fledged adventurer ready to make your name known in all the lands. However, this time, you will go it alone. Farrador is a relatively peaceful region; however, menacing monsters reside in the shadows of even the brightest lights. You are being called to explore abandoned mines, save villages from devastating foes, and claim your name as the next true adventurer. All this and more will be possible as you go Into the Unknown!\nInto the Unknown is a true solo adventure for characters level 1-5 for 5e, B/X, or Swords & Wizardry!\nArtwork by Francesca Frisinelli\nTrue solo modules are just that... solo. These books are designed to be played by a single player using the 5th Edition, B/X, or Swords & Wizardry systems. If you have ever read a Pick-a-Path, Choose Your Own Adventure, or Endless Quest book, you will feel right at home with Into the Unknown. These adventure campaigns are designed in that way where you choose your own fate as you decide where to go and what to do while adventuring through Farrador. You play your character and the monsters or encounters in which he or she explores. Gone are the days of wishing for a group to play with! Now your own fate is in your hands.\nThis book may also be run with one GM and one player. The text will be nearly flawless to play this way; however, the only real difference is the layout of the book does not follow traditional RPG books Pacesetter or other companies use when creating campaigns/modules. It does read like a Choose Your Own Adventure. For example, if you decide to go into the cave mouth, turn to page 23. If you choose to scout around the entrance first, turn to page 24. So on and so forth.\nA quick note from, me, the designer and project manager, Ben Barsh:\nI could not be more excited to bring this book to life. I have worked on many projects in my small career as designer; however, none have hit the nostalgia cord like this one. I began playing 1st Edition in my late middle school years (2011-ish). Other than small games with my father and at conventions, I was not exposed to a true campaign due to lack of a group. This problem was resolved through solo adventures. \nI immediately played through the first three solo modules my father wrote through Pacesetter. I believe I finished adventuring in 2 days (school got in the way). I sprinted downstairs after my final encounter and begged him for more adventure my 3rd level Ranger, Grimlon, could go on. He dusted off his old TSR solo adventures and off I was on my next great adventure.\nHere I am in 2020 having the honor of bringing this module to life. This campaign is truly special to me. I want to thank all of you for visiting this page and potentially backing. You are quite literally making a childhood dream come true.\nArtwork by Raven Evermoor\nThis book will include:\n64+ pages of adventure\nFull color interior (art and maps)\nNew Magic Items\nNew Monsters\nAnd more pending stretch goals!\nThe adventures you go on will take place in Farrador. This is a region of Dagmore (Ben Barsh's world being developed). This campaign is a sandbox solo story. You make your own decisions as you go, and they will lead you down different paths to the conclusion. As you can see by the map below, there are many areas to explore in Dagmore. Pending your decisions, you may even explore all areas!\nCartography by Raven Evermoor\nAdventuring solo is not an ordinary practice for many. It presents a different array of challenges that normal RPGs do not fall victim to. In an effort to quell the fire of uncertainty, Pacesetter has developed our SoloSystem\u2122 that is included in the beginning of every solo module we create. This outlines tips on how to adventure, rules to modify or keep in mind, and recommendations on how to go about mapping, resting, hirelings, experience, death, etc. We also introduce the idea of Adventure Points to help your character overcome great threats!\nYour character will start with a new \u201cstat\u201d called Adventure Points (AP). Your PC will have a number of APs equal to their character level: A second level character will start the game with an AP 2. Each time you gain a level, you add an amount of APs equal to your new level. For example, a second level character starts with AP 2. The adventurer advances to third level and gains 3 APs. If your character had not used any APs, they would now have a total of AP 5. APs are not regenerated by rest. When used, they are gone until you gain more by level advancement.\nAPs are used as a mulligan. If your character failed a specific die roll, they can spend one AP to change the die roll to match the desired/required result. This can be done for saving throws, attack rolls, skill checks, find a secret door, etc. Also, an AP can be used to grant a reroll at any time, such as damage rolls, hit point generation, etc. Furthermore, you can use an AP to alter a described result.\nThese tips and recommendations will be fitted for each game system. For example, experience does not function the same in 5e, B/X, and S&W, so we will have a section specifically designed for teaching you how to reward yourself experience.\n$15 Digital Defender - Single PDF - You will receive a PDF copy of Into the Unknown in 5e, B/X, or S&W. You will be able to choose the system when Backerkit goes live once the campaign ends. You will also receive any free digital stretch goals.\n$25 Softcover Savior - Single Softcover - You will receive a softcover of Into the Unknown in either 5e, B/X, or S&W.

You will also receive the three individual PDFs for each softcover book and the hardcover book PDF.\n200 Backers - Poster Map of Farrador! - (Unlocked!)\nWhen the project hits 200 backers, we will print and include a 17x11 folded poster map of Farrador with every book! This is absolutely FREE to all backers at a physical pledge or higher. This can be used while playing so you do not have to flip back and forth between pages or simply put in a frame for you to proudly display for guests!\n$3,000 - Pacesetter Character Sheets - (Unlocked!)\nThis stretch goal is absolutely FREE to all backers who back at least the PDF level. Once we have raised $3,000, we will add our character sheets to the appendix of the book or send them as a separate PDF. The 5th edition sheet was designed by Wonkee (our amazing interior artist and cartographer). They are an amazing addition to any campaign fueled by Pacesetter! The B/X and S&W sheets were designed by our fearless leader Bill Barsh!\nThere will be a separate character sheet for 5th edition, B/X, and S&W.\n$4,000 - More Art! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $4,000, we will add in 2 more interior pieces by the amazingly talented Raven Evermoor! These art pieces will continue to help bring the visual life to the book!\n$5,000 - Character Creation Section - (Unlocked!)\nThis stretch goal is absolutely FREE to all backers who back at least the PDF level. Once we have raised $5,000, we will add character creation charts for your use. These charts will be tailored precisely to the campaign that follows. There will even be recommendations on how to build characters for solo adventure! Your generated character will be ready for the adventure! The following charts will be available for your use: class, race, background, personality traits, flaws, and quirks.\nThere will be a separate character creation section for 5th edition, B/X, and S&W!\n* Note: The listed charts are subject to change before final layout. If you would like to recommend a chart, leave us a comment :) *\n$6,000 - More Art! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $6,000, we will add in 2 more interior pieces by the amazingly talented Raven Evermoor! These art pieces will continue to help bring the visual life to the book!\n$8,000 - New Subclass! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $8,000, we will publish the Elemental Ranger in the book as a new option for you to play! This is a new subclass of ranger that calls upon four of the natural elements of the world: fire, earth, water, and air. You may now use these forces to amplify attacks, defense, or tactical maneuvering.\nThis subclass will function more or less the same in each edition this book is being released for. Obviously the mechanics will be different; however, we will stay true to the original abilities and perks for becoming an Elemental Ranger.\nThe Elemental Ranger is woven into the unique lore of Farrador Keep, a college of sorts for those wishing to become adventurers. This subclass does not specifically given any sort of advantage over other during solo play, but it does give a unique twist that allows you to personalize your ranger more than ever.\nThis subclass will be available for playtest and review before the books are printed as long as there is interest! If there is interest in this, leave us a comment! If there is enough intriguing minds, we will release these early for you to try out!\n$10,000 - More Story! - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $10,000, I will write in another story arc for the campaign! As we know, your decisions in pick-a-path/solo adventure style books can take you anywhere. This stretch goal will add in more options of adventure. Think of it like a different branch has been unlocked! This will feature the same color maps and art used in the rest of the book. The adventure will remain levels 1-5, which makes it more re-playable.\n$12,000 - Another New Subclass! (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $12,000, we will publish the Path of the Ruinseeker Barbarian! This new subclass allows barbarians to harness the wild and untapped magic that lies within!\nFor 5th edition, this is quite simple. You will be able to choose Path of the Ruinseeker as your primal path at third level. This subclass will allow you to access the sorcerer spell list, cast spells while raging, and relentlessly cast allowing yourself to exchange physical exhausting for more spell damage (the latter two being unlocked at higher levels).\nFor B/X and Swords & Wizardry, we will be introducing the barbarian class as an option of play. Along with that, you will be able to choose to be the Path of the Ruinseeker. This will function similar in each edition allowing your barbarian to be opened to their primal magical nature. \nThe Path of the Ruinseeker Barbarian is woven into the unique lore of Farrador Keep, a college of sorts for those wishing to become adventurers. This subclass does not specifically given any sort of advantage over other during solo play, but it does give a unique twist that allows you to personalize your barbarian more than ever.\nThis subclass will be available for playtest and review before the books are printed as long as there is interest! If there is interest in this, leave us a comment! If there is enough intriguing minds, we will release these early for you to try out!\nArt by Francesca Frisinelli\n$14,000 - Alternate Ending - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $14,000, I will write in an alternate ending for this story! Since the ending will be relatively similar in each playthrough, I would like to add in another for those who are going to play the module more than once. This will also help keep the sandbox nature of the adventure rather than have the ending be on the railroad tracks (an inevitable feature of many RPG books). This ending will be woven into the fabric of the adventure as to keep the sense of the unknown alive!\n$22,000 - New Dwarf Playable Subrace - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $22,000, we will publish the Bijou Dwarf!\nThis new race of dwarves are close cousins those that reside within mountains. Once a sturdy, formidable people have now turned to the more elegant side of life. They found a wealth of gems and other minerals in their mines, and now they prefer to focus on the finer side of life.\nThe Bijou (bee-zho) are native Dun Bhuldar within Farrador. This makes them an amazing and seamless subrace to bring your adventure to life! They are naturally charismatic and openly welcome the presence of magic within their settlements. They are constantly looking to grow their wealth; however, they still do take care of others as they are constant donors to the less fortunate living within Lakeshire or other villages living in squalor. However, there are few that believe they should join higher societies of humans and elves in other lands.\nArt by Raven Evermoor\n$24,000 - New Finfolk Playable Race - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $24,000, we will publish the Finfolk!\nThe finfolk are a race of humanoid fish-like people that are natives to Starland Bay area in southern Farrador. Their communities are very welcoming and wise people that take in anyone that is in need. Originally, they were coastal settlers; however, some hungered for what the rest of the world had to offer, so they set out to explore what other settlements had to offer. Since then, they have been good neighbors and allies to those residing within Farrador. \nThe finfolk are natural hunters and/or healers. Since their settlements started out in recluse from conventional society, they have had to rely on themselves for survival. They are dexterous and wise, which many account to be the pinnacle of their survival. Being naturally amphibious creatures, they excel in water type scenarios as well.\nArt by Raven Evermoor\n$26,000 - Farrador: A History - (Unlocked!)\nOnce we have raised $26,000, the Farrador: A History add-on book will be available!\nThis book will encompass all the known history of Farrador and how this land came to be. It will include extra information on each settlement as well as the history of how it has come to the modern point in time where you are adventuring.\nIt will also include the new classes, subclasses, races, subraces, magic items, and spells that you can encounter during your adventures. This way if you would like to take these new goodies to a different campaign, you can do so without carrying around your copy of Into the Unknown. \nThis book will be a $10 physical add-on and a $5 PDF add-on through Backerkit post-campaign. It is estimated to be a 28 page, full color digest book.\nCover by Dmitry Yakhovsky\nAll digital rewards will be send via email after the Backerkit and production is completed. We will also be sending the PDF through Backerkit and DriveThruRPG! We will notify you by updating the Kickstarter when the emails have been sent.\nWhen the Backerkit site for this project is ready, you will receive an email.

Bill was a member of the Metro Detroit Gamers beginning in 1977 and assisted with running some the country's largest game conventions throughout the late 70s and early 80s including Origins (when it was held in Detroit). Bill also published the Deck of Many Things magazine throughout that era.\nBen Barsh started working at Pacesetter in 2015 and produced his first KS project, Rise of the Nefarious (a 5e mini-campaign) in 2018. Ben's title at Pacesetter is Operations Manager - that means he is the driving force behind how we get things done. His first major project, Rise of the Nefarious, was resounding success and ran flawlessly. He is also credited for Reaping at River's End and the Book of Beginnings, Pacesetter's most recent 5th edition products.\nFacebook\nWebsite\nTwitter\nInstagram", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any crowdfunding program, there is the risk of being late on delivery. This project is subject to various risks such as supplier failure, production company disruptions, and damages to books during the shipment process. Any and all prevention techniques will be implemented such as constant communication and updates, a strict and organized schedule, and working hard to be ahead of an unforeseeable curve to limit any issues that make come to be. In addition, to mitigate logistical delays we are using a US-based printer.\n\nWe also are aware of the negative impacts COVID-19 has brought to U.S. based businesses. We will continue to monitor the situation and work in accordance with local, state, and national safety procedures. We will work diligently to get ahead of our timeline so if the project is delayed due to COVID-19, we will have some buffer time. \n\nWith all that said, the rough design of this project is complete. We will have the manuscript edited and thoroughly playtested. Stretch goal artwork is either completed or in production. As the Kickstarter moves along, we will be posting sample pictures of the books and their content.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Our Gratitude", "descp": "No reward but our gratitude for supporting the project.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Defender - Single PDF", "descp": "You will receive a PDF copy of Into the Unknown in 5e, B/X, or S&W.

Though it's a full 298-page campaign setting, Dark Matter is designed with flexibility as a top priority: the rules and options in Dark Matter can seamlessly be applied to any 5E campaign from definitely-not-Star-Wars settings to all-inclusive fantasy games.\nConspiracy in the Stars! is a brand-new adventure for Dark Matter! Dive into the seedy underbelly of Port Nomad and unravel its mysteries in this 56-page neo-noir thriller. Designed for characters of 3rd to 5th level.\nThe starter kit contains everything you need to get started playing Dark Matter right away!

At the end of the campaign, you will receive a survey (via the pledge manager BackerKit) asking you to choose which add-ons you want for the extra funds you added.\n(You can also choose add-ons after the campaign, but pledging for add-ons during the campaign helps to unlock more stretch goals.)\nShipping for add-ons will be calculated on the BackerKit pledge manager.  \nHematite Dice from Level Up Dice\nWe\u2019ve partnered with Level Up Dice to make custom, handmade  Kickstarter-exclusive dice made from quality hematite, featuring a unique font and color, available nowhere else!\nDice Vault from Wyrmwood\nWe've also brought Wyrmwood on board for the perfect dice companion: an elegant, luxurious case, custom-engraved with the Dark Matter logo and made from fine wenge wood.

Plus, it comes with 30 1-inch scale ship tokens, so you can play out elaborate space battles with minimal setup, and without an expensive fleet of miniatures. When unlocked, it will be available as a digital + physical add-on for $25.\nUNLOCKED | In this new lighthearted campaign for Dark Matter, you play second-rate mercenaries working for a third-rate mercenary company, Grax\u2019s Guys for Cheap. As part of your contract, you take whatever nonsense oddball jobs come across your desk, and your boss, none other than Grax himself, has more than enough to keep you busy. Each chapter of this campaign functions as a slapstick one-shot, as you are recruited to some new, ridiculous job for yet another unstable client.\nThis campaign comes from the very same writers that brought you Conspiracy in the Stars!

You can enjoy easy reference for spells, familiars, and ship combat roles, while your GM can keep hazard cards near at hand, in case you fly too close to a star.\nUNLOCKED | In this new campaign, you play a team of mecha pilots for the Lakshay defense force. Fresh out of training, you\u2019re given your first assignment: hunt down one of your own. A legendary Lakshay pilot has turned cloak, going AWOL with his custom prototype frame, a cutting-edge mech of unsurpassed power. It\u2019s your job to hunt him down, and discover what infernal plot is brewing at the center of the Warzone.\nThe most elite Lakshay pilots, called Oni, are recognized only after one hundred confirmed kills. As you battle through the Warzone, you scratch tally marks on your frame, counting up your One Hundred kills, until you achieve the rank of Oni, or die trying.\nThis campaign has an all-star cast of writers on board, and will feature an entire set of rules to make your next 5e game a mecha thrill ride. When unlocked, it will be available in PDF as an add-on for $20.  \nUNLOCKED | This deck of 50 high-quality tarot cards contains beautiful illustrations on one side, and full monster statistics on the other.

It has all of the personality of our original ADV3NTURE Hoodie, which is the most funded hoodie ever on Kickstarter. But this one is better made, has a 5-year guarantee, and this guy's made right here in America! \nWe're back with TWO NEW HOODIES that are All-American. At ADV3NTURE, we launch our new products on Kickstarter because we love the community that we have built through crowdfunding. With the success our brand has experienced, we're back with hoodies that are more stylish, more comfortable, and have improvements to people's favorite innovations.\nTHE ADV3NTURE HOODIE and THE CLASSIC HOODIE are hand-crafted in America, from the ground up. It all starts with American cotton grown in North Carolina, zippers made in Georgia, and the final product being cut and sewn in California. Our new hoodies (and as of 2020, ALL of our  products) are made by hard-working Americans, like you.\nOur ADV3NTURE Hoodie brings back everyone's favorite features and innovations in a more refined and durable version of our original hoodie. It's designed to be your favorite everyday hoodie with comfort, stylishness and quality at the forefront. It has innovative construction elements, like a three-panel hood, over-locking seams, and our proprietary French terry loop fabric.\nOur CLASSIC Hoodie has the same silhouette as the new ADV3NTURE Hoodie, including the comfort, durability, and construction. We removed some of the innovations of from the ADV3NTURE hoodie. What we ended up with was a stylish, premium hoodie with just the right number of features and enough colors for every day of the week!\n The ADV3NTURE Hoodie and the CLASSIC Hoodie have the same dimensions and measurements and are made with the same fabric and materials. Below is a comparison of their features.\nWe are offering the ADV3NTURE and CLASSIC hoodies in EIGHT colors. There are no stretch goals, where we need to raise a certain amount in this campaign before they become available. ALL colors, named after California landmarks, are available once the campaign reaches its funding goal. At the end of the campaign, you will be emailed a survey (to the email associated with your Kickstarter account) where you'll tell us the color(s) and size(s) that you'd like us to send you.\nIf you'd like to add additional hoodies to your pledge once the campaign is over, you can do so easily in your survey. \nOur Catalina hoodie was inspired by the blue waters around Santa Catalina, an island off the coast of Los Angeles. One of California\u2019s Channel Islands, it's known for its wildlife, dive sites and Mt. Orizaba, its highest peak.\nOur Humboldt green hood was inspired by the green hills of Humboldt county, 270 miles north of San Francisco. Humboldt County is a densely forested region with nearly 1,500,000 acres of forest land and contains dozens of national, state, and local parks. They are also know for a particular green crop, but that had nothing to do with the name... we promise.\nOur Mojave color was inspired by the sands of Mojave National Preserve, the third largest of the America's National Parks. Singing sand dunes, cinder cone volcanoes, and a large Joshua tree forest are found within this 1.6-million-acre park. A visit to its canyons, mountains, and mesas will reveal long-abandoned mines, homesteads,  rock-walled military outposts, and an abandoned train depot.\nThis color was inspired by the wines of the Napa Valley, widely considered one of the top wine regions in the US. Visiting one of the valley's wineries every day would take over a year! More than four hundred wineries and grows many different grape varieties including Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Zinfandel, and other popular varietals.\nRising nearly 5,000 feet above Yosemite Valley and 8,800 feet above sea level, Half Dome is a Yosemite icon. This hoodie is a tribute to this impressive natural monument. Considered to be unclimbable in 1865, Half Dome was first summitted in 1875. The south face of Half Dome is now \"conquered\" by thousand of people every year.\nThis color was inspired by California's Lassen Volcanic National Park, home to steaming fumaroles, meadows freckled with wildflowers, clear mountain lakes, and numerous volcanoes. Jagged peaks tell the story of its eruptive past while hot water continues to shape the land. Lassen Volcanic offers opportunities to discover the wonder and mysteries of volcanoes and hot water for visitors willing to explore the undiscovered.\nThis hoodie is a tribute to the US Navy, which has a strong presence in California, and all branches of the military. Cheers to all of the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect our way of life! For all serving, and who have served, we greatly appreciate your service and sacrifice.\nThis hoodie is a tribute to Black Rock, a lava rock outcropping at the north end of Ka'anapali Beach. The Hawai\u2019ian name for Black Rock is Pu\u2019u Keka\u2019a, and ancient Hawaiians believed that this was the place where their spirits went to jump off to join ancestors forever. This color is also a nod to our friends at Maui Brewing Company, who have been supporters of Adv3nure since the beginning. We can't wait to have a beer with you soon! \nWe have always taken pride creating thoughtful innovations into our garments. Over the years, we have been refining and perfecting the features of our hoodies to make them streamlined and subtle. You'll find some of your favorite features in the descriptions below, as well as some of our developments in manufacturing, which make these hoodies better than any we have made.\nOur signature Beverage Pocket holds your drink, so you can keep your hands free to do other things. Hold your coffee while you walk to the dog and talk on the phone. Hold your beer while you hold your plate and a fork. Hold a baby bottle while you hold your baby. We're SURE you'll find plenty of uses for this pocket! \nOur Thumb-Hole Mitts have been a favorite feature of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie since the beginning! Unfold the cuffs to reveal the thumb-holes and enough material to keep your hands warm. Whether you use them as drinking gloves (to keep your beverage from warming up in your hands) or to keep your hands warm as the temperature drops, try them once and you'll be hooked!  \nBoth of our hoodies convert into pillows, a feature we find constantly useful. Simply roll them up into the Three-Panel Hood, which has been designed for the pillow conversion. Whether you're a passenger on a long car ride or want a place to rest your head while camping, the pillow conversion will be more convenient than you can imagine.\nThe Three-Panel Hood has been design to more comfortably fit your head. Rather than a one-piece hood where the fabric is bunched to create the shape of your melon, our three-panel hood uses three components to create an incredibly comfortable head covering.\nThe Passport Pocket lets you keep your valuable, like money, your ID, phone, or your passport close to your chest. The ZigZag stitching around the pocket holds the interior pocket in place, so the contents of your pocket stay secure.\nThe split Kangaroo Pockets are held in place by over-lock stitching and bar-tack reinforced edges to ensure their durability. The openings of the pockets are angled for maximum comfort as they hold your hands and keep them warm. \nInside the right kangaroo pocket is a hidden pocket inside to secure your valuable, like your keys, so they don't fall out while you're adventuring. It will give you extra confidence when carrying items around in your pockets. \nMost independent craft breweries (which we're fans of) are canning beer rather than bottling it, but as a throwback to the bottle-openers that we used to include in our hoodies and jackets, we're including this canvas bottle-opener PATCH (similar to the ones in our flannels), so you can twist off your bottle caps without damaging the French terry loop fabric. \n All of the zippers on the new hoodies are metal YKK zippers, the most durable, high-quality zippers available. And, they're made right here in the USA. This includes the main zipper on the ADV3NTURE and CLASSIC hoodies, as well as the zippers on the beverage pocket and passport pocket. \n We've added Elbow Pads to the arms of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie for added comfort, as well as to reduce wear on the area where your hoodie will come into contact with hard surfaces. They also add a bit of style to your hoodie, so people know you mean business. \n It's not quite as complicated as a GPS tracker, but our return home tag, and the honesty of a good samaritan should get your hoodie back to you if you happen to leave it on one of your adventures. It also contains our pledge to plant three trees with every purchase, including the hoodie you receive from this campaign.\nHere's a closer look!\n We've made sure that all of the stitching used in our hoodies keep your hoodie intact during your adventures. We use over-lock stitching on the top of the shoulders, so they lay flat, to make the seams comfortable if you happen to be wearing a backpack. \nWe\u2019ve spent nine months developing a unique fabric that we love. It\u2019s a high-density French terry fabric blend that is the best overall weight, and retains the its shape (being nearly shrink resistant), maintains durability, and is the optimal softness. \nOur hoodies start with raw cotton grown in North Carolina, where it is combed and spun in a yarn mill. The yarn is then transported to Los Angeles, where the yarns are knitted into our proprietary French terry loop. The fabric is then sent to our dye house, where the fabric blend achieves its subtle heathered appearance. It is then pre-washed (pre-shrunk) in our manufacturing facility. At that point, the fabric is inspected for any imperfections from the knitting or dying process. Once the fabric passes inspection, it is then ready to be cut and sewn into your new hoodie.\nKeeping our manufacturing domestic enables us ensure the highest quality of raw materials that are sourced for production, while allowing us to oversee the entire process to ensure high production standards through the entire process. We are also able to ensure that our high environmental standards are being maintained.\nHand-crafting our products domestically lets us keep jobs in the US, especially in a time where they\u2019re needed most. We are incredibly proud that all of our apparel is made by hard-working Americans.     \nBeing an environmentally conscious brand means we understand the importance of the environment and our affect on it. We are actively taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint by utilizing domestic raw materials and planting three trees to offset our environmental impact.\nThe \"3\" in our name represents the three trees that we plant with every purchase, including this Kickstarter campaign.\nTo find the size that best suits you, take your favorite hoodie and lay it on a flat surface. Compare the measurements of your hoodie with the measurements below. If washed properly (was cold and lay flat to dry) your hoodie should not shrink more than 1-2%. The polyester woven into the fabric maintains shape retention.\nIn addition to the standard sizes XS-2XL, we are offering BIG & TALL sizes. This includes TALL sizes in Large and X-Large, as well as 3X-5XL. These sizes require new patterns to be created, as well as extra fabric in the manufacturing, and extra shipping charges, due to the additional weight. If you order a BIG & TALL size, you will have to pay an additional charge when you receive your survey. Those ordering TALL sizes will be required to pay an additional $10. Those ordering 3X-5XL will be required to pay an additional $15.\nThe additional shipping charges added to your pledge for international orders does not include duties, taxes, customs VAT, or any other fees that may be charged by your country. Unfortunately, there are too many variables for us to properly calculate any additional charges. We are sorry for any inconvenience.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarter launches with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects and over $500M raised in total.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn\u2019t our first rodeo. Infact, it\u2019s our fourth. We launch our new, innovative products on Kickstarter because we love the community that we\u2019ve become a part of. We have an amazing customer service and fulfillment team. Shoot us an email (info@adv3nture.com) and we\u2019d love to answer your questions! We pride ourselves on open communication and thrive with input from our community. Please don\u2019t ever hesitate to reach out if you feel there is something we could be doing better! \n\nPlease note that it is VERY important that you fill out your survey as soon as you receive it. 1-2 days after the campaign is concluded, you will be emailed a link to a Kickstarter survey. If you don\u2019t, check your junk email folder or email us as we\u2019ll get it sorted out. In your survey, you\u2019ll provide us with your color choices(s), size(s) and address, so we know WHAT to send you and WHERE to send it. At the conclusion of the campaign, once the surveys are collected, we will be placing the order with our manufacturer. At that point, it takes about 60 days for the hoodies to be manufactured and mailed to you.\n\nWe have done this before and learned from the many challenges that we have encountered. We are confident that we will deliver these hoodies on time. Please be aware that if we are sending your hoodie(s) internationally, we will not be able to prepay the duties for international shipments, so you will be responsible for covering those charges. There are so many variables with international shipping that we are not able to accurately determine the duties and tax rates and pre-pay for every country, city, provinces, etc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "The CLASSIC Hoodie (Early Bird)", "descp": "Save $40 off the retail price of the CLASSIC Hoodie ($139) in your choice of color and size (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\nCLASSIC Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["238 backers", "Limited (12 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "The CLASSIC Hoodie", "descp": "Save $30 off the retail price of the CLASSIC Hoodie ($139) in your choice of color and size (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\nCLASSIC Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers", "Limited (126 left of 150)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 129 or more", "title": "The ADV3NTURE Hoodie (Early Bird)", "descp": "Save $60 off the retail price of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie ($189) in your choice of color and size (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\nADV3NTURE Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,405 backers", "Limited (20 left of 1425)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 139 or more", "title": "The ADV3NTURE Hoodie", "descp": "Save $50 off the retail price of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie ($189) in your choice of color and size (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\nADV3NTURE Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["50 backers", "Limited (450 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 189 or more", "title": "CLASSIC + CLASSIC", "descp": "Save $89 off the retail price of TWO CLASSIC Hoodies ($278) in your choice of colors and sizes (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 CLASSIC Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers", "Limited (5 left of 35)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 219 or more", "title": "CLASSIC + ADV3NTURE", "descp": "Save $109 off the retail price of CLASSIC + ADV3NTURE ($328) in your choice of colors and sizes (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\nCLASSIC Hoodie\nADV3NTURE Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["187 backers", "Limited (13 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 249 or more", "title": "ADV3NTURE + ADV3NTURE", "descp": "Save $129 off the retail price TWO ADV3NTURE Hoodies ($378) in your choice of colors and sizes (XS-5XL), hand-crafted right here in the US.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 ADV3NTURE Hoodie", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["328 backers", "Limited (22 left of 350)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Adv3nture Hoodie Shipping Update #9", "update_content": "It's been a month since our last update and unfortunately it has taken this long to get an update.

I have only tried it on and packaged it back up waiting for a response. Would you like to check it over to see it that is your normal sizing before we mover to a 3x? Please let me know what you would like me to do to work with you the best I can. Thanks again.

You\u2019ll be amazed at The Ecology of the Crater Mutant by Levi Combs (Planet X Games), astounded at the robotic mounts of S.A.B.L.E. Rangers by Mike and Elizabeth Stewart (Victorious RPG), and astonished at the malevolent diseases in Mutant Maladies by Skeeter Green (SGP Games). All that and a mini-adventure that\u2019s not-so-mini in Jim Wampler\u2019s The Gene Looms of Janeck-Vacca. \nBehold just a few of the tantalizing delights in SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1!\nAll That, Plus Regular Features\nSCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1 also includes ongoing features that will continue in every issue, with new mutations, new monsters, new artifacts, Retro Reviews of inspirational source media and material, and of course Scientific Comics right in the back!\nNot Just For the Radioactive at Heart\nSure, all this great new gaming material has been designed with the discriminating post-apocalyptic gamer in mind, but it is also eminently suitable for fantasy games \u2014 especially if your campaign needs a fresh jolt of excitement. In both the pulp literature that inspired our hobby and in the fantasy games of yore, many a magic item or monster turned out to have scientific origins. The contents of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN are ideal for getting seen-it-all done-it-all fantasy players back on their toes and engaged with new surprises. All material presented is useable with any d20-based game system.\nManifest of Wonders\nSCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1 will be a 6\u201d x 9\u201d digest-size square-bound book so it will look great on your shelf or slip easily into your game bag. Survey the table of contents for issue #1!\nHow to Pledge for Multiple Copies\nNeed to pledge for multiple copies of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1? Just select the pledge level for the PRINT + PDF and fill out the dollar amount in multiples of $15 (i.e., $30 for two copies, $45 for three copies, etc).\nRetailer Pledge Level\nEspecially in these trying times, we support all our brick-and-mortar game stores. If you are a retailer and wish to pledge at the Retailer Pledge Level, all we ask is that you send us verification via email or messages after pledging.\nShipping Costs\nEach book will be shipped to backers USPS First Class in a sturdy cardboard envelope. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE LEVELS. Shipping and handling is an economical $5 per book shipped. Retailer shipping will be via Media Mail and is also only $5.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY, so please pledge accordingly. Current International shipping costs are so high that shipping outside the USA is not feasible for Mudpuppy Games at this time. We know that sucks, but much larger companies with better resources than us have struggled with this and failed. Plus we just can\u2019t bring ourselves to charge shipping costs in excess of the price of the product itself, and for that philosophy we can only apologize in advance.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nThere aren\u2019t any! We\u2019re not fooling around here. The entirety of funds raised for this project are being devoted to creating one of the best new gaming zines around. They say \u201cContent is King\u201d, and that axiom is our guiding principle at SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN.\nADD-ONS\nDid you miss out on any of our prior projects? We got you. To add-on any of the following items, just increase your pledge level dollars by the amounts listed below, then when your backer survey comes at the end of the kickstarter note which items you want in the add-on question/text field.\nYou can add-on any of our last three successful kickstarter projects.\nThe shipping costs for add-ons depends on how many books you add. Up to three books total (including your print copy of SCIENTIFIC BARBARIAN #1) can be shipped at a combined cost of $5. More than 3 books total have a combined cost of $7. Any reward with multiple books added on will be shipped Media Mail. Because of the differences between First Class and Media Mail, the MHH dice set do require an additional $5 shipping and handling charge if added on.\nCheck This Artifact ($15)\nCheck This Artifact contains 30 brand-new artifacts of the Ancient Makers, plus a full write up of a new godlike AI and its neural programs (spells), all for use in any d20-based post-apocalyptic role playing game or genre-mash fantasy role playing game.\nDigest 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover, 60 pages\nFight This Mutant ($20)\nFight This Mutant contains over 30 brand-new mutant monsters and races, a whole new Ancient Alliance your player characters can join or fight, a brand-new character class \u2014 the Technomancer, and 15 new neural programs (spells) from 1st through 5th levels. Usable in any d20-based post-apocalyptic or genre-mash fantasy role playing game.\nDigest 6\u201d x 9\u201d softcover, 120 pages\nMutant Murder Hobo Dice ($15 + $5 shipping)\nMutant Murder Hobo Dice set includes 4 glow-in-the-dark d20s, each in a different color: Uranium (green-white), Plutonium (purple), Cobalt-60 (blue), and Thorium-G (orange) all light-shielded in a plush black velvet dice bag with embroidered MMH logo in gold.

Every challenge meaning death, or something worse. It is there she found THE SCRIPTURES OF THE WORM: promising power eternal and the bond of the Grub. She followed them to what we now call her Throne; this stronghold is the only thing between humanity and the scourge of the Doombringer Moth.\u201d -- Some future historian on the God-Queen\nRUN! RUN! RUN! (and grab your pig)\nWhat is 2 WORM 2 FURIOUS?\nA deadly funnel that revolves around an ever mutating and evolving moth grub. You\u2019ll want 4-6 players, 15-20 level 0 characters, as it\u2019s a funnel, but it works for levels 1+ (the worm adapts; don\u2019t worry). \nTHE grub has escaped and you have been charged by the God-Queen to bring it back to the hatchery, but this is a funnel after all\u2026 so stuff will inevitably go wrong and will likely be fatal.\nThe worm grows and grows and grows and grows. The growth unlocks new abilities for the worm grub, ranging from taking a snooze, to spraying caustic acid.\nIts mutations don\u2019t stop until it cocoons and becomes the Doombringer Moth. Scales will fall from its hallowed wings, and the god rays will immolate the kingdom.\nIt will be an A5 Hardcover with Art by Scrap Princess! (over a dozen pieces!). It is currently hovering around 68 pages before layout and final editing.\nAs a player you\u2019ll be trying to get the Worm / Grub / Juvenile Moth back to the hatchery. You will likely die, be sacrificed to the worm, fall into a sinkhole, or be trampled\u2026 because it\u2019s a funnel.\nAs a Judge you\u2019ll be harnessing the raw power of the grub as it mutates, and changes forms\u2026 until it becomes the kingdom shattering Doombringer Moth (unless the players stop it first). You also have access to the royal guard, the knightly orders, the worm-locks and worm-hawks, as well as some encounters.\nIt is also a setting that you could easily hack this into your own settings and games. Add the worm anywhere, use the God-Queen as an npc, or modify your fighter classes to be like the Knights and Sky Knights. Or just pull out the worm-hawks for use as mounts for your home game.\na quick mockup render via Glynn @ MonkeyBloodDesign\nWhat is Dungeon Crawl Classics?\nDungeon Crawl Classics is a roleplaying game designed and published by Goodman games. It's a combination of classic Appendix N (Conan, Solomon Kane, Lovecraft) goodness, alongside all the things you'd expect in other classic roleplaying games. It has a heavy emphasis on Sword and Sorcery, and you're just as likely to be casting spells and watching your body mutate, as you are to knock a cyclops off a cliff to dam a river. (or in this case, being fed to a burgeoning worm deity)\nAnd even if you don\u2019t play (or own) DCC, it still has HD, and AC and stuff you\u2019d find in other OSR, and D20 systems! (it would also work for a certain fifth edition game; it definitely would) \nthe grub that grew up\nSo what\u2019s inside?\n A Funnel: this is how adventurers are forged. Just bring the grub home, how hard could it be?\n Locations: be it a Tavern, cemetery, farm, or temple.\n Encounters: worm-hawks, rioting villagers, and sinkholes.\n The Worm: how it grows and mutates; acts and reacts. The effects it has on the populace around it.\n New Occupations: barge tenders, swamp witches, scribes, butchers, and more.\nNew Bestiary Entries\n The Villager: pitchforks and scorn\n Knights of the Forgotten Silk: Warhammer wielding devotees to the grubs; they cast nets to snare their prey. In death they leave a surprise.\n Worm-Locks: guardians of the grub that take vile trophies and read the word of the worm.\n Sky-Knights of the inverted grub: the god-queen\u2019s royal guard; they patrol the skies on their steeds, leaping to the ground to finish whats their javelins don\u2019t.\n Worm-Hawks: ospreys? Pangolins? What are they? Ravenous \u201cbirds\u201d with 20 foot wingspans. They feast on worm flesh.\n Bandits & Stilt-Walkers: Need to have something to keep your eye on in the village. Why not a spectacle?\nSome important NPCS\n Serena, The God-Queen: SHE who commands this kingdom.\n Eirny Just, Tavern Owner: a retired sky-knight that would rather see the god-Queen dead.\n Pangolust XVIII, ????: worm-hawk breeder that believes herself to be the only one that the god-queen needs.\n Selenium Gellar, \u201cThe Jester\u201d: serves as the eyes of the moth-bound; they will rise again.\nMoth Clerics or are they Worm-Locks? I don't know\nNew Patron or Deity?\n Invoke Patron: create dust holograms, make all you gaze upon fall asleep, and harness the god lights.\n Spellburn: runes begin to burn, and your fingers turn to nails.\n Patron Taint: become as a moth, and watch your body deform.\n New Canticles: apply runes to friends as mana batteries and call down sub-orbital lasers.\n New Divine Favors: ever want to cocoon yourself? or sprout wings?\n New Portents of the Worm-God: grubs bursting from the seams, teeth falling out, clouds of moths\u2026 you know the usual.\nOther Stuff?\nDid we say magical rune-marks?\nA Worm Tracker (handy reference for the die chain)\nLedgers to keep track of people and kingdoms crushed by the grub-god\nWe've also tried to add as many tables as possible; as DCC intended.\nThe Cocoon\nWho are we?\nOrbital Intelligence is designer, producer, and publisher of tabletop game content, based out of Seattle, WA.

Now, we're back with a new book: Classic Monsters.\nClassic Monsters is designed to support and enhance your Black Hack games. It features over 200 monsters, drawn from B/X and First Edition sources of the The World's Most Popular Fantasy Role Playing Game, all converted for use with The Black Hack.

As far as any of the regional layfolk are concerned, they live on the edge of the world, and all manner of horrors spawn in the shadow of the mountains beyond. There was a time when the people of Stennard may have traveled further west, closer to the rising rock face, but any roads that once were have long since been taken back by nature, with nothing more than deer paths remaining.\nThe growing season in this region has seen a glut of torrential rains that have damaged and spoiled the crops. This outlier town has few trading partners, and the neighboring towns are suffering the same fate. The townsfolk need to do something to ensure their citizenry have enough in their stores to survive the coming winter. A small band of Stennard\u2019s most prolific hunters and gatherers agreed to press into the forbidden lands to the west and did not return. Desperate, a call was sent out to all of the neighboring towns: \u201cCome to Stennard! We are offering a reward to find our missing sons and daughters.\u201d\nCover layout may differ slightly from what is pictured. Cover art by Matt Stikker.\nA 0-Level Funnel for DCC RPG\nThis dungeon adventure was designed to be run as a 0-level \"funnel\" for DCC RPG. For those unfamiliar with the concept, each player starts with three or four 0-level peasants who must survive on their wits alone, because they have not yet blossomed into full adventurers with skills and abilities. At the end of the adventure, each player may have one or two survivors who become the adventurers they were destined to be! This adventure plays best with 12-16 0-level characters. (Note: If you play one of the many OSR systems available, you can easily port this over for 5-8 1st level characters.)\nThe Goal\nWe feel we are almost ready to send this project to the printer. The writing is just about complete and it could use a couple more passes of editing. We've spent the last two years curating interior art from Rich Sampson (@artofnerdgore), Mike Tommyrot (@miketommyrot), Sam Alcarez (@samalcarez), and cover art from Matt Stikker (@bargainbinblasphemy). We'd like to fill it out with a few more pieces and we'd like to procure higher quality cartography if possible, but most importantly, we'd like to get this adventure into the hands of DCC RPG fans everywhere.\nLeft to right: Matt Stikker (@bargainbinblasphemy), Sam Alcarez (@samalcarez), Rich Sampson (@artofnerdgore), Mike Tommyrot (@miketommyrot)\nTwo Years of Play Testing\nOver the last two years the adventure has been run over a dozen times across various conventions such as Cyclops Con (2020), Midwinter (2019 & 2020), Dan's Con of the Vale (2019), AdeptiCon (2019) and events additional events at Board Game Barrister and Noble Knight Games (Free RPG Day 2019) by myself and local hero, Jim Meyers. With each play through the content has been tweaked and revised. Though there have been no TPK's (total party kills), the character pool has proven to be suitably funneled down to a handful of characters consistently. \nAdditionally, though it plays well in a convention environment, it is an introductory adventure that introduces a number villains who may survive making a great launching point for a campaign.\nAdventure Highlights\nThis adventure has eight named NPCs with stats, descriptions, personality traits, and motivations. The Introductory scene has 20 possible rumors and opinions  for an inquisitive party to gather information from. Split into three acts, the adventure has over 20 potential scenes and encounter areas to explore, combining wilderness set pieces and dungeon encounters.  \nSample images from Rabid Dogs Zine.\nThe Precipice of Corruption and Rabid Dogs Zine\nDuring Zine Quest 2 we funded Rabid Dogs Zine, a 32 page zine full of rules I use at my own table. Rabid Dogs Zine is a 8.5\"x5.5\" sized DCC compatible fanzine with a new occupation table, rules for using any traditional character race in combination with any class, two new character classes, the Outlier and the Canine. and for Judges, two Roadside Encounters, with one that is directly connected to the story line of The Precipice of Corruption. \nWhy DCC?\nI started playing D&D in 1981 with the Tom Moldvay Basic Set and B2 Keep on the Borderlands. I lived and breathed D&D, AD&D, and 2nd Edition AD&D for over a decade, but I discovered miniature wargaming in the mid 90s and somehow I lost interest in RPGs for the next 15 years. Then something happened. I got the itch again for a half dozen people to crowd around a table to share in a story together. I dabbled in Warhammer Fantasy Role-Play, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and even 5th Edition D&D. None of these systems gave me the experience I was looking for. Enter DCC...\nIt's 2018 and I discover a system that touted itself as \"D&D like it's 1974 again...\" and the aesthetic just called out to me. Later that year I was gifted the full rule book and it unlocked the neural pathways I had of memories from when I first fell in love with D&D in 3rd grade. Over the next month I wrote the first draft of this project and ran it for some of my close friends and they seemed to really enjoy it. Bolstered by their enthusiasm, we took it to the streets!\n What is Dungeon Crawl Classics? \nGlory & Gold Won by Sorcery & Sword\nYou\u2019re no hero.\nYou\u2019re an adventurer: a reaver, a cutpurse, a heathen-slayer, a tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets. You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. Adventure as 1974 intended you to, with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery.

They left their tools and programs scattered throughout the vast network. Some have been found by seekers such as yourself and have been passed down from generation to generation. Collectively these independent pieces of software are known as Enchiridion of the Computarchs. \nK.J. O'Brien\nEnchiridion of the Computarchs gives a judge the leg up on developing and using casting mechanics and concepts in high-tech settings. This book encompasses a range of material concerning computers and programs that a \u201ctechno-caster\u201d (like the MCC shaman class, or those classes found in Cyber Sprawl Classics, Crawljammer, Umerica, Terror of the Stratosfiend, and Star Crawl) can utilize. Depending on how you want to play DCC RPG Empire of the East or DCC RPG Dying Earth, this book could be used in those settings as well. You will find a collection of spells (aka, programs) in this book, a d24 spellburn table, new mechanics for spell failure, and a brief corruption table all couched in a high-technobabble style for your post-apocalyptic, far-future, and dystopian-future campaigns.\nBook Specifications\nOfficially licensed DCC & MCC third party product.\nPledge rewards are at a discounted price.\n8.5\" x 11\" supplement, ~100 pages, back & white interior, color cover.\nPlenty of art.

This campaign is going to go very light on stretch goals, because I want to present the complete book rather than dancing around and celebrating stretch goals.\n However, there are some additions to make if we meet certain funding goals:\n $1,500 - If the project funds, I'll open up a crowdsource file for submitting mercurial effects to include in the book. The section will be called Program Provenance and will give a bit of a backstory and mercurial effects to the user's programs. A little taste of the G+ days when we used to set a topic and throw a bunch of ideas in the stew pot. I'll edit and add to the submitted ideas until we have a full list of 80. This idea is subject to participation. If there are none or very few submissions, I may abandon the effort. \n $5,000 - ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronic) Generator. An additional appendix to help flesh out the monsters and guardians of the meta-verse.\n $6,000 - Kickstarter only printing on 70 lb. paper (standard color in OBS). This option will not be available with the future DriveThruRPG POD release.\nMatt Sutton\nProject Status\nThe writing is 100% finished and layout is 90% complete. Artists are being lined-up for commissions and about a third of the art is already done. The focus is on a finished project, rather than a dynamic product based on backer support. This will allow us to get it into your hands fast.\nWhy?\nI've been working on this project on and off since Mutant Crawl Classics RPG came into our lives. I wanted a little something extra for shamans than what was in the book and I figure others might too. Joseph Goodman has been extremely supportive of this project.\nThat said, most of the programs are re-skins of DCC RPG spells. There are 4 new programs in the book and around 10 of the re-skins were substantial face-lifts. Mechanics borrow from DCC RPG in places, but there is a fair amount of new mechanics and some generation tables. This book is not novel, revolutionary, or even particularly necessary for the DIY judge. Download a free preview from DriveThruRPG and judge for yourself whether the full book will find some use at your table.\nI am planning for OBS for printing and fulfillment; that will keep shipping costs down for international backers. Except Canada. Printer for North America is in the USA and you pay first class international. Sorry Canada. I loved the prints from Mixam, but costs are high right now and OBS allows me to offer you the choice between soft and hard cover to control what you can spend.\nSince we're not doing a ton of stretch goals and as a way of saying thanks for the early support, Enchiridion of the Computarchs is being offered at a price below the MSRP. So act now and save!\nDiogo Nogueira\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games. Mechanically, DCC is based on the world\u2019s most popular RPG, but the rules have been reforged\u2014streamlined in some places, expanded in others, and injected with a wild and exciting imagination throughout.  The fantastical imagery and fast playstyle are designed to invoke the classic fantasy and science-fiction adventures tales of old.

MCC returns players to the early days of sci-fi role-playing and pays homage to Gamma World & Metamorphosis Alpha. The system draws on the innovations that make DCC so popular, including Luck and random effects tables, but offers new races, classes, and artificially intelligent machines and patrons in a post-apocalyptic setting!\nFind out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics and Mutant Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\nAbout the Author\nJames A.

Thanks to its unique encounter system featuring exponential growth, it's suitable for player characters of any level. The story allows you to explore a new setting (the land of Valdir), inhabited by variety of original creatures and obstacles for the players to overcome. The book itself (a tome of more than 350 pages long, illustrated in full color) contains the sandboxy campaign, but also a complete bestiary (including printable monster tokens) and an overview of the setting - but rather than reading about the setting, I want you to experience it first-hand! This can only be accomplished by playing through the campaign and uncovering the secrets of Valdir as you go along.\nUp until a century ago, the land of Valdir was inhabited by humans, ruled by four powerful wizards. Then one night, all human life vanished from the face of Valdir without a trace. To this day, no one knows what happened or what made them abandom the world they built, but it was the wizards' servants who were left behind to fend for themselves. Four species of familiar -beasts, undead, constructs and fey- inherited the ruins of Valdir's once-great civilization. New strife erupted to fill the power gap the wizards had left in their absence, and several powerful factions emerged among their former familiars. When a summoning ritual goes awry, an external influence is unleashed upon Valdir for the first time in a hundred years, in the form of the player characters. They will have to navigate ancient ruins and enchanted locations as well as the political battlefield to eventually decide the fate of Valdir in this open-ended story that goes beyond good and evil. YOUR choices will have a lasting impact on the future of Valdir!\nUnfamiliar isn't just a setting, a bestiary or a set of adventure hooks. It's a complete adventure campaign set in an original world with an alien look and feel, unlike anything you've ever encountered before. The book is divided into fourteen chapters, each a complete adventure module in itself based on locations in Valdir. The player characters choose where they'll go while exploring the strange lands surrounding them, and depending on where their trail  leads them, you simply run the appropriate chapter. The chapters are interlinked by four possible metaplots that make up the overarching story and reach their conclusion in one of four different endings; it's up to the players to decide which route their characters take, which bait to take, and which alliances to form in order to get the upper hand and create their very own custom-built story as they go along.\nApart from that, this game utilizes a unique system of exponentional growth where encounters are concerned. Instead of going where the level-appropriate monsters are, encounter difficulty will adapt to match the experience level of your party. As such, this campaign is playable with characters of any level. You have that one character you've been aching to play again appear in Valdir, or start anew with a party of level-one characters. Anything is possible as the story adapts itself to your needs!\n\nWhat happened to the humans of Valdir? How will the different species of familiar react to the changes the players bring?  Will the PCs step forward as noble freedom-fighters or as opportunists who ally themselves with the most powerful faction? Or maybe they just want to get back home? Anything is possible in this huge adventure campaign that'll have you plotting and scheming as well as exploring and uncovering secrets for years on end. But don't take my word for it - here's an excerpt from the book's introduction to give you some more information on what it's all about:  Unfamiliar.pdf \nIn exchange for your generous pledge, you'll get a full-color, beautifully illustrated, hardcover book, more than 350 pages long. The adventure campaign within should have you exploring the land of Valdir for years on end! You'll also get a set of printable monster tokens, as the creatures of this mythic land differ significantly from what you're used to. And did I mention that shipping is absolutely free worldwide?\n\n...And as we're feeling exceptionally charitable today, 5 % of all the funds raised by this Kickstarter campaign will go to Castle Critical, a non-profit organisation here in Belgium that brings role-playing games to children's hospitals. Voluntary dungeon masters set out to play games with hospitalized kids on a regular basis to make their stay more comfortable and, of course, provide an escape from harsh reality at a time when they need it most.

As I wanted to avoid that (free shipping also means no extra costs in my book!), I've now partnered with a local distributor (Hydra Games) for printing and distribution.

But when it comes to the climactic boss battle encounters that cap off single adventures or entire campaigns, it\u2019s often much harder for GMs to work things out on the fly.\nThat\u2019s where this book comes in. \nFantastic Lairs cover art by Jack Kaiser\nScott Gray, James Introcaso, and Mike Shea have teamed up to lighten the load of shaping and developing your game\u2019s climactic encounters. Fantastic Lairs is a book of capstone lair encounters for your 5e fantasy RPG, designed to inspire and fit into your own campaign. Each fantastic lair includes evocative artwork, a beautiful full-color map, and a well-designed and playtested boss encounter for characters of various levels.\nCheck out the free sample, which includes two fantastic lairs you can use right now! We're also releasing virtual tabletop-ready maps for these two lairs so you can run them easily online.\nThe initial campaign goal for this book includes lairs for 1st- through 10th-level characters, each of which includes instructions for scaling it for different levels of play. After breaking through five stretch goals, we will now add lairs for 11th- through 20th-level play. The book will now include twenty lairs for all four tiers of play. \nFantastic Lairs is the joint brainchild of all three members of the design team, each of whom brings a wealth of creative skill and experience to the project. From over fifty initial concepts, the team narrowed down a selection of twenty ultimate boss lairs for development in this book.\nYour support for this project will fund the design, development, editing, artwork, and cartography that will make this book a reality. The more support we receive, the better the book will be. \nInternal view of Caves of the Cockatrice (Illustration by Allie Briggs)\nThe Lairs\nThanks to our backers' outstanding support we will have the following twenty lairs in this book.\nLair of the Cockatrice (1st Level). A shadow-infused cockatrice keeps a stone garden in a lair built around an ancient and corrupted fey gateway.\nCentipede Cultists (Tier 1). A band of centipede-worshipping cultists feed living sacrifices to their pets in a fallen temple of Asmodeus.\nNevermind (Tier 1). The Dead Roses, a band of cutthroats led by the murderous bandit captain Adilia Rose, hide out between jobs in a seedy tavern built from a titan's skull.\nLord Whiskers (Tier 1).

(Illustration by Jack Kaiser)\nArt Book. Every backer will receive the digital version of the Fantastic Lairs Art Book, containing the art and maps for each lair, suitable for showing to your players. Those backing the print-option tier will also have the option to buy a physical art book at the cost of printing and shipping.\nReward Tiers\nWe have two simple reward tiers for this project: the $15 digital tier and the $20 physical tier. The physical tier will give you the ability to buy print-on-demand copies of the book and any print-based stretch goals at the cost of printing and shipping, fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.\nStretch Goals\nWe have already broken through ten stretch goals adding ten lairs, a monster appendix, and an art book for all backers. We have also unlocked a hardcover option for all print-on-demand backers. (Backers of the $20 print-on-demand option tier will be able to order either softcover or hardcover versions of the book at the cost of printing and shipping.) We have more stretch goals coming in the future.\nWe\u2019re also going to put together adventure outlines that we\u2019ll be releasing to all backers as a digital-download PDF supplement to Fantastic Lairs. Each of these adventure outlines will provide DMs with the narrative bare bones of a potential adventure arc \u2014 or even a full campaign \u2014 linking and leading into some of our own favorite fantastic lairs from the book. Each outline is like a summary that you can use as a starting point and narrative guideline to build a full adventure or campaign, highlighting potential plot points, cool backstories, great locations, exciting encounters, memorable NPCs and monsters, and more.\nThese outlines will be written by TK Johnson, LaTia Jacquise, Lysa Penrose, Jen Vaughn, Leon Barillaro, Willy Abeel, Casey Machado, Collette Quach, Rich Lescouflair, and Jess Ross.\nWe're also adding THREE final, special boss lairs based on suggestions given to us by backers. Voting in the backers-only poll is now live and will end at the same time as the Kickstarter!\nThe Physical Tier and Print-on-Demand\nAs we have in other projects, this project will deliver physical rewards as print-on-demand books from DriveThruRPG. You will be responsible for the costs of printing and shipping once the books are done. Both printing and shipping costs vary depending on the size of the book and any increases in costs from the printers, but they are usually very reasonable (roughly $11 for the softcover and $23 for the hardcover + shipping).\nDelivering books through a print-on-demand publisher helps us keep the costs down as much as possible. It's the most efficient way to get this physical book into your hands.\n(Dungeons & Dragons and D&D are registered trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe ten initial lairs are written and have been through initial edits.

The Kickstarter includes a town sourcebook for Cat's Cradle, the adventure Eye of Itral, and Fortune Hunters, a book of town-oriented NPCs. This Kickstarter is a bit different from our normal approach -- see \"PPA Loan and COVID-19\" below.\nA Place of Dangers and Opportunities\nA walled town of roughly 4000 citizens, Cat's Cradle is a modular resource that can be used any time you need a town at the intersection of trade routes. In the world of the Lost Lands it is located in the Duchy of Saxe, at the intersection of the Gap Road and the Hyon River. This puts the town conveniently close to the Necromancer Games adventure Trouble at Durbenford. The primary focus of this 3-book set, though, is to fill in the gap when you need a relatively detailed town on short notice.\nWhat\u2019s in Cat\u2019s Cradle?\nCat's Cradle Sourcebook: A 44-page sourcebook on the shops, industries, factions, and mysteries of Cat\u2019s Cradle. This book is system neutral.\nThe Eye of Itral: A 44-page \u201cfantasy noir\u201d adventure in Cat\u2019s Cradle written by Ken Spencer. Available for 5th Edition, Swords & Wizardry, and Pathfinder 1e.\nFortune Hunters: A plethora of NPCs who live in and drift through the town. Available for 5th Edition, Swords & Wizardry, and Pathfinder 1e. 44 pages.\nAll three of the books are premium-quality paper, saddle-stitched, and printed in the USA.\nPPA Loan and COVID-19\nWe\u2019re using the proceeds of a PPA loan to employ our writers and artists on an immediate basis, which lets us keep paying them at normal levels despite a bad market. For this reason, we\u2019re following the unusual procedure of offering a Kickstarter before the work itself is completed. The books will be printed at the Arizona printshop we use for Indiegogo projects rather than in China, which allows us a much faster turnaround to backers. Most of the initial legwork has already been done, and the project should be almost completed by the time the Kickstarter ends, with the exception of layout and some of the art orders. To the extent the Kickstarter generates any profit \u2014 which isn\u2019t guaranteed in this market \u2014 we will continue turning the profit around to new projects, to generate as steady a stream of work-flow as we can.\nThe Books\n  The Cat's Cradle Sourcebook describes the important locations in the town and its immediate surroundings, such as the \"salt\" mines formed by the ancient intersection of some massive interplanar beast with the material plane. The otherworldly mineral deposits left behind are used in Cat's Cradle's thriving alchemy-related businesses.\n The Eye of Itral is a \"film noir\" type adventure set in Cat's Cradle, written by Ken Spencer. Mysteries and secrets abound, and some of them can be very, very dangerous...\n Fortune Hunters is a book of non-player characters that may be encountered in town. Each of the NPCs is detailed at three different points in their history: low level, medium level, and high level. They can be used as recurring allies or villains with ready explanations of what they have been doing since the last time the characters encountered them.\nStretch Goals\nOur Stretch Goals for this Kickstarter are parts of the Waypoints series written by Mike \"Sieg\" Stewart. \nAdventure is what your players crave. They seek fortune around every corner. Alas, glory is often found in remote locales that require a perilous journey before they can even begin their quest. Expeditions do not happen instantly, and the journey can be an adventure all its own. What will they find? Where will they stay? Where can they get a drink on the way? Waypoints is a series of digital releases focused on individual places that range from key locations such as a temple within a city to a secluded inn at the edge of civilization, its lonely hall only nominally a subject to any faraway king. The Waypoints series will highlight a single business, public building, or other more fantastical point of interest and is designed to be a creative interlude for everything from rest to rescue. All the mechanics within the text are general and designed to apply to any popular tabletop roleplaying game system.\n UNLOCKED! $18,000 Waypoints: General Store (PDF)\n UNLOCKED! $21,000 Waypoints: Bazaar (PDF)\n UNLOCKED! $25,000 Waypoints: Armorer (PDF)\n[LOCKED] $30,000 Waypoints: The Gaol (PDF)\nShipping\nDigital Reward Shipping\nYou will be receiving a kickstarter survey to finalize your address and contact information. We will email the instructions to groups of eligible backers with instructions on how to access PDF pledge rewards. This is a three-step process that is completed using our web store. You will have to create a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything. The Kickstarter PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by backers (as they are paid for after the Kickstarter) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code will be sent via email to backers at the email address provided in the Kickstarter survey. This process gets you your correct reward, ensures your future access to your reward files, and allows us to track project fulfillment. If you are missing something from your account, and see all over Facebook that everyone else has it, please email Mike at mike@froggodgames.com, and he will set things right for you. Be patient for a few days after it is first released though, as we do release these in batches to prevent crashing our server.\nPhysical Reward Shipping\n Your Kickstarter pledge amount does not include shipping.\nYou will be receiving a kickstarter survey to finalize your address and contact information. The first step toward getting your softcover set(s) to you. The second step, once the rewards are ready to ship, will be detailed in an email. This email will contain instructions to complete your reward selection and pay for it to be shipped to you. This step is also where your system selection(s) of 5e, S&W, or PFRPG takes place. This will be done using the Frog God website.\nShipping Damage or other Related Issues\nNo matter what we do, the post office seems to have a desire to drop, kick, throw or even drive over some packages with trucks (yes, it has happened). In the unlikely event that you are one of the lucky folks that have this happen to you, we will of course send you a new book. All you need to do is send photos of the damage in an email to Mike at mike@froggodgames.com. He will set you up with a new book. Please do not send multiple emails to multiple sources as it confuses the process and may cause delay. That being said, we have a 100% delivery promise on our books. You are the reason we are able to make cool products, and your satisfaction matters to us.\nRefunds\nIf for some reason you need a refund post-Kickstarter, we are happy to oblige, less a 13% charge that we pay to Kickstarter and Paypal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike most of our Kickstarters, this one is being produced in real-time rather than before launch in order to provide an income stream to creators from our PPA loan. We estimate that the writing will be completed before the Kickstarter ends, but the project carries the risks associated with projects that launch before substantial completion.\nFrog God Games has been in business since 2010, and has fulfilled numerous (27!) Kickstarter projects. As with any crowdfunding program, the time-lapse between payment and delivery of a final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of a supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, and changes in the prices of materials and shipping. Experience gained over a number of projects makes us confident that we have contingency plans for the ordinary, foreseeable issues that might arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 24 or more", "title": "Town Guard (PDF)", "descp": "Digital copy of the Cat's Cradle Sourcebook, The Eye of Itral (Adventure), and Fortune Hunters (NPCs) in ONE rule-system.

Forbidding skies stained the color of blood. Thunderous, bestial sounds roaring from across the sea. Natural disasters of all varieties are raging uncontrollably across the land. Through it all, rumors swirl of strangely-clad heretics and wild-eyed blasphemers running amok, whispering prophecies of annihilation. What is happening\u2026 and why?\nLearned folk of every race have assembled with the most renowned oracles and seers of our age in an effort to discover what is truly happening. They all point to one place as the source of their collective woe \u2013 the primeval jungles and untouched shores of the legendary Skullcano Island!\nThrough eldritch sorcery and divine visions, these great users of magic have deduced that a terrible power has arrived on Skullcano Island, drawn to the light and life that is our world. These mysterious wardens of doom seek to perpetuate an apocalyptic extinction event that will plunge the world back into a primordial age, using the island's legendary kaiju to wipe the slate clean once and for all. \nNow that the land is filled with these terrible tidings of the apocalypse and all signs point to Skullcano Island, a call has gone out for only the most experienced and powerful of adventurers. An elite fellowship has been assembled and sent forth to discover what the true heart of this menace is and, if able, put a stop to it before the entire world is reduced to ashes. Will the player characters survive and \u2013 if so \u2013 what will remain of the world when they are done?\nThe Skullcano, Illustrated by Ed Bickford\nMuch like our previous adventure modules, Escape from Skullcano Island is an old school, grindhouse-style combination of classic role playing adventure and 5E roleplaying style cram-packed with b-movie, monster movie-era badassery to challenge even the most seasoned of adventurers.  This is our most ambitious and outright crazy adventure module yet. It clocks in at over 100 pages and if the stretch goals are met, it could be as large as 140 pages! A fellow writer got a sneak peek and said \"If the Isle of Dread dropped LSD with the island from Lost while watching old giant monster movies and listening to Black Sabbath, this is the adventure that you'd get\". I honestly couldn't think of a better endorsement.\nEscape from Skullcano Island is a high level adventure designed for a group of Tier 4 player characters, but is easily scalable for Tier 3 level challenges. If slappin' down apocalyptic death cults or taking on titanic kaiju in a land that time forgot is in your wheelhouse, then you're in the right place. We're excited to take you back to a time when the simplest things in life were worrying about making your saving throw against some giant monster's lightning breath or duking it out toe to toe with a bunch of entropy-worshiping doomslakers in the heart of a raging volcano. Oh, and there's plenty of face-offs against slobbering monsters of all shapes and sizes to whet your appetite for the old school. Feel like taking on a two-headed gorilla-god in the ruins of ancient flooded forest? We've got that too, in all the pulpy, retro, Grindhouse-style you can handle. In the end, we wanted to write the kind of stuff that we would want to play ourselves. After all, who wants to spend a night of gaming not having fun?\nIf its not obvious by now, this adventure is full of kaiju - titanic monsters that dwarf even the most savage of wild beasts. Make no mistake though - this is definitely a heroic fantasy adventure module that involves equal measures of combat and good ole\u2019 fashioned hex-crawling, as the players at first find themselves dealing with the mysteries of a strange island lost to man and then later exploring the inner recesses of the titular Skullcano itself. All along the way, legendary titans stalk the land followed by their often-inhuman and bloodthirsty cargo-cult worshipers! \nKaiju, Illustrated by John Gulow\nThe design team at Planet X Games is an established company with a solid Kickstarter history full of  published, talented artists and hardcore role playing gaming vets excited to  bring you a unique role playing experience unlike any other. With fully  realized, professional-level art and maps, deadly new monsters, fresh new magical items and fully expanded locations in and around the savage territories of Skullcano Island, get ready to set your players on course for a head on collision with a lost island and the apocalyptic mega-titans that roam its shores!\nSo what\u2019s so special about this module and what makes it different?  What exactly is the Grindhouse-Style?\nAny devoted movie fan can tell you that a \u201cgrindhouse\" was an  American term for a movie theater that mainly showed exploitation and  genre films, with cut-rate ticket prices and often questionable  atmosphere.\nWe\u2019re bringing that atmosphere, old school style and all the b-movie, monster movie fun that comes with it to the gaming table. Our adventurers put the grind in Grindhouse, with dangers aplenty to keep your players wondering if they really want to head back into that dungeon. We\u2019re combining that with top shelf art, incredible cartography and explosive encounters to give you and your players something to chew on and talk about over the gaming table for years to come.\nCartography by Karl Stjernburg, @skullfungus\nEscape from Skullcano Island features illustrations and full-scale cartography by  many talented artists, including Adrian Landeros, Karl Stjernberg, Edwin Bickford III, John Gulow, Je Shields, Diogo Noguiera, Keelan Halvorsen and Lawrence Hernandez.\nHere\u2019s a small peek at the sort of crunchy goodness you can find between its covers:\n\u00b7 Full details on the titanic kaiju who roam Skullcano Island... as well as the apocalyptic death cult that seeks to unleash them on an unsuspecting world! Witness Umagung, the Worm that Waits! Tremble upon the sight of Grulok, the Two-Headed Terror! Flee in terror from Threejaws, the Burrower Beneath! Fear the coming of Melmoth, the Ghost Spider! Think that's all? Well think again! We've got more rampaging titans of myth than you can shake a tarrasque at! It\u2019s our guarantee - if this module doesn\u2019t have your players wondering if their characters are gonna make it out of this adventure in one piece, then we didn't do our jobs!\n\u00b7 Full details on Skullcano Island itself, as well as the numerous savage tribes and cargo cult inhabitants that make this strange island their home. Fully realized and detailed, complete with fleshed out encounters, fully-detailed adversaries, locations and village trappings! Who are the Wives of the Worm and what terrible secret do they hide beneath the waters of the mire? Can you survive a run in with the Pale Ones or will you be cocooned so that your poisoned flesh can be offered up to the Melmoth, the great god-spider? What mysteries lie dormant within the ruins of the Mecha-Kaiju?\n\u00b7 DOZENS of new encounter areas presented in the classic \"sandbox\" style to challenge players of even the highest levels.  What secrets can be divined from the Cave Paintings of Nacch-Toth? What prophetic dreams may come to pass should you sleep beneath the Black Oracle of Thuln? Dare you cross paths with the devil mud-men of the Black Lake? All these and many more await for your players to discover them.\nDenizens of Skullcano Island, by Adrian Landeros\n\u00b7 Deadly encounter areas, fully fleshed out and ready to play. Dare  you explore the ruins of the Crumbling Tower of Ng to uncover sinister secrets that could help you along your way? Dare you go head to head with the Doomsayers of Kraak-Thul or will you be reduced to atoms by their crackling spell-blasts of entropy? Will you tempt the fates and explore the landlocked ruins of Telshara's Wink? Will you run afoul of Grulok the Two-Headed Terror or find yourself mired in the slime-pits of the great worm Umagog? What other savage terrors will unleash their limitless hunger on an unsuspecting world?\n\u00b7 More than a DOZEN brand new magical items and artifacts never seen anywhere  before. Behold the Doom Gyre, stolen from Hell itself, where it helped fuel the very fires of perdition! Incite plagues of madness or tidings of woe with the doomsayer's fiddle! Grow to enormous size after chuggin' down a decanter full of titanblood brew! Discover the mysteries of the mul-duk spirit pouch, the sash of withered tongues, the eye of ulgazi and many more! All these and more are fleshed out in full detail and are completely compatible with 5E.\n\u00b7 Spells, spells and more spells! Take on the strengths and characteristics of the kaiju who stalk Skullcano Island with Aspect of the Titan! Unleash the destructive nature of reality upon your enemies with Creeping Entropy! Break your enemies apart at the molecular level with Discordant Decay! Break down the source code of the universe with Hungering Void! These spells and many more are included to add a little something new to the Game Master's toolbox and help make Escape from Skullcano Island feel unique for your players.\n\u00b7 We're bringing back the Trope Mechanic! Part of what makes all Planet X  modules feel unique is the atmosphere and setting, and tropes go a long  way towards giving Escape from Skullcano Island that monster movie \u201cGrindhouse\u201d flavor.\nThe Sentinel of Vitto-Bors, Illustrated by Adrian Landeros\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$1000 \u2013 The ground shall shake and the skies turn red - we're FUNDED!

Our graphic designer already has a head start and is putting things together in advance. \n\nWe are waiting on the project to be funded before we compile the final PDFs , so they have not been hosted as of this writing. When ready, they'll go up early via a DropBox link and you will receive an e-mail with the links. They will also be downloaded to DriveThru RPG so that they will always be in your library.

We highly recommend you also read the Saberhagen Empire of the East series, available as a modern compilation or in the original three individual volumes, titled The Broken Lands, The Black Mountains, and Ardneh\u2019s World (or Changeling Earth). \nTake up your sword, gather your spells, and stand with Ardneh\u2019s armies against John Ominor and his forces of darkness!\nPhysical format. This book is offered in PDF form, as well as hardcover print format. Final page count is estimated at 80-90 pages.\nDo I need to own the DCC rules? Yes. This is a sourcebook for DCC RPG. You can buy the DCC RPG core rulebook at the Goodman Games online store.\nDo I need to read Fred Saberhgagen's Empire of the East novels? You don't have to, but we strongly recommend it. They are great books and will expand your gaming experience considerably!\nInside the DCC Sourcebook\nDCC: The Empire of the East has been in development for years. Adapted by lead designer Jason Vey, the sourcebook takes you to the Empire of the East and gives you just enough information to create your own adventures there - while also leaving you room to design your own campaigns.\nAs with all DCC products from Goodman Games, the book is lavishly illustrated.\nChapter one covers adapting the existing character classes. \nChapter two covers magic, including new rules for spell enervation which can be substituted for corruption to capture the aesthetic of Empire of the East. Eighteen new spells are presented, including several related to the summoning or control of demons, djinnis and elementals as discussed in Fred Saberhagen's novels. There are two new patron AIs presented, capturing the role of Ardneh and Orcus from the original novels.\nSome readers may be asking, why is Empire of the East presented as compatible with DCC instead of Mutant Crawl Classics? This hardcover can be used easily in either system, but due to the high presence of magic we're presenting it as a DCC \"base.\" \nChapter three presents monsters. There are seven creatures, as well as new rules for demons, djinns and elementals.\nChapter four presents personalities of the Changeling Earth. These 16 NPCs from the stories can be used as allies or enemies in your campaign.\nChapter five is science, technology and magic. Those of you who have read the novels know that \"the Elephant\" plays a mighty part in the plot. We do not burden you with detailed stats for the super-science of the Changeling Earth but instead give general guidelines for inserting these items into your game.\nChapter seven presents two new adventures set in the Changeling Earth: Invaders, a level 0-1 adventure by Jason Vey, and The Demon Key, a level 0-1 adventure by Harley Stroh. \nThe Empire of the East Novels\nIn the distant future, society has crumbled. Dark forces now rule the land, keeping all humans under their oppressive thumbs.\nIn the darkness of the shadows and whispered on the winds, there is talk of a rebellion. In the swamps, a small band has formed. Determined to regain their freedom, the rebellion, heavily outnumbered, plans to overthrow an army of thousands . . . with the help of one incredible weapon.\nIt is only a legend, a story left over from the Old World before magic and the wizards came to the land. A weapon of technology. It is the mystical Elephant, and whoever masters it holds the key to freedom, or defeat.\nOne young man, determined to avenge the death of his family, sets out to join the rebellion and find Elephant. What he discovers will change everything.\nThe Empire of the East novels are still in print decades after their original publication. You can find vintage editions online. The author's estate has recently released updated e-book editions, which are available in Kindle format on Amazon. You can find them here:\nEmpire of the East Book I: The Broken Lands\nEmpire of the East Book II: The Black Mountains\nEmpire of the East Book III: Ardneh's World \nWhat is DCC RPG?\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game is a modern RPG that reflects D&D\u2019s origin-point concepts with decades-later rules editions. From the company that was publishing old-school modules before the OSR ever existed, DCC RPG is not an old-school clone, but a re-imagining of what D&D could have been, utilizing the game\u2019s primary sources of inspiration. To quote from the back cover:\nYou\u2019re no hero.\nYou're an adventurer: a reaver, a cutpurse, a heathen-slayer, a tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets. You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. Adventure as 1974 intended you to, with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery. Fast play, cryptic secrets, and a mysterious past await you: turn the page\u2026\nYou can learn more from this prior Kickstarter for the game's 4th printing. You can buy the 7th printing here.\n What is MCC RPG?\nTriumph & Technology Won by Mutants & Magic!\nYou\u2019re no zero.\nYou\u2019re a wasteland wanderer: a mutant, a seeker, a robot-killer, a stoic shaman guarding forgotten ancient sciences. You seek triumph and technology, winning it with mutations and magic, soaked in the radiation and quantum fields of the mutated, the savage, the semi-sentient, and the artificially intelligent. There are treasures to be won in the taboo lands and ruins, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of science fiction gaming with the Mutant Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. Adventure like it\u2019s 1978 again, with modern rules grounded in the origins of post-apocalyptic role-playing. Fast play, a mysterious future, and 100% compatibility with the DCC RPG system await you \u2014 just activate your artifact\u2026\nMutant Crawl Classics is a stand-alone post-apocalyptic RPG compatible with DCC RPG. It is a good complement to the Empire of the East sourcebook. You can buy the MCC RPG core rulebook here.\nWhat? No Stretch Goals?\nNo stretch goals.

That era of exciting and high-risk adventuring is back with Goodman Games Dungeon Crawl Classics. These booklets: the city aide: 101 City Encounters & the adventure: A Strange Night at the Pint n' Pony nest right in the center of this creative renaissance. \nOverview\nA Strange Night at the Pint n' Pony is a 16-page richly illustrated stand-alone adventure built for Dungeon Crawl Classics-but easily adapted into any fantasy RPG system. It is available as a softcover PRINT booklet and in a digital PDF format. This \"short\" adventure is fashioned for 16 starting (0-level funnel) characters among the smaller races; halfling, dwarven, gnome, wildling (wild elf) or human children. Great for a one-off evening of fun, or as the starting adventure for a group either new to DCC RPG or who want a fresh and challenging start as a group of shorties.\nCome play it at CYCLOPS CON: (Using Discord for voice and some free APP support for dice and tabletop visuals)\nhttps://tabletop.events/conventions/cyclops-con/schedule#?query=pint\nMock up image of the adventure: A Strange Night at the Pint N' Pony\nThe adventure begins in smoky beer soaked tavern of hobbits, gnomes, and dwarves.\nThe little folk meet each night at a special place away from the troubles of big people. Here, after a long day of work, they share simple tales and sip ale. Tonight is nothing new\u2014or is it? Sinister forces emerge during happy hour (hic) at this halfling pub. Now, in defense of their precious last keg, new adventurers are born! A tale (hic) only DCC RPG can weave. \nSomething sinister has corrupted the underworld and sewers below the city.\nDouble page map of the sinister world under the Pint n' Pony\n101 City Encounters is a 16-page fully illustrated aide for judges creating city adventures (ideal for DCC Lankhmar). Also available as a softcover PRINT booklet and in a digital PDF format. This aide will bring any city to life. It supplies a detailed set of random events which will make your cities vibrant and exciting. It also features the Reputation & Infamy system for earning various forms of city faction. Players will now have their actions tracked, so they can feel the consequences and rewards of their actions in the social web of your city.\nMock up image of the booklet aide: 101 City Encounters\nThe Adventure\nBeneath the city many call home lies the ruins of the undercity. The undercity is now mainly sewers and the domain of rats and their ratmen masters. Their existence is no mystery to the inhabitants above. They rule their underworld by night, and cohabitate in relative peace with those who walk the earth by day. But what neither knows is the nature of the ancient crypts both these cities were built upon.

The PRINT version is available here or here and the PDF version is here.\n Previous Reviews and Previews \n\"I like how this adventure uses a setting that is probably underserved in this genre (Appendix N version of the fey lands) and is of a high production value.

Go make a pledge and get some yourself some official old school gaming goodness...\"  --From Goodman Games\n\"Greenwood of the Fey Sovereign looks like a fun little funnel at the right price - 7 bucks for the PDF, 10 bucks for the Print copy and 15 for Print plus PDF.

If you want to jump into the old school RPG feel, if you played AD&D and want to get your kids into the games that had the snap you remember, this is the system.\nIt is easy to pick up for people new to RPG games, and a blast for those of us who played the original AD&D classics and games like Gamma World. It has the feel of the Gary Gygax vision for the genre, yet it is a system that improves a lot of the holes in the original systems without getting too complex. Read more here. Best of all you really only need 1 book (to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them). They even have a $5 quickstart rulebook, but i highly recommend the full book since it has all the lovely details, art, and charts you will want.\nThis product is based on the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, published by Goodman Games.

Herein you will encounter nobles, priests, guilders, aliens, psychics, cyborgs, and more.\nThe Character Book (272 pages) presents the game system and player characters for Fading Suns. This book includes character creation rules for all the major factions, as well as technological equipment, starships, psychic powers, and theurgic rites.\nThe Gamemaster Book (96 pages) presents people, places, and plots for Fading Suns. Herein are guidelines for creating dramas for the player troupe and how to populate them with all manner of non-player-character allies, rivals, and foils. An example drama is included, as well as a roll-by-roll description of play.\nIn addition, we have a variety of books and accessories to help you fill in whatever you need at your table:\nThe Faction Book (96 page hardcover) presents the minor houses (from Eldrid to Xanthippe), minor sects (from Chorali to Preceptors), and minor guilds (Apothecaries to Wranglers) of the Fading Suns universe. Herein also are the pagans (Zuranists and Gjartins), the sentient alien species of the Known Worlds (from ascorbites to shantor), and the Changed, the genetically altered mutants scorned by the superstitious populace for their wondrous endowments.\n Intrigues & Escapades (112 page hardcover) unveils the conspiracy customs among nobles, priests, and merchants, showing how some are raised from birth to scheme while others learn from hard knocks. Presented are two detailed dramas involving troupes in such dirty dealings, along with a host of drama hooks that gamemasters can develop with their own twists.\n The GM Screen & Token Set includes the most useful rules and charts: sequence of play, VP costs, Resistance ratings, environmental conditions, weapon traits, and more. Also included are punch sheets with a plethora of victory-point and wyrd-point tokens, making it easy to gain and spend these action resources during play.\nThe Imperial Dossiers for the House Hawkwood, Reeves Guild, and Urth Orthodox factions (64 page softcover) examine in-depth the main factions of the Fading Suns universe. Each book serves as a primer on a single faction, commissioned by the empire for its diplomats, bureaucrats, soldiers, star-sailors, Questing Knights, and their Cohorts, with commentary from the Imperial Eye. Each book also includes a \u201cfactbook\u201d about a topic closely related to the dossier\u2019s faction, and a rules section that includes new callings, perks, equipment, and even alien creatures.\nIf you're returning to Fading Suns as a veteran player, make sure you head to our website to catch up on all of Bill's designer diaries!\nIf you're brand new to Fading Suns, check out our Introduction document or the Ulisses International YouTube Channel for our current actual play series.

Built for OSR Systems. Bonus compatibility for Dungeon World, 5E, and SS&SS!\nSpellsword is now on YouTube! Subscribe now to get sneak previews of the creation and progress of The Evils of Illmire.\nMy favorite types of adventure modules have always been the ones that provide not just a central plot, but also robust peripheral content to surround it. Adventurers will probably get involved in the main quest, but there are a lot of other things to keep them busy in the nearby areas too. Interesting creatures, locales, dungeons, and treasures abound in these types of modules. PCs are free to explore and meddle in a sandbox environment with many interactive parts. This is an attempt to capture that and mash it down into a digestible zine format that is actually useful and inspires the Game Master.\nProject Roots: The core concept and bulk of the ideas come from a classic 2nd Edition campaign I ran in the summer of 1997. I've since then revisited the content and added a number of other points of interest to create an adventure region stocked with dungeons, monsters, and treasures, all with an underlying sandbox plot that doesn't railroad. Traps are vicious and brutal. Adventurers will find classic +1 swords alongside a myriad of weird and interesting artifacts hidden in dangerous spots around the map. They'll clash with and flee from familiar monsters and a bunch of new creepy things.\nArt \u00a9 Stinky Goblin Emporium 2020\nAdventure Synopsis: A cult has begun to infiltrate to town of Illmire, spreading paranoia and terrorizing the locals with fear-mongering in order to feed their demonic idol. The cult worships an extra dimensional demon they found in some ruins in the nearby swamp. Lured by mysterious rumors of treasure out in the wilds, adventurers face an uphill battle against organized and fanatical zealots lead by vile, sorcerous clerics. They'll stop at nothing to further their diabolical schemes, and the people of Illmire will be crushed beneath their boot as they launch a campaign of torment and terror that will spread far beyond Illmire unless put to a stop.\nArt \u00a9 Stinky Goblin Emporium 2020\nProduct Features: This will be a 64-page zine, A5 format (5.5x8.5). It will contain a small hexcrawl with 19 distinct hexes, each with details and a wandering monster table. There is a map of the town of Illmire, as well as 15 detailed, one-page locations/dungeons. In addition, there is a bestiary for the adventure featuring some new monsters for adventurers to fight or run from. There is a simple weather system (so easy you'll actually want to use it!) to determine which hexes are experiencing rain, thunderstorms, floods, mudslides, blizzards, etc. There's awesome black & white artwork to help inspire terror. It's laid out in professional, clear, concise format meant to be quick and easy to use on game night.\nArtwork: The pages are graced with evocative artwork from Jack Badashski and Heather Shinn (Stinky Goblin Emporium). There is wicked cover art and a custom hex map that will be provided by Patrik Olsson. The dungeon cartography is by legendary mapper Dyson Logos. We've also brought on the illustrator known as HodagRPG as a spot artist for the character sheet, player handouts, and other neat little visual things that come with all pledge levels.\nCover art not finalized and may change\nShipping\nShipping is not included. You'll pay for shipping separately later. When the zine is ready to start shipping (estimated mid-April), we'll provide a coupon code for 100% off when you place your order, so you'll only pay for the shipping at that time. \nEstimated shipping costs:\nUS: $4.00\nCanada: $12.00\nEverywhere Else: $16.00+\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWe've hit our funding goal and went right on past it! Let's make this thing even more awesome! \n We hit $1000 in funding! We will have the hex map re-drawn by a talented artist to give it even more life and personality.\n We hit $1200 in funding! The booklet will gain a high quality, heavy stock cover with some truly wicked artwork that will make it look great in your zine stack.\n We hit $1400 in funding! The product will include a printable, hand-drawn OSR character sheet PDF to use with your Evils of Illmire campaign.\n We hit $1600 in funding! Evils of Illmire now includes a digital PDF guidebook you can print out to hand to your players as an introduction to Illmire. This'll be great for on-boarding adventurers and getting them in the right mindset (excited and terrified at the same time). \n We hit $1800! I'll add an optional second set of 4-panels to go inside of the Adventure's Guide, making it a total of 8 panels.\n We hit $2000! I'll add Module Reference GM Screen panels! The digital package will contain PDF files to print for use as inserts in the DriveThruRPG customizable GM screen. If you don't have one of these screens, no worries; just paper-clip the printed panels to an existing GM screen. \n We hit $2200! I'll add a second side to the custom character sheet to include extra space for notes and tracking conditions for your poor, poor adventurers.\n We hit $2500! I'll now add 4 additional pages to the 64-page zine; this means it'll be a 68-page zine. Three of these pages will be added to the Gazeteer of Illmire and will cover unique flora and fauna of the region; a few may be dangerous enough to warrant combat stats, but most will be either interesting to encounter or useful in some way. The final page will be a guide to crafting items using ingredients harvested from said flora and fauna.\n We hit $3000! Amazing! We'll now include pre-made characters so you can hop right into a game or hand them out as quick replacements for fallen adventurers. Prefer to make your own characters? Me too; use these guys as possible hirelings or a rival adventuring party!\n We $3500! The module will gain a separate expansion PDF that adds an Underdark area, including another dungeon! \n We hit $4000! I'll keep adding more art to make this zine gorgeous!\nNEW STRETCH GOAL!

This roughly 32 page A5 zine has everything you need to generate natural formations, forgotten ruins, enemies, wyrd magics, and ancient monstrosities. It has a simple turn-based combat system, rules for building your hold, and tips on how to implement your hold into your RPG world.\nInspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and Dungeon Keeper, DELVE aims to capture that feeling of building and protecting a fortress in an unforgiving subterranean world.\nAll you need to play is, a pencil, paper (preferably 1\" grid), and a deck of playing cards. \nThe Under-King has put out a bounty to all the holds demanding a Void Crystal, a rare and powerful gem found only in the deepest caverns. \nEach round your dwarves will mine another square of the grid, you draw a card from your deck of playing cards and see what they found. Hearts \u2665 and Diamonds \u2666 are resources and trade goods that you'll use for building and hiring units while Clubs \u2663 and Spades \u2660 are natural formations and forgotten ruins. From ancient libraries to goblin lairs, these subterranean locales will become part of your hold's unique layout and may provide unexpected benefits. Or you might just unleash a horde of ravenous insects in which case, you'll need to fight.\nCombat in DELVE is designed to allow for forward planning and strategic thinking without weighing you down with book-keeping. Essentially, all enemies follow the same goal of trying to reach the surface by killing their way through your hold. They can move one grid space per turn, as can all of your units. Once they get into combat, check the rock-paper-scissors style chart to see which group has the advantage and reduce each side by the STR of the other. \nOnce combat is over, it's time to build! As long as a room has access to the hold via a mineshaft or another room, it's good to go. Just pay the cost, and draw it in an available grid (empty or repurpose an old \u2663 or \u2660 grid space). At this stage, you'll also have the opportunity to build traps, reinforce, and hire units to defend your hold.\nJust, be careful as you get deeper though as the black joker is waiting. Drawing this card releases an ancient monstrosity, a randomly generated beast that needs a well stocked army and hold to defeat. \nThe Story of Blood Fate Hold\nThe hold was off to a rough start as their chosen site led straight into the lair of the mud goblin clan, Rushk. The initial group of soldiers sent with the expedition where wiped out in this surprise attack.\nDeciding that bad luck doesn't just strike once, they built a spike wall to defend their stairwell. A good choice as the next pick strike revealed a hive of cave wasps. Some miners perished but the overzealous wasps dashed themselves upon the spike wall.\nFinally, Blood Fate was started, a barracks built just beyond the hive. It's honey would sustain the expedition and our new soldiers would have somewhere to stay while the miners delved deeper.\nA string of good luck found trade goods and resources by the plenty and so they built a stewpot kitchen to hearten the fighting spirits of the soldiers, a shrine to bless their good luck, and finally, a stairwell to descend deeper.\nThe old adage of \"fool me once\" had become mantra for Blood Fate as they focused their efforts on defence. Rock fall traps on the stairwell, and a dead dwarf alarm that would warn of any approaching threat.\nTheir militaristic efforts where rewarded as after ignoring a buried temple (who knows what god it was built to), they broke through to a structure. A cavernous mansion filled with chandeliers, suits of armour, and a blood stained altar. A vampire queen's coterie. Her thralls poured from the shadows, overwhelming the miners and marching through the hold at their dark mistresses behest.\nThe boulder trap dashed the first zealous few on the stairs, weakening their numbers. The stew heartened soldiers fought bravely, managing to strike down all but one. The vampire queen herself. One soldier swore an oath to the gods and launched himself in a frenzy of spinning axes, injuring her before having his head torn from his shoulders. His sacrifice was not in vain however as his bravery bought the reinforcements called by the dead dwarf alarm time to arrive. \nBlood Fate Hold reeks of death and garlic, they say a fool is someone who doesn't learn from past mistakes and these dwarves are no fools. Every room is decorated in holy symbols to gods old and new and once a year the dwarves let blood in a rememberance ritual called Vampik.\nUNCOVERED - For passing \u00a31200 I'll pay an artist to make a better quality cover for DELVE.

While we focus on DCC, the material produced can be easily translated into any Old School Renaissance (OSR) system.\nAfter playing in a session of DCC at Gary Con X in 2018, Brian and Trevor tossed around a few ideas to fix what they saw as some gaps in the rules; this was the germ of the idea that, almost two years later, led to the creation of Tales from the Smoking Wyrm. Contained herein are the stories and bits of knowledge that adventurers have shared around the hearth of the titular inn, and we hope that there will be many such tales for years to come! John and Joel decided they could lend their pens to the project, and so we had a writing team and one artist on time fully. After that Caitlin decided she could help out with the layout and design elements, so we had a cool looking product.\nThis latest kickstarter project picks up where we left off with issue #1 of our zine (currently shipping), with a whole new set of cool articles. Issue #2 goes deeper, explores further, and adds a lot for both players and judges!\n What's Inside?\nThe second issue will contain seven features, usable by both players and judges! Each article will be featured in greater detail in future Kickstarter updates so you have a good sense of what you will be getting, but here is a short list:\n King of Beasts as Patron\u2014Bonding with the wild side gives you distinct advantages!\n Dwarven J\u00e4ger\u2014A subclass of dwarf with a very useful skillset.\n Ritual Magic, Part II\u2014A close-up look at several rituals aimed at those of religious bent. Want to know why unholy creatures burst into flames when they cross the threshold into holy ground\u2014this will tell you, along with other mysteries.\n Culpepper\u2019s Herbal\u2014More herbs for your game. We continue building out an herbal catalog that all adventurers can take advantage of, even in the darkest of times.\n The Shoggoth\u2014A classic monster from deep in our adventuring subconscious finally flexes its full muscles! Also includes a Find Familiar spell for Cthulhu cultists to gain Shoggoth familiars!\n Wyrm Words\u2014A crossword puzzle of all the Gygaxian words in the second issue\u2014this way, a definition is never in doubt!\n Onward Retainer\u2014Starring the Legion\u2014The second installment of an adventuring comic in the old school style\n\nWhat You Will Get\nA tabletop RPG fanzine usable by players and judges\nDigest size (approximately 5 \u00bc by 8 \u00bc )\n40\u201344 pages (layout dependent; subject to increase with stretch goals)\nTwo-color interior\nArticles by: Brian Gilkison, Trevor Stamper, John Olszewski, and Jake Harmon\nArt by: Joel Phillips, Carmin Vance, Brian Maikisch, Alex Mayo, Bradley McDevitt, Caitlin Stamper, and Trevor Stamper\nPDF and Print on Demand (POD) versions of the second issue available (as per backing level\u2014not every level gets these items; POD must still be purchased at cost by those who support at that level)\nLimited Print Edition for Backers\u2014cover stock almost identical to the early 70s era supplements for Original Dungeons & Dragons (Eldritch Wizardry; Gods, Demi-Gods & Heroes; Swords & Spells), heavy paper interior meant to last for a long time; hand numbered for print backers (as per backing level\u2014not every level gets this item)\nSupport Levels\nShipping Costs\nWe will be using media mail for shipping. Each order will ship in a sturdy cardboard envelope via media mail. Per Kickstarter recommendations, shipping and handling costs ARE NOT INCLUDED IN PLEDGE LEVELS. At the time of launch, shipping and handling is planned to be an economical $5 per book shipped. Backers pledging over the tip jar level have the option to add that $5 per book to an existing pledge level.\nAll shipping for this Kickstarter is to the USA ONLY. We looked long and hard at shipping internationally, but the current prices for shipping outside the USA are just outrageous. It isn't that we don't want to ship to everyone, but the prices make it hard to justify (and would, in fact, be more than price of the product itself). Further, we cannot guarantee the booklet will arrive in good order once it leaves USPS hands. For these reasons, we simply cannot offer the limited edition product outside the United States.\nSTRETCH GOAL OVERVIEW\n$2,500 - UNLOCKED!

The file to print your own will be available for free to all backers above the $1 pledge level. \nMudpuppy Games Telepathic Rats could be yours!\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter funds the limited-edition printing for the high-quality Riso print run, and reimburses the artists and design team who have helped bring this issue to life.\nWhere does the project come from?\nFor forty years we have been playing games, and building campaign worlds across all editions of D&D, as well as many other games. During that time, we have created a lot of content that our own players have loved. We have recently come into the DCC community, and the torrent of third-party products is truly amazing! It has inspired us to try our hand at putting together a fanzine of our own, and this is the second issue!\nWhat is the plan?\n1) The Kickstarter ends and we wait for transfer of funds! After that, we will post the pdf of issue 2 for backer review.\n2) We Stomp the Typos! We have supported hundreds of Kickstarters (literally!), and we notice that the very best ones allow for some crowdsourcing of stomping out typos. So, we will allow for two weeks to stomp out the typos! You can report typos on our own website, and we will work these into the editing process for fixing! In the end, we all get a better product.  After all, who wants a wonderful Riso printed limited edition book when it has typos in it?\n3) Final corrections!  We will update the PDF on DriveThruRPG.com, and prep the POD version, which will also need a test print ordered. This is the part where we get the file for the Riso print ready as well!\n4) Review the test prints!  Once we are happy with the physical and POD test prints, we will release them for printing! For some of you, this will be the fulfillment of the Kickstarter, but for many of you, there is one more step!\n5) SHIPPING! We will securely package issue 2\u2014along with any stretch goals\u2014and ship them out to all of you.\n6) Issue 3 is just around the corner! We are deep into writing the next four issues already, with lots of awesome content to drive some seriously crazy roleplaying sessions! For those who back at the \u201cThat third course looks great!\u201d level, as soon as the Kickstarter ends we will give you access to the behind the scenes facebook page where we are deep at work on articles and art for issue 3 and beyond. Come share in the crazy process, and let us hear your voice!\n What is Dungeon Crawl Classics? \nDungeon Crawl Classics is a tabletop role-playing game published by Goodman Games. DCC uses modern mechanics to allow players to experience adventures in line with the heroes described throughout the sword-and-sorcery genre that inspired Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson to create the first role-playing game. Find out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\n About the Wyrm's Creators \n Trevor Stamper\u2014Trevor has had aspirations of being a Not-Quite-As-Dark Master for numerous years, tormenting players in home campaigns on at least two continents. At the age of 10, Trevor was launched into an AD&D game with his friends on Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico. But once he moved to England, he lost touch with the game and explored other classics\u2014Indiana Jones, Twilight 2000, Gangbusters, Traveller 2300\u2014 until Joel Phillips reintroduced him to D&D BECMI style when he was 15. From the start, tinkering with the rules was just common sense to him\u2014in fact, one of the items featured in Issue #1\u2014The Silver Ball\u2014originated in games from this time period run for a game at the infamous Golden Dragons Gaming Club on Woodbridge AFB, and has been stewing there for almost 30 years! From there it has been a life-long passion for gaming and creating things other players can enjoy. Trevor has published before in minor ways\u2014a few articles in the now defunct ENWorld Journal, and some really minor contributions when Kobold Press was doing Open Design. He has also extensively playtested material for almost thirty years\u2014starting with Werewolf first edition for White Wolf, to most recently a plethora of Fantasy Flight Games' offerings in the Warhammer 40K and Star Wars ranges. After 183 Kickstarters as a backer, this is his second one as a creator!\n John Olszewski\u2014John is a scientist, Marine, amateur woodworker, and of course, gamer. Born in a small town on the shores of Lake Erie in Western New York, he is also a lifelong Buffalo Bills and Sabres fan, traveled the world (four continents and counting) and played or ran games everywhere he\u2019s gone. Starting out in junior high school, back in the 1980s with 1st edition D&D, he has been playing ever since. Of the many systems, his favorites include D&D/Pathfinder, World of Darkness, Shadowrun, Warhammer 40K, and now DCC. John met Trevor back in 1997 in New Mexico when they were both in grad school and have been working together since then on world development and game rules for various campaigns, including Nearn\u2014a fantasy ringworld that the Wyrm will touch upon from time to time. In that time, he's playtested extensively for Fantasy Flight Games on their Warhammer 40K and Star Wars games, as well as Ulisses Spiele\u2019s 40K game, and products from Paradigm Concepts and Eden Studios, and been a member of the RPGA and the University of Buffalo\u2019s Strategists and Role Players Association (UB SARPA).\n Brian Gilkison\u2014Nowhere near as evil as Trevor or John (more of a clueless minion, really), Brian first came to gaming through the Holmes box set for D&D; in that same summer, Star Wars was released, and he first read The Hobbit\u2014so he feels like he comes by his geekdom honestly. He was an administrator, writer, and DM for the Ohio region of the RPGA\u2019s Living Greyhawk campaign, and a writer and DM for the followup 4th edition campaign, Living Forgotten Realms. Like Trevor and John, he was also a playtester on the 40K and Star Wars lines from Fantasy Flight Games. It is possible that he may secretly be in charge of his local chapter of the Esoteric Order of Dagon.\n Joel Phillips\u2014Just can\u2019t keep a dude down! Joel was introduced to the world of gaming in 1985 (5th grade) by playing the BECMI edition of D&D, and through the Endless Quest and Fighting Fantasy books. The Fighting Fantasy books inspired Joel to do art. His efforts redoubled when Joel moved to Woodbridge AFB in 1988 and he met Trevor\u2014and the two have been gaming together ever since! Joel went on to the Joe Kubert School for Cartoon Graphic Design to learn more about the trade, but had since fallen away from doing art until reinvigorated by Trevor and Brian's incessant pestering. A lover of all things Warhammer, Joel believes that the Games Workshop brand of games has consumed his life for almost 30 years. Beyond that, Joel has run very successful D&D, Warhammer Fantasy, and Dark Heresy games over the years. Producing the \"Onward Retainer\" comic for the Smoking Wyrm has been a fun revisit to the world of art\u2014and he is now hard at work drafting up the next few episodes. Joel is also an avid blogger, running the Neverness Hobby Chronicles, where he reviews gaming fiction, and paints lots of Orky goodness!\n Caitlin Stamper\u2014Caitlin grew up in a gaming household. Whether it was playing a precocious intelligent mouse at the age of 5 (squeak!), or a groovy witch at the age of 20, she has never known a life where there is something other than a bi-weekly game table (or better yet\u2014weekly\u2014those were the days!) to beckon you to adventure. A Purdue graduate in professional writing and graphic design, Caitlin has the built-in skill set to enable our ideas to bloom on the printed page! She is now seeking the adventure of adult life\u2014editing and designing things to make the world a better place. Caitlin has now gone on to her first professional job as a designer for a major book publisher--so the Smoking Wyrm is something she does out of love of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nTales from the Smoking Wyrm issue 2 is completely written, with over 75% of the artwork finished already or in commission.

Indeed, many of the tools provided would be useful in any RPG you think suitable for the weird world of proto-neolithic roleplay!\nOUTCASTS\nThe zine contains instructions for generating a band of pariahs - outcasts from mainstream human culture forced into the dangerous wilderness:\n Classless and level-less: develop characters through interaction with the environment, building alliances, developing skills and forging pacts with spirits.\n Lateral development: special curse templates that can lead your characters down unexpected paths including ghoul, jackalwere and blood-drinker... \n Troupe play: control multiple characters, share them until they have grown into themselves, guide them as though you were their ancestral spirits.\n Build a community: foster young charges, care for the old, build the skill base of your pariah band, the better to face the challenges ahead.\n Die: lay down your lie for the good of your allies, knowing that your spirit can assist the fledgling band from the beyond!\nANIMISTS\nEverything is alive: navigate a world where mountains, rivers, trees and even insects possess their own desires and ambitions!\nRules for generating spirits and determining their attitude to the PCs.\nAn original magic system based on conjuring, binding and bargaining with spirits.\nPSYCHEDELIC   \nThis is a time of chaos: rationality has yet to force reality into a fixed form, and the boundaries between the corporeal and ethereal fluctuate...\nSix psychedelic entheogens with unique properties!\nTravel to the spirit world and find the true name of your enemies.\nCreate your own rituals, customs and traditions from afresh: this is a young world, and your characters are defining a new culture!\nSorcerer's Sage: smoke it, speak with the dead.\nNEOLITHIC\nThe PCs begin in the wilderness, but already humans have begun to build the first cities: what are they doing their, and what force guides their hands?\nGenerate thriving, complex neolithic societies to navigate... or avoid!\nTables and generators for technological development and cultural advancement.\nOLD SCHOOL\n Emphasis on player skill over character skill: play as the characters' guardian spirits,  not as the characters themselves.\n Highly lethal: get them out of danger quickly or be prepared to roll up another one.\n Sandbox style play: GMs are encouraged to create situations and challenges, not linear plots. Let the world come alive and happen around the PCs, with or without their participation!\n Rulings not rule: Take your pick of the guidelines within the zine, and fashion them to the tastes of your table. Use the tools for generating a world and populating it with danger and intrigue without being bound by mechanics.\n Familiar: Uses the traditional six ability scores and five saves so easy to pick up and easy to adapt to other old school systems.\nILLUSTRATION\nDiagrams and illustrations throughout by Sofinho and Hoang Minh Nhat.\nProfessional illustrations by Abigail Lingford and Jef Cox: the more funding we get, the more illustrations they will provide!\nTABLES\nTables galore including (but not limited to):\nMagical side effects and mishaps\nMutations and curse templates\nReasons for exile - why your pariahs were banished.\nDeath and dismemberment\nWounds and infections\nPalaeolithic equipment lists\nNeolithic innovations generator\nRandom tribe generator\nWilderness encounters and generators\nNeolithic city generator\nSpirit reaction roll table (and spirit rewards table!)\nPARIAH: ISSUE ONE\nThe printed zine will meet the following specifications:\nForty pages of monochrome text and illustration printed on A5 90 gsm paper. \nBleached white cardstock (180 gsm)  cover \nAs per zinequest 2020 guidelines, the zine is staple bound.\nMake this happen and we'll make a second issue. \nPariah cover (black)\n WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?\nThe bulk of the money raised is used to pay our illustrators Jef, Abigail and Felicia (Nhat). The lead designers (Sofinho and Dzung) are not taking any payment for their work.\nShipping is included in all print orders, wherever you are in the world: there are no additional shipping or delivery fees.\nPrinting costs are our third largest expense. Currently we are planning to print in Vietnam but we may print and ship from the UK for some orders. \nAny additional funds raised will be used to commission more original art/ illustration for the zine. These won't be listed as stretch goals, but if the campaign is successful we will keep you updated regularly.\nIf we are satisfied with the amount of art in the zine and still have funds remaining, we will use this to recruit the services of a high profile professional RPG editor to give an extra layer of polish. We would love to include a professional editor from the outset, but our priority is to get as much high quality art into the zine as we can afford!\nTHE TEAM\nAbigail Lingford - illustration \nHoang Minh Nhat (Felicia) - playtesting, illustration and layout \nJef Cox - illustration\nSofinho (Joey) - playtesting, writing and additional layout\nNguyen Thi Phuong Dzung - playtesting, spreadsheets (!) and additional layout\nFINALLY...\nWe hope you can help us make issue one of Pariah a reality.

I've done thorough research and augmented this with the publicly available advice of Zeshio, Zach from Soul Muppet, and Skerples (Coins and Scrolls) and am 100% certain I can do this with the support of my excellent collaborators. However, I am leading this project and if something DID happen to me it would slow it down a great deal.\n\nThe project is written in its entirety but could do with trimming down. Currently, this edit is something i am doing myself. If sufficient backing is achieved, I have approached a well-known professional RPG editor who will be on board. Even if we do not exceed our funding goal by enough to bring them in, I am still confident I can bring the word count down.\n\nOne can never anticipate events, and it is possible that hold-ups could occur at the printing end of things. I believe I've factored this into the delivery date (for the print edition) of August of this year. All being well, we should be able to get stuff sent out before then. \n\nI'm really excited to be getting this project off the ground. Publishing my own RPG has been a dream of mine since childhood and I will move heaven and earth to make it a reality. With the illustrators and other support I have, I truly believe we can make something special.

But now you're coming of age, and you realize how many troubles have been inside these walls all along: duplicitous courtiers, treacherous kin, and puritanical heresy-hunters. How will you protect yourself and your friends?\nBarrow Keep is a low-prep, old-school setting driven by playbooks and adaptable, easy-to-run scenarios. You play the young residents of the Keep, coming of age while dealing with mysteries, treacheries, and intrigues.\nInspiration & Compatibility\nIn summer 2018, my friend Maria Rivera asked why there weren't any old-school style games for a Game of Thrones-style setting. This project owes a lot to Maria's initial question and her commitment as a reader and playtester. The original game we ran with several other friends was deeply inspired by Beyond the Wall from Flatland Games, TSR's Known World Gazeteer series, and Whitehack by Christian Mehrstam.\nAs the project has continued through several campaigns and one-shots, it's grown past its Ice & Fire roots and been inspired by a wide range of writers of gothic, young adult, historical, and romantic fantasy, including Ellen Kushner, N.K. Jemisin, V.E. Schwab, Lois McMaster Bujold, Tamora Pierce, and Mercedes Lackey.\nBarrow Keep is compatible with:\nOld School Essentials from Necrotic Gnome \nSharp Swords & Sinister Spells by Diogo Nogueira \nThanks to stretch goals, we'll also be releasing materials compatible with:\nBest Left Buried (Print, PDF) from SoulMuppet (See Questing Beast's review)\nTrophy Gold/Rooted in Trophy (Kickstarter, Twitter) from The Gauntlet \nThe Physical Zine\nThe 32-page zine includes:\nProcedures for making your own Barrow Keep, giving each player choices about the Keep's rulers, attendants, and mysteries\nGM advice and pointers focused on running the first session\nA tour of Barrow Keep's locations, factions, and arcane technologies\nA bestiary of the Keep's catacombs and the surrounding woods\nOSR-compatible character and magic options\nThe Barrow Keep: Den of Spies cover by Minerva Fox\nDigital Supplements\nAlong with the zine itself, everyone who backs Barrow Keep will get:\nSeven OSR-style playbooks compatible with Old School Essentials and other OSR systems, including The Hostage, The Spy, The Wielder, The Lost Familiar, The Revenant, and The Wolf\nSeven playbooks adapted for Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells, 2nd Edition \nTwo scenarios set in Barrow Keep: \"Treacherous Kin\" and \"The Changeling Spy,\" compatible with almost any OSR system\nHandouts for players and GMs\nWorksheets and a relationship map for creating your own custom version of Barrow Keep\nReserved PDFs, Watchful Advisers, and Knights Errant\nWe've set aside 25 copies of the PDF zine for $3 for backers who self-identify as students, members of marginalized communities, or experiencing financial hardship.

And this year's #zinequest is the perfect event to drive development and get this GM resource into your hands and campaigns:\n Done-For-You. Pre-built flexible short adventures you can run quickly and easily.\n Segue Adventures. Use the 5 Room Dungeons to organically transition between campaign milestones.\n Drop-In Adventures. Use a 5 Room dungeon when you need something fast because players should've made a left at Albuquerque.\n Raid For Parts. Sometimes you need ideas to help build out your epic plots. Steal the new monsters, magic items, locations, maps, and NPCs from your 5 Room Dungeon zine.\nWhat Are 5 Room Dungeons?\nEvery issue of the zine will contain a complete 5 Room Dungeon (get my free guide via that link) for you to use as standalone adventures, side quests, one-shots, or campaign linchpins.\nA 5 Room Dungeon is an efficient and fun adventure template that generates a complete adventure for a game session. It combines The Hero's Journey literary story structure with RPG game design best practices.\nDespite the name, 5 Room Dungeons can be used for roleplaying, combat, wilderness, city, and underground.\nFor example, there will be one pure NPC roleplay 5 Room Dungeon in the first six issues to demonstrate to you the awesomeness and flexibility of the 5 Room Dungeon format.\nThe Zine\nEvery 5 Room Dungeon Zine issue will contain brand new, custom content to surprise your players with.\nSaddle-stitched on good paper\nColor cover and black & white interior\nAbout 24 pages\nA custom map for GM and a player-friendly version\nA tricky new monster\nA detailed new magic item with lore\nAn exciting new adventuring location\nAt least one new NPC for roleplay\nIn addition, I'm developing each 5 Room Dungeon to have at least one unexpected hook or clever twist to drive interesting new gameplay with your friends.\nFinally, I'll be adding Designer Notes in each zine edition with tips, advice, and ideas on how to run that issue's 5 Room Dungeon for maximum game table impact.

Bloody battles and screams echoed throughout the tower until the killers dispatched the final guard.\nThe surviving murderers succumbed to the last wicked trap, however, and failed to penetrate the cellar's secret.\nBecause of this near miss, the Powers That Be decided to bury the tower and hide its existence. Rumours became legends, and legends faded to dust as 1,000 years passed.\nA recent flash flood has exposed the tower top to sunlight once again, offering up the secret to the first souls brave enough to plunder the dark, water-filled levels haunted by grim horrors and deadly traps.\nCan your players navigate the layered dangers of the Sunken Tower of Angry Shadows and discover its ancient mysteries?\nWhat's Inside 5 Room Dungeons Issue #1\nThe sunken tower offers you a unique adventure location. Each level is flooded with water.\nSmart players might figure out how to drain the tower on level three.\nMeantime, this is a fantastic opportunity for your group to master the swimming and underwater rules through fun gameplay.\nThis 5 Room Dungeon also contains layered threats. Characters must first face the dutiful spirits of assassinated guards bent on protecting the secret even after death.\nThen your players must deal with the murderous souls of slain assassins who still seek what's hidden beneath the cellar.\nDefeating these creatures will require teamwork and skill as the undead are well-suited to the close-quarter, inky dark halls, and flooded chambers of this dreadful place.\nLong-time readers of the Roleplaying Tips Newsletter for GMs will know I always like to offer players two paths.\nThe first path, Combat, is sure to challenge even experienced players. Battling incorporeal foes in small spaces while trying not to drown is no light task!\nThe second path, Roleplay, allows clever players to negotiate their way past guards and assassins if they can piece together the clues to understand what the tower dwellers want and would accept in exchange for letting the characters pass.\nAnd then there's the secret in the basement. What riches await those strong and clever enough to bypass the tower's deadly traps and defenses?\nPOD & PDF Supplied By DriveThuRPG\nBoth PDF and Print on Demand version of 5 Room Dungeons Zine will be fulfilled by DTRPG.\nIf you back a Print Tier, you will just pay for printing and shipping.\nHere are the estimated shipping costs.\nAnd estimated cost for a saddle stitched book is $3-$4.\nI will send you a DTRPG Coupon to redeem for the POD version when ready.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter.

That's over 20 years of weekly tips. In addition, I have produced several books and online courses to help game masters have more fun at every game.\n\nLast, I invented the 5 Room Dungeon method in 2003 and first published it in Roleplaying Tips Newsletter #156.\n\nSo, I've got a firm grasp on what's needed to produce a really cool zine that features brand new 5 Room Dungeons full of twists and crazy gaming moments sure to entertain you and your friends for an evening.\n\n* * *\n\nSome artwork copyright William McAusland and Forge Studios, used with permission.\n\n* * *\n\nI feel risks on this Kickstarter project are very low.

The fantastical imagery and fast playstyle are designed to invoke the classic fantasy and science-fiction adventures tales of old.

You play a Tuzanian, a tribe of jungle-dwelling, vine-swinging, pterodactyl-riding, bone-wielding savages. Radiation leaked from the Invaders' crashed flying saucers spreads on winds of purple, blue, and white, mutating the land and its inhabitants. Meanwhile, a race of turtle-apes and ape-turtles sleeping in stasis beneath the surface awoke...1,000,000 years later than planned. And they were not impressed by the native population \u2013 or the alien Invaders.\n The Bone Age will be a 48+ page saddled stitched book with illustrations by the incomparable Jack Woiak.\nThe Bone Age isn't based on a specific OSR system, but comparisons can be drawn to Swords & Wizardry, Labyrinth Lord, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and Dungeon Crawl Classics. The base mechanic uses a d20 where higher rolls are better than low rolls, and works in a similar fashion to the way saving throws and attacks work in Labyrinth Lord. Thus, an ability might be expressed as 12+, meaning you want to roll a 12 or higher on a d20. Placing the target number in the hands of the players means they get the thrill of shouting \"My attack hits!\" or the agony of lamenting \"I failed my mutation roll,\" as opposed to the Game Master setting a secret Difficulty Class.\nThe Bone Age uses a class & level system, with levels maxing out at 10. The classes you can play are:\n Beast Stalker: hunters of beasts great and small, and the first to encounter the Invaders.\n Marrow Warrior: sentries placed around the perimeter of the Zangatur Jungle, known for their use of the Cleaver, a weapon of serrated bone.\n Mutant: tribe members who developed bizarre mutations after being caught in the radiation winds.\n Untouchable: men and women who tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to challenge their chieftain for rulership of the tribe. They are outcasts, surviving on their own in the deadly jungles.\n Wing Rider: riders of massive flying beasts, whether reptilian, avian, or insectoid in nature.\nWhile most of game mechanics in The Bone Age will seem familiar, there are some things that stand out in contrast to many other games. The most important is the concept of Attunement. The land of The Bone Age \u2013 called Kalsentia \u2013 is itself a living entity, and the creatures that inhabit it can develop a spiritual connection to various geographic regions. These regions are represented by hexes on a map. If you are attuned to a hex, you function more effectively in it. You can attempt to attune to new regions, but you risk the wrath of the land if you offend it \u2013 rock slides, earthquakes, and floods are just some of the signs that you have angered Kalsentia.\nA map of Kalsentia, the Fevered Continent\n I don't want to give away all its secrets, but here is a taste of some of the things you will discover in The Bone Age:\nThe land is brutally hot. The north is dry, the south is humid. Many regions see rain only once per solar cycle.\nWith the exception of the PCs and NPCs, The Bone Age harbors no terran life forms; no horses, no dogs, no bumblebees, no bats, no platypuses.\n The methods necessary to create metal have not been discovered.\nThe bones of ancient creatures litter the landscape. Bone is thus a resource used for a variety of tools, including weapons.\nThree alien ships crashed on the planet one solar cycle ago. Radiation leaks from those ships continues to be carried by the wind, infecting the land and its inhabitants with horrible mutations. The aliens are collectively called the Invaders. \nAdvanced technology has been pilfered from Invader ships and Invader dead. Wise men and women have attempted to understand the strange items, to varying degrees of success. Player-characters will discover Invader tech in various states of repair. The use of these items can be unpredictable, wondrous, and dangerous.\n But of course! \nYep!\nUNLOCKED! $2000:  I will write a 16-page adventure. Anyone backing the $16 tier or higher will receive it as a PDF with a link for an at-cost POD.\nUNLOCKED! $3000: I will create a 12-16 page GM Toolkit, featuring ideas and tables for enhancing your game and making sure you are able to best portray The Bone Age in all its weirdness. Anyone backing the $16 tier or higher will receive it as a PDF with a link for an at-cost POD.\nUNLOCKED! $4000: I will add a second culture along with new classes!\n$5000: Tarot-sized bestiary cards in pdf and at-cost POD for backers of tiers $16+.\n$6000: A second 16-page adventure in pdf and at-cost POD will be created.

Suddenly a nearby patch of void squirms, twists, and rips open, vomiting forth an obscene tentacled horror. A Stellar Squid! Ellie has no time to think--she grabs a lever, twists, and pulls. Instantaneously the metal behemoth she pilots reacts, swinging a giant metal fist at the Squid . . .  \nThe Akashic Titan zine serves as an introduction to the akashic titans, giant metal constructs powered by magic that soar across the endless void, traveling from world to world. In addition to giving an overview of the akashic titans, the zine provides a port city setting, Starnheim, that Judges can work into their Dungeon Crawl Classics games.\nPart 1: Journey to Starnheim describes the rumors that might entice PCs to seek out a hidden market and some of their stops along the way.\nPart 2: The Town of Starnheim gives an overview of a hidden market town, including some of the dangerous factions PCs may encounter there.\nPart 3: Mount Starnheim describes the port where the akashic titans dock and the businesses located there.\nPart 4: The Akashic Titans describes the workings of the akashic titans, including combat rules, an overview of the crew members\u2019 responsibilities, and a sample titan.\nPart 5: The Bands briefly describes the colored Bands that the akashic titans travel through in their journeys across reality.\nAlso included are new monsters (such as the Stellar Squid and Living Constellation), spells (such as Access Akashic Library), and, of course, random tables.\nThe Zine\nAkashic Titan is part of Zine Quest 2. In accordance with the Zine Quest guidelines, Akashic Titan will be a 8.5\u201d x 5.5\u201d staple-bound zine printed in a single color. It will be illustrated throughout. I estimate it will end up being around 60 pages long. It will be printed by Mixam, which has a proven track record of quality printing with excellent turn-around times.\nArt\nIn addition to writing the book I will also do the illustrations. It's going to be a pure, unadulterated creative vision. Here's an example of the artwork: \nAn Akashic Titan\nStretch Goals\nNewly added! Check 'em out!\n$300 - The project is funded. We hit this goal, hurray!\n$1200 - I will add three brand new monsters to the zine: the Permeagon, the Stowaway, and the terrifying Akashic Husk!\n$1500 - A mini-setting, the Elaborate Crystal Palace, a vast and physics-defying structure that floats in the endless void, complete with map, NPCs, and encounter tables!\n What is the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG? \nDungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a sword & sorcery role-playing game published by Goodman Games. Mechanically, DCC is based on the world\u2019s most popular RPG, but the rules have been reforged\u2014streamlined in some places, expanded in others, and injected with a wild and exciting imagination throughout. The fantastical imagery and fast play style are designed to invoke the classic fantasy and science-fiction adventures tales of old. You\u2019ll find the influences of Leiber, Moorcock, Howard, Vance, Brackett, and more throughout Dungeon Crawl Classics.\nFind out more about Dungeon Crawl Classics at www.Goodman-Games.com.\nHow Does an Akashic Titan Work?\nThe akashic titans are not alive, but it is helpful to think of them in terms of the human body. Like a human, an akashic titan needs energy in order to function. The titans are powered by magic.\nIn the belly of the titan is an akashic furnace, which we can think of as the stomach. This is where magic is consumed.\nMagic can be seen as a set of potentials outside the normal operation of the universe. The furnace breaks down the items and frees those potentials, which are then circulated throughout the titan. A system of tubes, pipes, hoses, and wires serves as the titan\u2019s blood vessels, transporting the magical essence throughout its frame.\nSitting in the titan\u2019s head, the Pilot serves as its brain. The Pilot operates a complex system of levers and switches to control the titan\u2019s movements. \nThe levers and switches are not linked to gears and pulleys; rather, the controls are connected by an invisible web of spells, a magical nervous system, and it is the enchantments on the titan\u2019s limbs that cause them to receive the commands and move accordingly.\n\n  Inside the titan\u2019s chest is its heart, a hovering silver sphere that contains a tiny fragment of the Heart of Creation.\n\n  Like a human, an akashic titan must periodically excrete waste. For the titan, this excretory system takes the form of a series of smokestacks that vent toxic steam. The steam is the necessary by-product of stripping magical items of their potential.\nWho Am I?\nHi, I\u2019m Leighton Connor. I have been publishing RPG content for more than 20 years.

Focusing on the Yol'Najj Forest and the surrounding mountain range, the area is known as one of the magical power centers of the world. Recently, a great explosion ruptured part of the mountain range and showered crystals upon the forest, causing chaos and unveiling long hidden mysteries.

You discover the tomb is inhabited by an undead queen and her spectral knights. In your exploration you have learned that she was murdered by the patriarchal structures of her own holy order. The method of her execution has denied her eternal rest. She plans murderous vengeance against the living but offers mercy under two conditions. First, help install her as an eternal monarch upon the religious throne. Second, eradicate the bloodline of those who betrayed her. What do you do? \nDungeons & Dilemmas is a collection of system agnostic techniques for designing dungeon-based adventures that engage the players on an emotional and ethical level. The presented process approaches dungeons as their own unique narrative structure, and the encounters within them as moral puzzles.\nDungeons & Dilemmas treats deeper emotional engagement as an additive dimension of play on top of the exploration, hazard avoidance, monster fighting, and treasure collection elements of traditional fantasy adventure games. All the ideas, tools, and techniques presented speak to the strengths of existing rule systems in common use. GMs and players won't have to hand-wave away or house rule their games to accommodate this material.\nFor several years, I have been using these techniques to keep players emotionally engaged and ethically challenged with adventures that reach beyond the stereotype of \"murder hobos\" and excuses to just \"kill things and take their stuff.\" #ZineQuest has provided a unique opportunity for me to share these ideas with you and hopefully help you think about the dungeon fantasy format in a slightly unique and fulfilling way.\nDungeons & Dilemmas is particularly well suited to games like: \nTorchbearer\nDungeon World\nAny of the numerous OSR-style games such as  Old-School Essentials \nAnd, of course, the current edition of the most popular fantasy adventure game.\nProject Structure\nThe current plan is a 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched booklet with black and white interior.

This booklet is jam packed with page after page of heroic fantasy adventure influenced heavily by early third party RPG badassery like Dave Hargrave\u2019s infamous  Arduin Grimoire series and the early Dragontree Press stuff. The Phylactery is meant to be a quick and easy resource that you can pull ideas and plot hooks from for use directly at your gaming table. There\u2019s no fluff in here and nothing padding out the page count - just pure old school goodness created exclusively for the fantasy gaming community. We have absolutely JAM-PACKED a ton of RPG goodness in here for you. \nIf you're familiar with any of our previous projects like Jungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride or An Occurrence at Howling Crater, then you know exactly what to expect - page after page of high fantasy concepts, OSR flavored ideas and gonzo inspiration delivered in our trademark Grindhouse-style. We WANT you to take what works for you and ditch the rest. Adapt what you like and make the ideas in this booklet your own!\nHere's what you WON'T find inside of The Phylactery - endless charts describing monsters and concepts you've seen a hundred times or a bunch rules that you already have duplicated over a half dozen better-known books. Everything we've put in here is fully intended to generate ideas, spark your imagination, launch new adventures and fill in the little details that make gaming around the table with your friends so memorable in the first place. \nThe focus of the first issue of The Phylactery is one near and dear to my heart - the strange and bizarre! Every Game Master loves to introduce a memorable opponent, watch as players fall afoul of a cursed evil object, discover a nefarious tome of magic, heed the call of forbidden demon-gods and send the players off to dangerous locations haunted by weird monsters, so this booklet has you covered! We've literally jammed this thing FULL from cover to cover.\nThe Throne of Chaos, by Adrian Landeros\nTHE TEAM:\nThe Phylactery is written by Levi Combs, who has published both Jungle Tomb of the Mummy Bride and An Occurrence at Howling Crater through Planet X Games. He also wrote The Horror Out of Hagsjaw for Necromancer Games and has been a contributing writer on several projects for Frog God Games. You can find him at @it_came_from_beyond_planet_x on Instagram.\nEdwin Bickford is a freelance illustrator having done work for both Planet X Games and Frog God Games. In addition to his work on The Phylactery, he is currently illustrating the upcoming Escape from Skullcano Island as well as his own Metal Robot projects. You can find him at @metal_robot on Instagram.\nKarl Stjernberg is a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to RPGs, being not only a talented cartographer and artist, but having credits as both a writer and game designer. His Mutants of Ixx game is one of the coolest, most bad ass games I've ever played. Did I mention he's ridiculously talented and can do it all? His maps (check out the one below... incredible!) are my favorite of ANY genre and ANY artist. You can find him at @skullfungus on Instagram.\nThe Corpse Garden of the Myconid King by Karl Stjernberg\nAdrian Landeros is an uber-talented up and coming illustrator who has done work for a variety of game publishers including Frog God Games, Necromancer Games and Planet X Games. His full color covers and beautiful black and white interiors are equally impressive, but his cover for Escape from Skullcano Island is one of my all time favorite pieces of art for ANY book. You can find him at @ghoster9 on Instagram.\nJe Shields is a freelance illustrator with credits in the RPG industry that reads like a what's what of bad ass projects. His Patreon is one of the best I have ever seen and you can find him at @j_e_shields on Instagram.\nArt by Adrian Landeros\nLawrence Hernandez is one of the most imaginative artists I've ever met. He has done work for both An Occurrence at Howling Crater and the upcoming Escape from Sullcano Island, in addition to numerous artistic projects of his own. It was a real pleasure to have him come on to do the first of many \"Save VS Disbelief\" serial cartoons. You can find him at @lawrence_hernandez_arts on Instagram.\nTracey Steele is the unsung layout and design hero of Planet X Games, since she's the one that makes all these books look so great in the first place. Its been a real pleasure to work with her over so many projects and she brings an enthusiasm and work ethic to these projects that is unmatched. You can find her at @fossiedesign on Instagram.\nIllustration by Ed Bickford\nSTRETCH GOALS\nAs The Phylactery gets funded... it gets bigger! Just like the slobbering monsters grown in a crazed wizard's lab, the bigger it gets, the badder it gets!\n$1000 - A complete 4-page adventure - The Corpse Garden of the Myconid King!\n$1300 - 4 more pages of all-original monsters, fully illustrated and ready to roll in that classic OSR style!\n$1600 - 4 more pages of NPCs that your players are promised to hate... maybe even downright loathe!\n$2000 - 4 more pages of nefarious magical items - the sweet-tooth of every tomb-looting, dungeon-plundering adventurer! \n$2500 - 4 more pages of all new forbidden locations, because what's an adventure without a memorable place to have it in?!\n$3000 - 4 more pages of absolutely gonzo heroic fantasy content. You wanna get weird? LET'S GET WEIRD!\nPHYSICAL REWARDS\nYour shipping is included in your pledge as long as you are a backer in the continental United States. Shipping is processed via media mail. \nWE WILL SHIP INTERNATIONALLY, BUT PLEASE READ BELOW!\nShipping international has become extremely expensive, so expect to pay THE ACTUAL SHIPPING COST to ship your reward. This is the actual shipping cost plus your mailer, calculated online. We strive to be fair, honest and to have integrity, but these international shipping costs are no joke so please note this BEFORE you pledge.\nIllustration by Ed Bickford", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs it currently stands in its 24 page format, this project is 100% written, laid out and edited.

As with any crowdfunding program, the time between payment and delivery of the final product is subject to various risks, including the failure of the supplier, damage in shipment, disruptions within a company, as well as changes in the prices of materials and shipping.\n\nHaving said that, we have a great reputation and a proven track record here on Kickstarter, having always delivered on or before the due date.

In our years in the TTRPG scene we've seen the plethora of talk surrounding the game and the most frequently asked question, \"how do we do *that* in our game at home?\"\nHere's a preview of the opening article written by one of the contributors.\nOn the Shoulders of Colossus will offer several different answers to that question, including a 1-page game, guides/rules for OSR-style Colossi, articles about the game, and guides for creating Colossis in fifth edition dungeons and dragons. \nMatt Harris founded r/DnDBehindtheScreen (under the name FamousHippopotamus) and has been running it ever since. During the time he's released a large body of work for FREE. Click here to see the immensity of their words. They'll be bringing with them their years of experience to write articles on their favorite game and help translate ideas into actionable sources for you at your table.\nJohn Battle has been writing on r/DnDBehindtheScreen (under DeathMcGunz) for several years and is responsible for some of the *weirder* things you might find there. Along with that, they've self-produced/released a few TTRPG books/games, including Songbird and Vultures. They'll be bringing their layout capabilities to produce the PDF and print book, along with their understanding of 5e to create colossi.\nThriftomancer runs the Dice in the North RPG blog and is a regular contributor to Penicillin in a style best described as 'dark woodland surrealism.' She is also responsible for the Crowfoot d4 system. (May the gods have mercy.) For this project she's written pieces on uncovering mysteries and the power of consensus.\n J. Labelle (@sinereous on twitter) is a sea-goth to the core, who focuses on a lot of horror, nature, and folklore art, creating creatures that only they could imagine. They'll be bringing their art skills in to illustrate a full-color cover for the book as well as a few colossi pieces to fit within the text itself.\nHere's a preview of a magic item written up by one of the contributors.\nWe're pairing with the amazing artist J. Labelle (@sinereous) to create a full-color illustration for the cover, as well as monster illustrations to pair with the articles. Their art evokes that mystic wonder that the colossi from the game do, and for that we need some money to pay them. ARTISTS DESERVE GOOD PAY. The money from the kickstarter is going to them with $100 set aside for kickstarter fees, and ordering proofs of the zine.\nWe're only asking for $600 bucks, which sounds do-able,  especially as our first-ever kickstarter. But we still want to offer an incentive to donate beyond the $600 dollars, cause as it stands now, our paychecks on this project are non-existent. So for every $100 dollars donated over the goal, we'll create a fifth edition dnd stat block for a colossus from Shadow of the Colossus. You can see what that looks like below, as the first colossus is already done for the zine.\nThis means if we get $2000 all of the colossi will be made, making the zine an excellent primer for a 5e colossus campaign, taking players from level 1 to 20. Plus everyone writing for the project will get paid $500 bucks for their amazing writing. Any additional money over that mark will go to us and help nudge us towards our best effort.\n\n\nWe wanted to create something special with this kickstarter, especially considering its limited scope in terms of money. So we want to offer you the chance to back at a higher level to receive your own personal Colossus, custom made for your fifth edition dnd campaign, your party, your players, and your level. \nHere's a preview of the 1st colossus of the game turned into a fifth edition dnd stat block, built perfectly for 1st level characters to go and tackle. Each colossus will be laid out in a similar style, with varying colored backgrounds to spice it up.\nWe\u2019ll be fulfilling the printing through Drive Thru RPG, the most popular print-on-demand marketplace for TTRPGs. When the book is proofed and ready, we'll send you a discount that allows you to purchase the print format of your title at the cost of printing. Then you'll input your own address and pay shipping charges during checkout. \nKeep in mind that shipping costs are not added into this kickstarter. You'll pay the shipping costs when you go to check out on DTRPG. DTRPG prints in the U.S. and EU, which should make the costs relatively sane for those of you inside and outside of the U.S.\nFor any questions you can reach out to me on Twitter (@thebestpupper).

Sinister Red is written for use with any fantasy role-playing game system, but is primarily being play-tested with old school style systems, such as The Black Hack and Old School Essentials. Simple stat blocks make it easy to convert the adventure to your system of choice.\nWords, layout, and cartography by Rudy Mangual (@rudyriot). Art by Yvette Lopez.\nWhat's the Story?\nThe players take on the role of motley adventurers thrown into a strange realm in search of treasure, only to discover there is little to exploit and no apparent means to return. Thus their journey quickly becomes one of escape and survival, in a nightmare world of vampiric monstrosities.\nWhat's the Format?\nSinister Red is a point-crawl adventure across a coagulated sea of blood. Adventurers will explore an ominous island with a skeletal coast. Traverse strange and deadly caves. Explore a blasted city and ascend a tower of mirrored glass. \nWhat is a point-crawl?\nA point-crawl is an alternative method for overland adventures. While a typical old school adventure might have the players exploring a hex-map, hex by hex, a point-crawl distills that down to points of interest on the map, with the pathways connecting these nodes mostly predefined. It\u2018s a style I was first introduced to from the Chris Kutalik adventure, Slumbering Ursine Dunes. Here\u2019s a blog post from Chris where he describes the concept in detail:  Crawling Without Hexes by Chris Kutalik \nFeatures\n15-location point crawl across a coagulated ocean of blood\nA subterranean dungeon crawl through the heart of an island\nThe haunted ruins of a once great city to explore\nA mind-boggling tower of mirrors to climb\nTwisted and bloated vampiric monsters and ornery skeletal fiends\nWeird and wonderful magic items and trinkets\nDesperate undying beings, looking to escape their dead world\nSinister Red contains beautiful original art, multiple hand painted maps, and numerous random tables. \nHow Far Along?\nThe majority of the text is written and is currently in play test.

We just want to get funded, and get these copies printed and in the wild. We are however offering a REALLY wacky Adventure as a stretch goal as well as a Troika port of this issue!\n UNLOCKED - $750 - The printing of the first 100 copies of the Zine are funded (as well as kickstarter fees, payment processing fees, income taxes)\n UNLOCKED - $2250 - Digital - FAE Hard Crossover Adventure, written by James A. Pozenel Jr. (with Permission from Shinobi27). Art from James Everett Jackson, David Fisher, Sam Mameli, Matt Cartwright, Diogo Nogueira, & Bradley K. McDevitt. Delivered via DriveThruRPG as soon as it is completed (aka post editing, layout, and content check)\n UNLOCKED - $3750 - Digital - PDF of the Troika Edition of Issue 2! Delivered via DriveThruRPG as soon as it is completed. (aka post writing, editing, layout, and content check)\n UNLOCKED - $4800 - DIGITAL PDF- THE DROP COMMENCES - Go back to when it all started. When the bat god became self aware. When satellite technicians became as mages. When whispers gained legs. When Goliaths tore down walls. When the Stratosfiend first showed their cyclopean visages. At this level we will send out issue 1 as a PDF to all backers of the PDF and higher. (And the troika one too)\n UNLOCKED - $5000 - DIGITAL PDF - ALL HAIL THE ELEVATOR GOD - Witness as Razor-Worn lashes the universe with her elevators, and the full rage of the Cosmic Gantry. Watch as Acceptance, the Organ-Fractal mutates space itself. Join the Comm-Artist as they call life into traps, and make new ones.  At this level we will send out issue 1.5 as a PDF to all backers of the PDF and higher.\n UNLOCKED - $5250 - DIGITAL - Upgrade to FAE HARD CROSSOVER. A very special 2 Page spread from Sam Mameli. I can definitively say that it HOWLS (because it\u2019s a bunch a seekers of the scourge that serve exiled Goliaths Death-Engines).\n LOCKED - $6750 - DIGITAL PDF - NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES. Zach at SoulMuppetPublishing will convert all of  the \u201cTerror of the Stratosfiend\u201d bestiary entries (across 1, 1.5, & 2... about 18 entities) to be compatible with Best Left Buried.\nLOCKED - $7550 - DIGITAL PDF -  A Stratosfiend\u2019s Travels : A giant\u2019s guide to traveling cities, canals, and tunnels, written by Michael T. Lombardi.  Some people have wondered how a 20 foot alien can dungeon crawl... let\u2019s find out!\n LOCKED - $8350 - DIGITAL PDF - Paradigm of the Infinite Swords, with art by Matthew Cartwright.

The lake is framed by weeping willow trees, their vines pouring into the lake\u2019s shores. Willow is not what one would call an upbeat town. The rains here are relentless and the grey skies loom low like a giant cage. Travelers do not linger here long; one night in the Blue Brew Inn is enough to make most jump on the ferry and move on. But recently the ferries have stopped running as something terrible has taken up residence upriver. Meanwhile, the town residents will not talk about the noises echoing up from the staircase that descends below the lake, nor the broken stone circle on the hill at the edge of town. The town's leader, a witch named Morose Morgan, is a recluse and refuses to leave her island and answer any questions from travelers. \nWillow is a mini hexcrawl and players will have to work to investigate a mystery to move on from this damp backwater town to bigger, brighter places. \nHooks and rumors for players\n5 Keyed Hex Locations\nRandom encounter tables for different areas\nNew monsters and monster factions \nAn aquatic themed dungeon\nNPC generator \nNPC relationship web\nKey NPCs with desires, fears and mannerisms\nA mystery to be solved upriver\nA shop and inn\nTown history\nOrganization structure for the society of the town\nChanges and sets of events that happen over time\nNew magic items, including magical plants and insects\nFlow charts for how the village will react to different actions players take \n\nTrim size : 5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d \n100gsm paper stapled with 130gsm cardstock cover \nColor printing (but almost entirely one color)\nPrinted with Mixam \n32 or more pages\nThe PDF will have hyperlinks and bookmarks\nThe design goals for Willow are to make a zine that has a focus on:\nModular design\nGame-able content\nEasy to pick up and run with little DM prep\nA lot of art and graphics to cut down on text\nA dark fantasy fairytale theme\nCreating a memorable town that can be used as a starting town for campaigns\nIf you pledge at level 3 than you get some original hand-drawn artwork from the zine mailed to you.

The Creator reward includes the maps as 300dpi PNG and TIFF files to make this easier.\nThe back cover is set up to handle address labels, so they'll be sticker-sealed shut and sent through the mail naked since that seemed very Zine to me. \nFor those international backers who want a physical copy, I'll put it in an envelope and send it that way since I don't trust the rigors of international postal delivery to be overly kind to a simple paper booklet. \nIf there are US backers who would prefer their zine be mailed in an envelope I'll provide that option during the post-campaign survey. I'd only ask that you add $3 to your pledge to cover the envelope and additional postage.\nThanks for checking out my project!\nStretch Goals\n$750 - a bonus map will be added to the digital version - Added!

A band of thieves has taken shelter within the manor's crumbling walls, cowering with their ill-gotten poultry as the building shakes itself apart. But something else is stirring. The giant's rampage has woken a group of revenant knights from their black slumber in the manor's crypt, and they have called the bones of the manor's old residents to their side in an effort to drive out the intruders.\nWill the party manage to loot the manor of its ancient relics, or succumb to the blades of its skeletal guardians?

It's designed to work as a one-shot, or to be dropped directly into a pre-existing campaign setting. Its focus is on ease of use, high interactivity, and a dangerous environment that rewards clever play.

It's inspired by my campaign, mixed with new material. I use old school gaming philosophies, meaning  save vs. death is in play, and bringing home a buttload of silver is the best way to get xp.  \nHunters in Death is designed for low level play using any \"Old School Renaissance\" compatible game system. As such, don't expect much by way of balance.  This sage advice was once overheard in a local watering hole in Hounds Head:  \"A wiser fella than myself once said, sometimes you eat the bear....sometimes the bear, well, he eats you.\"\nHunters in Death Cover\nHunters in Death is set in the Komor Forest. A place that's consumed civilizations and birthed abominations. Yet there is a single outpost, Hounds Head, that holds back the darkness. It's a beacon for adventurers. Silver and blood are promised. And delivered. Some adventurers return with sacks overflowing with coins and jewels, but most fertilize the forest with their blood.\nAdventure is only a rumor away at the tavern, a trusting resident's plea for help, or by striking out into the forest to explore the many ancient ruins. There is no path to follow, no road less traveled. Forge your own path with steel and magic. Nature does not negotiate.    \nWhat lies beneath the Komor Forest?\n About the Artist: Jim Magnusson, The Mad Swede. He's the artist I think of when I want twisted, disturbing, and nightmarish pieces. His artwork alone is worth the price of admission. He did all the art for Hunters in Death. That, is a very good thing. \nLet's talk about what's inside: This is a glimpse into how I run a campaign. I've run games for over 41 years, and like every game master in existence, I've created my own rules and mechanics. I provide a list of these rules/mechanics to provide a sense of immersion particular to the Komor Forest. Then you'll find Hounds Head, a place for the party to get information, get henchmen, get supplies, sell stuff, and rest until their next adventure. Then what follows is an array of adventures. The adventures aren't meant to be played in any order. While the adventures are separate there are connections between some of them. Within the adventures there are new magic items, new spells, new monsters, and new artifacts. And any old school gaming zine wouldn't be complete without random tables. Yeah, it's got some of those. \nIf you're curious about my work you can check out my Patreon.

Ward brings you Doom on the Warden, a Metamorphosis Alpha adventure of horror in space. The adventure includes pre-generated characters, and is playable as part of a campaign or as stand-alone play. Doom on the Warden is a new frontier for Metamorphosis Alpha, in both style and substance, and for the first time the pre-generated characters include wolfoids.\nFloating Above the Starship Warden...\nThink you know everything about the starship Warden?\nThink again!\nIt was a little-known fact that the colonization starship Warden had many discrete safeguards and catastrophe protocols in place should complications arise during its long voyage. These safeguards proved insufficient to protect the Warden when it encountered the radiation cloud. When the ship\u2019s computers analyzed the impending threat, the military A.I. enacted the Omicron Protocols, causing a portion of the ship\u2019s dorsal hull to disengage. This portion, hidden within the Warden\u2019s outer bulkhead, contains the classified military cantonment, code named \u201cLevel 0.\u201d\nUncontrollably drifting through uncharted space, mankind\u2019s first colonization starship Warden has survived for over 300 years. While floating through the interstellar dark, strange civilizations have arisen - mutant, human, and wolfoid. Battles have been fought, wars have been waged, and finally the end is near\u2026if anyone survives. The moment has come to repair the Warden and return it on its course \u2013 or to disable it forever.\nIn 1976, TSR published Metamorphosis Alpha, the very first sci-fi RPG, written by James M. Ward.\nIn 2014, Goodman Games worked with Mr. Ward to re-release Metamorphosis Alpha in a deluxe hardcover edition.\nIn 2016, Goodman Games released Epsilon City, the largest expansion to Metamorphosis Alpha since its debut.\nNow, in 2020, James M. Ward is back with an adventure to rival the deadliest crafted by the mind of Gary Gygax, Tomb of Horrors. Goodman Games brings you Doom on the Warden, the adventure that changes Metamorphosis Alpha forever!\nColor cover edition of Doom on the Warden\nAbout the Product\nSince the release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the starship Warden has continued unchanged, but that ends now. Doom on the Warden is the first-ever official Metamorphosis Alpha adventure that continues the story and answers the question\u2026What next?\nFormat: Doom on the Warden will be published as an 8.5\u201dx11\u201d hardcover, with an estimated length of 32-48 pages. (This will likely grow with stretch goals.) The hardcover is available with a color cover, or in a gold foil edition. \nAuthor: Mr. James M. Ward is the creator of Metamorphosis Alpha and a 44-year veteran of the gaming industry, with prior creative credits that include Gamma World as well as many D&D products during his time as a creator and Vice President with TSR. Mr. Ward has already completed the manuscript, expanding on materials, playtests, and notes built over a lifetime of gaming, including some that trace back even to his famed original campaign.\nContent: Doom on the Warden is packed with the answers to the starship Warden\u2019s biggest mysteries!\nThe Adventure: James M. Ward\u2019s most devious adventure ever! Part hex crawl, part deadly delve. Forty-four years after the original release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the second half of the voyage is finally being told.\nCampaign-Style Play: Drop this adventure into your ongoing campaign to turn everything on its head. Complacent denizens of the starship Warden will find themselves racing to uncover the deepest of the Warden\u2019s secrets, and to restore its course.\nConvention-Style Play: Three teams of pre-generated characters, each with their own individual reasons for undertaking this deadly quest, are ready to populate your table as the adventure was originally run.\nThe Maps: A map of the mysterious \u201cLevel 0\u201d and the military command dome found within.\nWhat is Metamorphosis Alpha?\nMetamorphosis Alpha is the original science-fiction tabletop role playing game in which the players are passengers on the interstellar colony ship Warden. Struck by radiation, the ship\u2019s occupants have mutated into unusual and deadly creatures. After several generations, civilization has been cast into ruins, and there is little knowledge of how to use the technology of the Warden. Reduced to tribal barbarians, they must struggle to survive amidst a backdrop of advanced technology, mutant monsters, and the vast spaces on an intergalactic colony ship.\nNeed a copy of the original rules? Goodman Games publishes a Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, which reprints the original 1976 first edition rules set. The collector\u2019s edition also reprints all the original Dragon magazine material for Metamorphosis Alpha, and has new content as well. It is available as both a softcover and deluxe oversized hardcover edition, as well as a foil oversized hardcover, and can be purchased as an add-on to this campaign.\nFoil cover edition of Doom on the Warden (mockup)\nWhat is Doom on the Warden?\nAt its core, Doom on the Warden is a horror story. Characters enter a strange, secluded location and are immediately confronted by incomprehensible foes who often strike without warning. Mad voices taunt them and, no matter how prepared the characters think they are, they are in truth out of their depth. Whether it is the primal dread of the shroud of darkness or the maddening uncertainty that vital equipment will work when called upon, the referee should emphasize the horrific elements of each region, seeking to unsettle not only the characters but the players themselves.\nThe adventure expands on the mysterious involvement of Earth\u2019s military aboard the starship Warden, previously mentioned in The Warden Armory and the Goodman Games Gazette. There is new information on what happened in the Warden\u2019s early days. Unraveling the mystery sends the characters through 4 distinct geographical regions, into the secret military command dome, and beyond. Along the way, they will be confronted by threats old and new across 54 possible encounter areas.\nThe Stretch Goals\nWe love Metamorphosis Alpha as much as you, so we\u2019ve outlined a series of stretch goals to elevate your experiences aboard the starship Warden. Here is the breakdown of stretch goals, which may evolve over the course of the campaign:\nStretch goal #1 ($7,000): CLEARED! First set of printable reference cards. There are 100+ creatures, weapons, and items to encounter in this adventure. We would like to create simple cards to summarize them for players and judges alike. These will be provided in PDF format and can be printed for use in game. This first stretch goal will cover creation of approximately 30 such cards, which should encompass most of the weapons in this adventure. \nStretch goal #2 ($12,000): CLEARED! Two new colored metal arm bands available as add-ons. First launched in our previous Metamorphosis Alpha projects, these metal arm bands mimic the control bands in the original game. These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. At this stretch goal, we will manufacture two kinds of new bands: the bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory). These will be add-ons available at $10 each.\nStretch goal #3 ($15,000): CLEARED! Second set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should be enough to cover most of the items encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal! ($19,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Level of the Lost! \nStretch goal #4 ($22,000): CLEARED! Printed endsheets with great art to adorn them!\nBonus stretch goal! ($24,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Android Underlords and Warden Adventures. \nBonus stretch goal! ($26,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Robots Among Us. \nStretch goal #5 ($27,000): CLEARED! Third set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should cover most of the monsters, mutants, and robots encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal ($29,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Mutation Manual.\nStretch goal #6 ($35,000):CLEARED!A sewn-in satin ribbon bookmark to hold your place when you run the adventure.\nStretch goal #7 ($45,000): Expanded page count on the printed books to include some or all of the reference cards. There are some printing parameters we'll have to verify but the goal is to get most or all of the reference cards printed and bound into the book.\nAnd beyond that...who knows?\nDoom on the Warden color arm bands (mockup)\nAdd-Ons\nThere are so many ways to support this Kickstarter!\nAdd-On Items from Previous Metamorphosis Alpha Projects: You can add any of the below print items to help support the Kickstarter and achieve stretch goals.\n Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, softcover edition, $30\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover edition, $80\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover gold foil edition, $120\n Metamorphosis Alpha deck plans illustration, 24\"x36\" poster, $20\n The Android Underlords (adventure), $10\n The Captain\u2019s Table (adventure), $10\n The Level of the Lost (adventure), $10\n Death Ziggurat in Zero-G (adventure), $10\n Warden Adventures (scenarios), $10\n What are the Prisoners of Rec-Loc-119?

These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. Backers of Doom on the Warden will be able to add on bracelets at a cost of $10 each! We will do a fresh production run to meet demand. \nThe colors available are based on the previous two Metamorphosis Alpha Kickstarters, plus the two new ones from Doom on the Warden, and include all except the rare command band. The available colors are:\nFrom the original Metamorphosis Alpha: civilian (brown), ecology (green), security (red), engineering (gray), and medical (white) bands.\nFrom Epsilon City: military (black), programmer (yellow), sciences (light blue), administration (dark blue).\nFrom Doom on the Warden: bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory).\nAdditional bands may be unlocked via stretch goals. Quantities are limited!\nPlease note: the arm bands must be shipped separately from books and will have a small incremental shipping charge applied after the Kickstarter (roughly equivalent to an extra $1-$2 per armband depending on destination.)\nTimeline for Release\nDoom on the Warden is scheduled to ship in September of 2020. Many of our previous Kickstarters have expanded significantly in scope as successive stretch goals are cleared. If this project expands significantly with new stretch goals, we will provide an update on release date.\nShipping & Handling\nShipping and handling costs are not included in the pledge levels. At the end of the Kickstarter, Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced via BackerKit. This allows us to add on stretch goals as the project expands. Expected cost of shipping/handling may change if the project evolves from a single hardcover. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run many Kickstarters and all have been successfully fulfilled.

It details The Empire Without Borders or Competition, a vast and slowly crumbling empire.\nThe text will contain two new classes\u2014the Juggernaut and the Psychic\u2014four new deities, new rules for psychic powers, a new Mothership character sheet, and everything else you need to start a campaign.\nThis will be a limited edition release! Only 150 copies are available through this Kickstarter. 100 others will be available through the Melsonia webstore after this campaign concludes. Any remaining copies of the 150 will be sold through the Exalted Funeral webstore. Post-Kickstarter copies will be sold for roughly $20 plus shipping. PDFs will continue to be available after the Kickstarter through various webstores, save at an increased price.\nNow, due to widespread demand there is also a wider printing that will be digitally printed by Mixam. This printing will have all of the same content, but will be printed differently and will be bound by staples, not thread.\nFormat\nBlood Floats in Space will be a 5\" by 8\" booklet with a full color cover and a thirty-two page black & white interior. We'll be working with Risolve Studio to use risograph printing\u2014a unique method that utilizes soy-based ink\u2014which will also allow us to have more vibrant colors and deeper blacks. The cover will be 67lb vellum bristol and the interior will be 57lb paper stock. It will also be saddle sewn,  not stitched, with a red thread spine, making it more durable and allowing it to lay flat. Risograph is hand-made and unpredictable; every copy of Blood Floats in Space will be slightly different, and the cover and interiors will look slightly different from what is shown on this page.\nIn summary, this will be a high quality and eco-friendly print product, with vibrant colors, nice paper, and a durable binding.\nBudget\n $950: Paying to print 250 copies\n $300: Paying Matt Hildebrand for his work on layout\n $100: Paying Fiona Geist for her work creating random tables\n $150: Kickstarter platform fees\nPrinting a high-quality product costs a lot of money, but we\u2019ve already done the legwork needed to find fair prices for the book. All of the artists have already been paid, and the manuscript is being edited during the Kickstarter. All that is left is just layout and sending the files to the printer.\nAdd Ons\nThere will be a few add ons available for this project through BackerKit, namely print copies and PDFs of previous Apollyon projects. Additional print copies of the Blood Floats in Space Mixam version will be available for $8 and additional shipping for people who have already backed for a print copy. Also, the digital backlog (Phantasmagoria #1 and 2, Extinguish the Sun #1 and 2, and On the Shoulders of Giants) will be available as an $8 add-on.\nShipping\nShipping will be handled by Exalted Funeral, a store and publisher of role-playing games. You can check out their website here.\nCurrently, shipping for one print copy within the United States is estimated at $3. Shipping multiple copies or international orders will be more expensive. We will be collecting shipping via BackerKit soon after the campaign closes.\nStretch Goals\nAs this is a project with a limited scope, a specific format, and a tight deadline, there will not be any stretch goals for this project. Instead, any additional funds raised will go towards giving additional (well-earned) compensation to the contributors and towards continuing to publish weird books.\nCreative Team\nWe've assembled an amazing creative team in order to make this project work, portraying a different interpretation of Mothership than the already fantastic Tuesday Knight Games products, while maintaining the same level of killer quality.\nChance Phillips: Chance is the primary author and creative force behind this book and will also be handling the publishing side. Previous writing includes the first two issues of Phantasmagoria for Dungeon Crawl Classics and On the Shoulders of Giants (both of which were successfully Kickstarted) and work on several projects for other independent game companies.\nMabel Harper: Mabel contributed additional material on the various religions of the setting as well as the leader of the galactic government. You may have seen Mabel's previous work in GMDK's The Demon Collective Vol. 1 or on her blog, a blog full of demons.\nFiona Geist: Part of the editing collective the MoonRat Conspiracy, Fiona is contributing d% random tables to help create the setting and to spark player and the warden imaginations. Fiona also contributed writing to both Mothership's Player's Survival Guide and Dead Planet as well as Phantasmagoria #3.\nMatt Hildebrand: If you read or play indie OSR games, you've probably seen Matt's work before, whether in Gavin Norman's Wormskin zine, Mike Evan's Barbarians of the Ruined Earth, or in a variety of others. Matt is handling layout and graphic design.  \nSample layout (subject to change)\n Tyler Crumrine: Tyler has edited several Apollyon products including On the Shoulders of Giants and Phantasmagoria #2 & #3 as well as RPG titles for such companies as World Champ Game Co. and Knight Owl Publishing. As editor, Tyler will be making sure everything in the book reads well and is easy to use at the table.\nAndrew Walter: Well known in RPG circles for his extensive work with the Melsonian Arts Council on Troika!, Crypts of Indormancy, and Fever Swamp, Andrew's metal-infused vision is perfect for the setting. Andrew created the killer cover artwork for Blood Floats in Space.\nCheck out more of Andrew's weird illustrations here!\nStefan Poag: Fans of Dungeon Crawl Classics will instantly recognize Stefan's art from a wide range of Goodman Games' products, in addition to previous Apollyon projects like Phantasmagoria and Slave, Soldier, and King. Stefan created a full-page illustration detailing the fearsome war machines present in the setting. \nCheck out more of Stefan's cool work here!\nScrap Princess: A talented illustrator and monster designer who worked with Chance on On the Shoulders of Giants, Scrap created illustrations for the deities of the different faiths in the setting. \nCheck out more of Scrap's idiosyncratic style here!\nJim Magnusson: A regular contributor on Apollyon products, Jim created several interior illustrations for the book. In addition to issues of Phantasmagoria, you may have also seen his work in Glynn Seal's The Midderlands, Lamentations of the Flame Princess' Sounds of the Mushroom Kingdom, or several other publications.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the art is already complete, as is 95% of the writing, so there is minimal risk with this project. Plus, Tyler will be working on editing it during the Kickstarter. All that's left after the Kickstarter concludes will be layout and then printing, and this team is quite experienced with delivering Kickstarters.

It will be black & white softcover, 8.5x11\", and printed at  Mixam. It will have more tables than you can actually use, filled with original art and old illustrations. The PDF will be distributed through DriveThruRPG.\nStatus\nI've commissioned and paid for a couple illustrations, but I 'd like to get a lot more. I've been talking and planning with several artists.

You did it. The last minute pledges put us over the 90K mark and unlocked the last 3 Deck Expansions! Thank you all! Thank you for joining us on this journey and helping bring James Ward's vision to life. And that is what this is is, the Starship Warden as James M. Ward envisioned it so many years ago. You've helped him, co-author Christopher Clark (of Inner City Games) and TLG bring this project to life. Trollzah! And thank you again!\nCLICK ON THE MAP IMAGE FOR A SAMPLE OF THE WARDEN! OR JUST CLICK HERE!\nNear the beginning of the 24th century, humans began the largest construction ever undertaken by their species. Larger than most cities, the project was forty-nine miles long, twenty-four miles wide, and more than six miles in height. The manufacture of this colossus required decades of labor by thousands of skilled craftsmen. It was a feat unequaled in human history at that time. Too large to be manipulated in planetary atmosphere and gravity, this behemoth was built in earth's orbit. It was developed to provide safety for more than a million souls and was to be filled with myriad forms of life.\nPacked with the latest technology available at the time, the starship was capable of 90% of the speed of light. A trip to Alpha Centauri was but a mere 6 years. A host of other systems were well within reach, and this vessel was to take humanity to the stars. The planning for this mission was meticulous, the courage of her crew unquestionable, and the hopes of mankind ever present. She was named the Warden after her designer, and she set off for the stars in the late 24th century.\nLess than two decades into her mission, she simply disappeared. There has now been no word from the Warden for more than 300 years....\nThe Starship Warden is a sandbox adventure setting written by James M. Ward and Christopher Clark.  It is intended for use with the StarSiege RPG, a Siege Engine game, (Free with this Kickstarter). But, if you are loyal to the old MA, don't despair, the Starship Warden is written to allow you to use your original Metamorphis Alpha Rules and begin a lifetime worth of play. The Starship Warden is a 650+ page black and white, hard cover book that will retail for $74.99, the digital version of the book will retail at $20.00. An interstellar starship, set adrift, with 17 monstrous decks to explore, hordes of creatures and mutants, treasures both fantastic and scientific, it is a world within a ship. A setting like no other.\nAll 17 Fully detailed Decks with all environmental conditions\nThe dome, or 18th level\n16 Levels set between the decks\nLegacy Humans the descendants of the original crew\nCryogenically frozen humans\nMutated Plants and animals\nSurviving but evolved species \nRobots, Androids and new tech\nA host of maps (18 deck and dome maps, 16 crawlway maps and scores of smaller maps\nMonsters and mutants\nWeapons and equipment\nThe Crawl-ways\nThe Starship Warden is a project long in the works. Originally the Starship appeared in James M. Ward's Metamorphis Alpha RPG, published in the bygone days of the 1970s. It has seen many iterations since then. Appearing in countless books and pubs, however, it has never been presented fully fleshed out and as its creator, James Ward, envisioned it. \nNow, for the first time, decades after its creation, The Starship Warden comes to life in all its 17 levels and as its master architect designed it.\nHelp us launch this world within a ship. \nThe Starship Warden is written and laid out. We'll comb through it one more time and do some superficial content work on it, but the book only needs printing.\nRULES SAMPLE: For those seeking more clarity on which version of MA it is compatible with or how hard it will be to adjust to playing with the Siege Engine, here are four pages form the book to help you out! RULES SAMPLE!\nUsing the Starship Warden\nThe Starship Warden is a world contained within the massive Warden...itself about 49 miles long. It is designed for use with StarSiege, a Siege Engine RPG fully compatible with Amazing Adventures and Castles & Crusades. For those who would rather use the original Metamorphosis Alpha rules as published in 1977, you can so do with only slight modifications. Not familiar with MA? Check out the Goodman Games website for more information, they publish a version of the original game as originally published. Some slight modifications and you can be off and running.\nGet a taste of how easy StarSeige is (but before you do, remember this is just the preview and does not have full character creation and equipment etc. That will come later):  DOWNLOAD THE PREVIEW OF STARSEIGE! \nWhat is on the Starship?\nThe Starship itself is 49 miles long and 24 wide and was originally designed to house, feed and clothe over a million people. To do this the ship was outfitted to serve as a home for people with quarters and cafeterias, restaurants and malls all intermingled with a host of features to mimic earth-like conditions, from artificial lakes to fields of crops. Her maiden voyage began with hopes and dreams of a future like nothing humanity had ever seen.\nBut that was long ago. All contact with the earth was lost and the ship set adrift in the deeps of space. There, things went awry and technology corrupted some and empowered others. Supplies dwindled, the environment fractured and the ship's inhabitants were thrown into a world of want and need. So it has been for long centuries. A world now of madness and despair, where mutants hunt humans, where machines grind away the last shreds of what we call the self and people strive to carve a living out of the wreckage in a world whose purpose few remember.\nIt is your time now. Rise in the chaos of the Warden and bend its apocalypse to your will -- or be ground away to nothing.\nAbout James M. Ward and Christopher Clark\nJames M.

And the slipcase proves to be a fantastic way to store and transport these books if you find it handy to keep them outside of your Black Cube.\nWe don't have any extra Book M slipcases, so we can\u2019t currently make them available as a standalone item for Invisible Sun players. You could purchase a second copy of Book M, but that\u2019s an expensive proposition if you only want the slipcase, and a waste of the book and cards that come with it.\nBut we here at MCG find the slipcase astonishingly handy for this purpose! Would you agree? Would you also like one? We don\u2019t know, so that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter.\nProducing a short print run of slipcases is relatively expensive and disruptive to our production pipeline. We only want to do it if gamers really want the slipcase. We think the slipcase is awesome, but without any sense of how many Invisible Sun players would like one, having them made is a risk of time and resources we have other uses for.\nBut if enough Invisible Sun players support this campaign to make a print run of the slipcase viable, we\u2019ll make them. That\u2019s it\u2014that\u2019s the entire purpose of this Kickstarter campaign. There are no advanced pledge levels and no stretch goals. We are not promoting the campaign beyond the circle of gamers who are already invested in Invisible Sun. It\u2019s running for a short period of time only.\nThe intention is simply to determine if there are enough Black Cube owners who would like a slipcase to make it worthwhile. We may print a few extras to offer for sale on the MCG Shop, but if so quantities will be extremely limited. If you\u2019d like a slipcase, the only sure way to get one\u2014the only sure way to ensure that they get made at all\u2014is to pledge now. Your slipcase will ship to you in February.
