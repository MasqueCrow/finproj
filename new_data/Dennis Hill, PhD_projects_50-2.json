[{"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Accession was formed from the question, \"Can it ever be a good idea to 'brick' your own computer?\"\nYES, YES IT CAN.\nThe focus of this project is to build a prototype of Accession.\n\nWhy Not Use Hardware AND Software to Protect Your Data?\nAccession is a different way of looking at security for your computer. It is a combined hardware and software solution designed to make your computer completely inaccessible when you are not using it, employs a philosophy of compartmentalization in design, integrates a multitude of security software to help protect it AND utilizes a USB \"key\" to run it.\n\nHardware Designed for Security\nThe building blocks of Accession start with the hardware. Accession will be built utilizing three separate encrypted solid state drives; one to store specialized operating system files (not actual operating systems) and two additional drives to store daily backups and hourly snapshots.\nVisual Representation of the USB \"Key\"\nAt the core of Accession is a USB flash drive that it uses as a \"key\". This flash drive houses RiseOS, our own operating system that runs the entire computer. When this \"key\" is removed, it \"bricks\" the computer, making your data completely inaccessible as there is no operating system to hack.\nImagine being able to physically secure your computer in something as simple as a lock box when your work day is over. Accession allows you to do this and more. These \"keys\" can even be assigned to workers or employees if multiple people use the same computer.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nIntegrated Software Solutions\nAccession doesn't only rely on its unique structure for security, it will contain software solutions to help protect your data. This includes encryption on all hard drives, automated primary and secondary remediation systems to recover your entire computer in the event of a catastrophic viral infection (including ransomwares!) or other disastrous failure, real-time monitoring and a data loss prevention (DLP) system.\n\nCompartmentalization\nCompartmentalization- the division of something into sections or categories. Also a military term for separating the details of an operation between operatives to prevent the entire operation from being compromised if any one operative is captured.\nThis is the philosophy behind Accession.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nAccession not only compartmentalizes your data through hardware means, but also through software. Accession will have the ability to run multiple, separate operating systems within RiseOS. These can either be a transplanted, existing installation or a fresh installation.\nActual Screenshot of Accession\nThis means your current computer, programs AND data can be transferred to Accession with NO loss of functionality!\nThis compartmentalization combined with all your data separated between three encrypted physical locations, which are only accessible through the USB \"key\", decreases the chances of any of your data becoming compromised.\n\nThe Project As It Sits Now\nAs of the writing of this project, we currently have two \"working models\" of Accession (NEITHER is an actual prototype, as these \"working models\" are not built using the planned form factor, CPU, RAM or hard drive specifications of the actual proposed prototype system, however, RiseOS is installed on,and working from,a USB flash drive on both \"working models\"). These \"working models\" were built so we could begin the coding and building of the operating system and additional security features, and to start preliminary testing. The images above contain actual screenshots of RiseOS. We added the monitor to make it look fancy. We have secured a vendor, and contacted numerous others, to manufacture the prototype computer (without the operating system) and the finished systems.\nRiseOS is roughly 60% complete as of this writing. It is based on another operating system, SanctumOS, we created, so the basics are already in place, what is remaining to complete is additional in-depth coding to enhance the security software and remediation systems and to tighten up the look and feel of the operating system to make it more familiar and user-friendly.We are also developing a simpler graphical interface for unlocking the encrypted drives.\nThe \"working models\" of Accession have gone through preliminary testing of the primary and secondary remediation systems against ransomware infections; specifically Petya, NotPetya, WannaCry and Ryuk. We believed this was essential to complete as soon as possible as this is a primary feature of Accession. These remediation plans have been used successfully on other solutions offered by Archai Solutions, LLC, but not with this complex of a design. They have performed admirably in all preliminary tests and recovered 100% from each infection. The recovery process took between 45 and 53 minutes depending on the infection and whether it was the primary or secondary remediation system. We project that the actual prototype recovery time will be quicker due to the higher proposed hardware specifications. We will be uploading a screen capture of a ransomware infection on Accession and the recovery process through the primary remediation system once the security coding is more complete, roughly within the second week of April. (this video will be edited ONLY for time constraints. We don't believe ANYONE wants to sit through a 53-minute video of a bar slowly moving across the screen, although we will make the complete, unedited video available to any backer who wishes to see it. [UPDATE: The video actually ended up being 87 minutes, see our UPDATES]). The secondary remediation system does take the computer out of the operating system, so doing a screen capture of this remediation system will be a little difficult. This secondary remediation system is planned only to be used as a last ditch recovery system.\n\nPlans for Funding\nThe funds we are raising will be used for the following:\n-  The materials for, and construction of, an actual prototype system, this includes all the proposed hardware (i.e. form factor shell, CPU, motherboard, RAM, hard drives and USB drive);\n-  The hiring of one or two additional employees for additional coding, both controlled-environment and \"real world\" testing, and other responsibilities;\n-  The filing of a provisional patent and of the actual patent once Accession is completed;\n-  Expenses associated with testing Accession in a \"real world\" business environment. This includes the cost of commonly used business software such as Quickbooks, MySQL, CRM software, etc. to ensure Accession does not inhibit any such software;\n-  Expenses associated with testing Accession within different business network structures. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual servers, VPNs, networked drives, NAS systems, cloud storage, cloud computing, etc.;\n-  The writing, editing and printing of a \"quick start\" user's manual and the creation of a troubleshooting website;\n-  An additional \"slush\" fund for unexpected expenses. We have tried to take into account any and all expenses associated with this project, but as any creator or developer will tell you, there is always something unexpected that appears.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks:\n We are not new to technology. Our team of two have a combined 57 years working with, building and designing computers, hardware and software. We are fully versed in multiple forms of coding for Windows and Linux. Josh started his own computer repair and service company, Trust Tech Management (www.trusttechmanagement.com), in 2015 geared towards providing honest, inexpensive and quality computer services for small businesses and residential users. Realizing there was a need for innovative cybersecurity solutions for small businesses, he started Archai Solutions, LLC (www.archaisolutions.com) unofficially in 2020 and officially in 2021, with the philosophy that standard cybersecurity techniques were not working and new, revolutionary solutions were needed. If the accepted solutions were enough, hackers and ransomware attacks would not be the threat they are.\n\n We have been working hard to ready Accession for Kickstarter, but life is nothing if not unpredictable. Here are the risks we foresee and our plans for assessing them:\n\nCURRENT SILICON SHORTAGE: With everything that has happened in the world in the past year, every day life has become disrupted. Manufacturing and supply has been no different. Anyone in technology knows that there is currently a shortage of silicon. This is making computer parts, such as motherboards, graphics cards, etc. in short supply. We have identified and contacted numerous vendors to help reduce any shortages or lead times we may come across that could prevent fulfillment of Accession.\n\nCODING AND DESIGN: Even with all our experience, there's no way around it; coding and design takes time. This along with our philosophy to make this system as simple to operate as possible and give it an easy-to-understand, familiar look and feel, sometimes makes this process a little slow. We are designing this system for EVERYONE, not just technology fanatics.\n\nACTS OF GOD: Every day can bring new challenges. Fires, natural disasters, emergency situations can all happen in the blink of an eye. We are using two different locations for R&D to prevent any natural disaster from disrupting the development of Accession.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Josh Van Metre\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI have been in the technology business for over 25 years.

You will be \"leveled up\" by gaining this knowledge.\n\nRegardless if you are a beginner with Python or a seasoned programming rock-star, Michael Driscoll will help you continue to grow in your developer journey. There are hundreds of awesome tutorials on his blog, Mouse Vs Python, that you can read for free! \n\nImage Processing with Python uses the Pillow package. Pillow is a fork of the Python Imaging Library. Pillow originally released in 2010 and has been stable for many years. It is a well known and trusted imaging library for Python. \n\nYou can rest assured that Michael knows Python. He has been programming and writing about it for over a decade. Michael also has EIGHT other Python books.\n\nYou can get a free sample of the book using this link. This contains a PDF version of the first 3 chapters.\n\nPillow: Image Processing with Python will be published in April 2021\n\nIf you miss the campaign, the book can also be purchased on Leanpub: https://leanpub.com/pillow/\n\nThis book will be printed in COLOR.

If you told people from the Middle Ages or Ancient Egypt about a telephone, a car, or electricity, they would take you for a deity or a superhero. But do you actually know how these things work?\nAs a child, before bed, I used to imagine with my dad what things like bowstrings would be made of in ancient times. In the morning, looking it up, we would be startled to discover that bowstrings were made of veins and if you wanted instead to make one from gunpowder ingredients you had to urinate on hay!\n\nAs I got older, I got into mechanics and discovered that many apparently simple things are based on brilliant ideas. All the discoveries and inventions that seemed incredible and almost magical when I was a child actually were just as fantastical as I imagined!\n\nI realized that most people knew very little about how such inventions of our civilization as a plow, a mill, a blast furnace or glass are made and how they work. I began making a list of the most amazing inventions I would like to tell my children about. Later I added illustrations, which became more and more bizarre and mysterious. After some time, I finished a draft of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries. \n\nNow I want to share this book with everyone who hasn\u2019t lost their juvenile curiosity and love for mystery. If you are as fascinated by technical, military, medical and artistic inventions as I am, you definitely will love The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries and The Ultimate Guide to Rebuilding a Civilization. This book is an illustrated encyclopedia of mechanisms, processes and materials that have played a significant role in human history.\nThere is no other book like this. Currently, information about inventions is scattered here and there in boring textbooks and manuals that are neither understandable nor inspiring. The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries presents the most meaningful facts about our culture combined with out-of-this-world ideas and fabulous illustrations. It is the first treatise of its kind on these spectacular magical inventions. Only with your help will we  be able to create this exceptional book.\nVsevolod  Co-founder of The Book\n\nThe Book is a unique artifact similar to the most mysterious and mantic books of humankind. The visual symbolism of the book connects it to the prominent fifteen-century Voynich manuscript while its uncommon and original ideas are similar to the Summa Technologiae of Stanis\u0142aw Lem. The book is also influenced by the aesthetics of the renowned Codex Seraphinianus. The Ultimate Guide is a real masterpiece and an endless source of inspiration.\n\nOn the pages of The Ultimate Guide you will find visual instructions for making handy mechanisms and materials in case you lose them or forget. With over 400 pages of detailed and catchy illustrations, you will forget about everything and bury yourself in the book. You won\u2019t stop thinking of what you saw.\nThis section is all about how to be healthy, cheerful, and fresh. Here you\u2019ll find out how to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation without getting punched in the nose. You\u2019ll learn how to remove your appendix if you don\u2019t need it anymore. We\u2019ll tell you which mushrooms are tasty and which mushrooms are fun (what are mushrooms and what are shrooms). We\u2019ll teach you yoga and Chinese needle therapy. Believe us, all of this knowledge will come in handy in the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world! (not to mention in the modern world, given the cost of medical insurance). We\u2019ll also explain how to make gypsum, glue, penicillin or even all three together from scratch.\nThe whole world is a big chemistry lab and the only limit here is your lack of knowledge. If there\u2019s sand under your feet, you can make glass. If you see trees around you, it\u2019s a step from there to making paper. The magic of our civilization, which is electricity, can also be made from easily accessible materials. There are tons of ways to make it and we\u2019ll reveal the most original one.\nResearchers have concluded that human brain development was always influenced by laziness and greed. We want to have as much as possible with minimal effort and that\u2019s what makes us geniuses. Mills and water pumps will do the work for you. The combustion engine will help you in traveling any distance. Cameras made of boxes and paper with photosensitive surfaces will immortalize your successes\nIn all the worlds of the Multiverse in which this book will be published, we\u2019ve agreed that killing people isn\u2019t cool. We wish these inventions never appeared, but still\u2026.The trebuchet is pretty darn good. To create saltpeter, which is the main gunpowder component, all it takes is hay and human urine. How long will you have to pee in the pit full of hay? You\u2019ll find this out in The Ultimate Guide. By the way, did you know that the alchemist who discovered gunpowder thought he was creating the elixir of life? Well, if you throw pots full of gunpowder at your enemies, you\u2019ll become immortal (for a while).\nThe home of ancient man began from fire, so if you don\u2019t want to be dumber than your ancestors you need to learn how to use flint and steel. If all goes smoothly, you\u2019ll be able to build a log house, weave a rug, mould houseware out of clay and build a boat. You\u2019ll learn the art of tying knots and using natural dyes. But above all, you\u2019ll learn how to construct a unique top-class mousetrap, so rodents won\u2019t have any chance. (Failing to do that, read about cat domestication in the Farming section.)\n\nIt\u2019s said that wheat domesticated humans rather than the opposite. Agriculture made us who we are today, so in this book you\u2019ll find a detailed description of grain types and animal farming principles. You\u2019ll learn to make fishing nets, help to deliver calves, procure salt and honey. But first you should learn to brew the best-ever wheat beer. (Which will literally be the best beer in the world since you\u2019ll be the only brewer after the fall of civilization)\nLife is not only about surviving; it\u2019s also about not dying of boredom. There will be fewer fights in your survivor camp if you give people cards and chess. Your children won\u2019t set fire to your house (built thanks to the instructions of the Hearth and Home section) because they will be playing ball or flying a kite. You\u2019ll become a local movie mogul if you make a phenakistiscope, a device that creates the illusion of motion. By the way! We\u2019ll tell you how to make a vibrator.\n\n\nThere is nothing similar to the sound of the Australian didg. It\u2019s literally the voice of spirits. This musical instrument exists in all the worlds of the Multiverse, so make sure to read a manual on how to make it. The same applies to the jaw harp, which can be found in the history of any nation on the earth and beyond. During your interworld journey a sitar and a bell will come in handy too. Tell whomever you meet about the music theory of our world and don\u2019t forget to ask about their notation too. \n\nRituals, traditions, and etiquette are as significant as mechanisms and materials. The most basic and peculiar inventions of human communication were collected in The Ultimate Guide. How do you tie a tie to make a good impression? What is the philosophy behind fashion? What are the rules of setting a table and marking the road? How exactly do you carry out seppuku in the way that will most impress others?\nA Dutch philosopher Johan Huizinga in his book Homo Ludens proved that games appeared long before culture. People enjoyed games and invented a gillion of different games in the ensuing thousand years. Many games also keep arcane knowledge. For example, card suits depict archetypes of the human psyche, chessmen talk about the social organization and hierarchy. You\u2019ll be able to rule the whole world if you know how the main games of humanity, such as football or Monopoly, work and what rules they have.\n\nPeople had not yet invented writing when they discovered that fried meat was much better than raw and that fermented fruit juice dissipated sorrow and made them sleep like a baby. Over time, cooking has become a real art that requires imagination and ingenuity. Asians held raw fish in a pressing machine for weeks to make sushi. Arab nomads occasionally discovered cheese recipe by keeping milk in bags made of sheep\u2019s stomachs. And don\u2019t forget to learn the recipe of the main food invention, which is bread. Without bread you won\u2019t be able to make your new world fully civilized. \nThe intriguing illustrations that combine engineering drawings and medieval art depict the structure of devices and materials in many forms throughout the many worlds of the Multiverse. What does it mean? According to The Ultimate Guide, people find new ideas in the world\u2019s information realm rather than come up with new ones. This means that development of these ideas isn\u2019t connected to anything really. They can appear out of the blue in different worlds of the Multiverse.\nIn one of these worlds, medieval peasants work fields with tills attached to bicycles. In another world, gladiators of the Colosseum fight under stadium lights. There is a world where indium-gallium alloys are the essence of microelectronics instead of silicon. In one more world zeppelin became the main means of transport when humanity discovered a cheap way to produce helium as opposed to explosive hydrogen. On the pages of The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries you\u2019ll find tons of such examples and probably will think that similar ideas have come to your mind before.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizons of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.\nThis book will make an excellent gift for all those who are keen on art, technology, history and such puzzling sciences as semiotics and hermeneutics.\nIt is made for satisfying curiosity, widening the horizones of your mind, drawing inspiration and teleporting from world to world.

All the pages of the book will be printed on special thick 157gsm paper. This is a high-quality mat art paper, which definitely feels well and holds well. The Ultimate Guide will be a hardcover book and will have stunning matt laminated cover.\nThe Ultimate Guide contains knowledge of humankind and it can\u2019t come to life without the help of people. We need the support of enthusiasts who believe in the unique future of the human mind.\n                                                   In the first place, the raised money will go to the illustrators because The Book of Incredible Inventions and Discoveries forms a collection of great detailed pictures. The budget also includes the work of content editors and the book\u2019s printing.\nPLAY\n\nThe Book project is promoted by REPROJECT.\n\n\nFB agencies:\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The first and most important thing was to assemble the team of professionals. We spent some time looking for illustrators whose drawing style would be convenient and could match with others\u2019 styles. It was a big deal to find writers for this project as soon as our expectations were rather high and we had a huge number of unsuccessful attempts before we could find writers who can perfectly complement their texts with the illustrations. We also searched out for many researches who support both our writers and illustrators with all the needed technical information. We managed to find experts in scientific, medical, technical and social fields who constantly advise us on what information the book should include to provide readers precise and workable instructions. All in all, we have 36 people in our team, about 10 side experts and this number is constantly growing. After that came the second step of our work which unfortunately took more time and turned out to be more complicated than we expected. We all had to get used to each other to stabilize and optimize the working process. The problem on the technical side was that we\u2019re an international team of nearly 40 people living in different countries all over the world. Time lag challenged our determination and commitment to work together on this amazing project. Finally, we won this fight but there were many others yet to come. Sometimes it was a hard time for us to learn to hear each other, we could meet every day and argue about many small and insignificant thing for hours. We still meet every day but now we can proudly say that our meetings are more productive than ever before. At last, making process is synchronized and we\u2019re actively working on the book.

To bring this concept to life we\u2019re working hardly and experimenting on both levels of the book \u2013 illustrations and texts.\n\nWe think that the best way to describe our way of working process is to say that we use cut-and-try approach.

It is impossible to spot any pixel on the screen that is projected.\" --Tyriel Wood\nMade by Unbox Fantasy, a professional crew assemblage from the former editors of tech review media. \nStill tethered to the past with an old bulky head-mounted display (HDM) or backpack-sized HD monitor weighing on your mood while working or watching entertainment? You may be feeling dizzy due to the visual \u2018melee attack\u2019 of first-gen displays or bothered by curious prying eyes when watching videos in public, or feeling self-conscious like a time-traveler with a bizarre gadget strapped to your head while trying to relax with some multimedia?\nGet GodView and set yourself free from old technology for an incredibly immersive visual experience for fun and productivity. Whether you are a hardcore gamer, movie fanatic, or busy commuter looking for an entertainment solution, GodView is a revolutionary solution that delivers an extradimensional experience for multimedia. A next-gen wearable with a perfectly balanced super lightweight, affordable, and stylish design suitable for everyday use.\nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\n\nGodView is designed as a standard-setting smart device, to bring user & budget-friendly mixed reality to life. Any content on your mobile phone can be cast wirelessly to the 300-inch virtual display in front of you.  It unveils vivid imagery before your eyes, empowering you with superb vision even more lifelike than what your eyes can show you.  \nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\nHigh Resolution\nGodView serves as a match for a professional monitor with a resolution of 2*2560*2560 (5K) that is sharp enough to eliminate ghosting, graininess, or optical grating, which allows you to experience visual details you can\u2019t see with typical displays.\n 3650 PPI See-Through Demo:\n Large Display Size & FOV \nGodView creates a massive 300\u2019\u2019 virtual display with a binocular 110-degree wide field of view (FOV) that naturally merges virtual details into the real-world viewed through the lens, for an incredibly immersive experience.\nNB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)\n High Refresh Rate & Brightness\n  GodView supports a 90Hz refresh rate so the images you see are always extremely smooth without visible flickering, and with a brightness up to 2000 nits, the display is ultra-clear even in bright daylight.\nMyopia Adaptability\nIf you wear glasses, it\u2019s time to put them aside! GodView can self-tune its clarity for myopia of -8~0D, which means near-sighted users can see clearly and comfortably without wearing their everyday glasses or contacts. (Offered as an optional function in addition to the standard model). By continuously controlling the change of focal length, the eye can be trained to achieve the purpose of adjusting myopia. Holographic optics change and adjust the focal length automatically according to an advanced algorithm.\nNB.

Without the distraction of cords or a bulky headset, you can indulge yourself completely with \u2018God\u2019s view\u2019 and enjoy the best visuals.\n\n  Why Super Waveguide \nGodView utilizes the super waveguide optical solution made of lightweight resin. This innovation transforms the conventional head-mounted display into an everyday fashion item weighing just 55g, less than 1/10 of Microsoft HoloLens\n Wi-Fi Connectivity \nGodView achieves its unique lightweight performance without a heavy battery or processor onboard. It uses a compact Wi-Fi 6 bridge housing a power supply that can work continuously for over 4 hours and any multimedia on your smartphone can be cast wirelessly to the GodView virtual display in front of your eyes.

The Kolude Hub version is designed with an all-in-one docking function that lets you read and transfer data, and charge your keyboard or other devices, all at an extremely fast rate\u2014doing what no other keyboard could do. \nIf you\u2019re a busy traveler who needs a spectacular keyboard to go with you wherever adventure, work or business takes you, we have a special Bluetooth version of the Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard. Along with being extremely compact and portable, the Bluetooth version offers you a truly wireless experience. The built-in 850 mAh lithium battery provides you 10 hours of continuous working time with a backlight and 650 hours without a backlight. In short, with the Bluetooth version, the Kolude KD-K2 allows you to get everything done and going wherever you are, wherever you go!\n\nIf you\u2019re happy with your Mac or iPad, you\u2019ll be thrilled to have an extremely advanced multifunctional keyboard hub that lets you do more\u2014whether it\u2019s work or play\u2014with your Apple Devices. We\u2019re introducing the Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard, designed to let you extract even more value from your Apple devices, having far more gaming fun or working efficiency with a keyboard hub like no other. \nA superb feature of the keyboard that deserves a highlight is the Full Functional Host, a USB 3.1 type-C uplink interface that not only supports iPad 11\u201d/\u201d12.9 and MacBooks with USB-C generations, but also other non-Apple devices, such as Surface Pro7 and other laptops and tablets with a USB-C interface. \nThe Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard is equipped with Hotkey functions that are compatible with iPad OS and Mac OS. At the same time, we\u2019ve added more optimization functionalities for Windows to achieve higher compatibility, and a switching play between Mac and Windows just by pressing several keys combined. \nThe Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard is made from premium aluminum. That makes it an extremely stylish keyboard that\u2019s also robust and made to last. At the same time, the aluminum structure prevents the device from overheating and from feeling too hot when you use it, and it keeps it extremely lightweight and easy to carry.\n\nAn impressive design that kills your productivity doesn\u2019t impress us at all. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built the Kolude KD-K2 Aluminum Keyboard with round groove buttons with scissor-switch keys. This ensures that you have highly reliable, responsive and quiet keys with short travel times that perform wonderfully when it comes to typing. After all, what\u2019s a keyboard good for if not for typing, right?\n\nNow this is a matter of personal preference, which is why we created three options. You can have your Kolude KD-K2 in silvery, gray, black version. Either way, this is the ultimate keyboard that you\u2019ll definitely enjoy working or playing with!\nThis is not our first Kickstarter campaign. In fact, in March 2020, we completed a successful Kickstarter for the Kolude KD-K1, the previous version of the now launched keyboard. We raised a total of USD $172,000, over 1,000% of our funding goal, and we diligently fulfilled our rewards to our backers. That tells you that we have the experience, technical knowledge and background to create a new Kickstarter success story for the Kolude KD-K2 Keyboard, which can now be yours!\nKolude was founded in Shenzhen, China, where our own established factory with more than 100 professionals who work every day on every stage to get our products excellently manufactured. We also have a team of highly experienced designers who focus on designing and creating state-of-the-art electronic and non-electronic accessories, such as Kolude KD-K2, which we\u2019re now presenting to you.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike all Kickstarter projects, we will face certain risks and challenges in delivering this product at the quality we demand of ourselves.

We love Black and many backers have asked for Black for our previous project because Black color is more stain-resistant in the long run. White color chargers are for illustrative purposes and may be offered later at retail after fulfillment for Kickstarter is completed. Please understand that having multiple color choices, especially for different chargers within the same reward will just complicate and delay the entire Kickstarter fulfillment process. For example, we won't be able to ask for your color choices until after the project ends via a survey which means we cannot accurately prepare the rewards beforehand.\nEarly Bird Special (50% off)\n$39    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$49    -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$88    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nKickstarter Special (40% off)\n$48     -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$59     -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$108   -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nExpected Retail Price\n$79.99     -   1 x HyperJuice 65W\n$99.99     -   1 x HyperJuice 100W\n$179.98    -   1 x HyperJuice 65W + 1 x HyperJuice 100W\nReward Fulfilment\nTo ensure timely reward delivery, we will ship rewards via insured postal service from our fulfillment and distribution centers in:\nCalifornia USA - fulfilling rewards within the United States\nProject Timeline\nSeptember 28, 2020 - Kickstarter begins\nOctober 26, 2020 - Kickstarter ends\nNovember 2020 - Production begins\nDecember 2020 - Shipping of Early Bird rewards\nJanuary 2021 - Shipping of Kickstarter rewards\nFrom the team that brought you the World's First 100W USB-C battery pack and Kickstarter Most Funded power bank project\n(as well as the world's 1st, smallest, and most crowdfunded 100W GaN charger)\nAbout Us\nHYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making award-winning USB-C products since 2015. We also have a long proven track record of delivering Kickstarter and Indiegogo projects. Our most successful Kickstarter and Indiegogo project, HyperDrive USB-C Hub for MacBook Pro, raised over $3.1 million and is currently the most crowdfunded MacBook and USB-C accessory. Our latest Kickstarter and Indiegogo, HyperJuice 100W GaN Charger, which raised over $3.3 million is the most crowdfunded USB-C charger. The HyperJuice 130W USB-C Battery Pack is the most crowdfunded power bank project on Kickstarter ($1.4M). Our HyperDrive USB-C Hub for iPad Pro is the most crowdfunded iPad accessory ($1.2M) and many more. So we do have a lot of experience with USB-C and Apple products. This is our 26th crowdfunding project. Our previous crowdfunding projects have altogether raised over $14 million and we have delivered to over 140,000 backers.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nBig thanks to Team MVP for producing our awesome video and product photos.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is without risk and challenges but we try to do our absolute best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to coming to Kickstarter. We are also no strangers to portable power, USB-C, mobile accessories or crowdfunding.\n\nThe HyperJuice charger that you see in the above video/photos are actual full working prototypes.\n\nWith your support, we can bring HyperJuice to users everywhere. We have started mass production and your contribution will help us achieve economies of scale and keep the product cost low.\n\nWe have sufficient materials to manufacture about 5,000 units now. Beyond that, the lead time is about a month. Your strong support will give us the needed affirmation to place a larger raw materials order and start mass production earlier.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "1 x HyperJuice 65W (KS Special)", "descp": "Get one (1) HyperJuice 65W, at 40% off the expected retail price of $79.99!

It establishes the standard for future USB power strips by providing higher speed charges for all your appliances including laptops while eliminating the need for adapters.\nFunctionality doesn\u2019t have to come at a cost of good design. Adopting a tradition-defying look, sleek outline and fireproof glossy coating, PowerCloud transcends into a sophisticated desktop powerhouse to keep a complete workstation and entertainment center fully powered and charged.\nIt is a must-have essential for working from home. If you are busy working to a tight schedule at home in the presence of your family, Powercloud automatically keeps all the cords and devices organized so well and makes clutters and messes disappear for good.\n\nPowerCloud is a power strip equipped with 3 AC outlets, 2 USB-C Power Delivery (PD) ports and 1 USB-A Quick Charge (QC) port.\nIn addition to providing a large amount of power for electrical devices such as computers, TVs, printers and lighting, it also offers blazing-fast, adapter-free, cable-only USB charges to phones, tablets, and laptops.\n\nLeading the way is the 65W of USB-C power - the highest of all on the market - able to give your 13\u201d MackBook Pro or MacBook Air a full-speed charge without the need for additional usb power bricks.\nIf you commute daily between your residence and workplace, you can have one PowerCloud at home and one in the office, then you can say goodbye to those heavy, bulky adapters without worrying about your devices running out of power.\nIf you travel a lot, you just need to bring one PowerCloud which fits perfectly in your backpack instead of lugging around several big power adapters to have all of your devices powered up or charged up at maximum speed.\nPowerCloud not only supports PD3.0 fast charge tech through its dual USB-C ports but also QC3.0 through the USB-A port rated at 18W, able to charge compatible devices up to 4 times faster than a conventional USB power strip. For instance, you can charge your smartphone up to 80% in just 30 minutes.\nPowerCloud can quickly charge everything you throw at it. In addition to smartphones, tablets and laptops, it also works with Nintendo switch, Kindle, power banks, keyboard, headphones, smart watches, table fan and light.\n\nPowerCloud packs three AC outlets in its compact footprint which are widely spaced to accommodate even oversized plugs and power adapters without overlapping.\nThe contact points inside the socket are made with absolute precision at a level of 0.1mm and subjected to rigorous tests to ensure secure grips after thousands of times of use. It won\u2019t become loose or wear out over time to cause heat or sparks, nor too tight to budge the prongs.\nPowerCloud puts the safety of you and your expensive electronics above all else by employing an all-around 10-fold protection. It offers safeguards against overheat, overcurrent, overvoltage, overcharge, short circuit, overload, undervoltage and electrical shock, fried components, pokes of fingers or other objects. It also comes with a fire-resistant casing of the highest fireproof standard in the industry.\nDon't work with an office or live with a home tied down by messy wires and tangles of electric cords. Powercloud helps keep your space clutter-free and your mind stress-free for maximum productivity and creativity. The ports on the PowerCloud are strategically arranged in two separate zones: the top zone dedicated to AC outlets and the front zone dedicated to DC usb outputs. The power cables on the front can be routed to the back and hidden from sight. The USB cables on the front are easy to access and quick to plug/unplug. So they won\u2019t end up unruly and bundled up together. And the separation of high- and low-voltage ports eliminates the risk of electric shock and fire hazards.\nPowerCloud is the best 6-port charging station for multiple devices. It connects up to 6 devices simultaneously, meeting the diverse power needs for work and play of the whole family.\n\n\nCombined with smart IC, PowerCloud automatically detects and adjusts the power for connected devices accordingly and ensures rapid, optimal charging while greatly extending the lifespan of the batteries.\n\nPowerCloud packs 65W of USB power, which can either be distributed throughout the three ports or dedicated solely to the USB-C port with a minimum of 45W output even when all the ports are plugged in, giving your laptop or tablet a good amount of juice.\nPowerCloud sports a minimalist design which will blend in nicely sitting next to your iMac, MacBook or iPhone. It is a departure from blocky, tedious power strips that are meant to hide under desks and behind furniture. You can leave it in plain sight on a desk or table top as a decor which adds functional style to a workspace at home or in the office.\n\nThere is a LED light which will illuminate green when your devices are being charged, and a master switch to turn on and off all power.\nSince 2008, Torras has been a brand that never settles for mediocrity and is full of aspirations and dreams.

On each Omen card it outlines how many Room Tiles, How Many Enemies Start, and Boss health cards at the start of the game. \nPlayers will use these tiles to construct the map. There are 4 types of tiles: Enemy Spawn Tiles, Player Spawn Tiles, Regular Tiles, and The VAULT. Players will start by placing The Vault tile, then regular Tiles ending with spawn tiles.  \nOnce all the regular tiles are placed, Players can now choose where to place their spawn tiles and the enemy spawn tiles. \nEach character also has a unique set of actions, such as how far they can move and how many tokens they can use.\nPlayers will have to use their abilities and their tokens to scare enemies away from the Scare Factory. Eventually, you will have to fight off the boss that is leading the attack. Work together and combine your abilities in order to stop the humans from commercializing fear itself! If you want to know more or see the game in action, take a look at the videos on our page. Start defending The Scare Factory from those pesky humans and capitalists! \nSpeaking of which, the enemies in Scare Factory get a turn all to themselves. They each spawn on a unique enemy tile at the start of the game. They roll a dice which dictates where they go. Sometimes, if you\u2019re lucky, you can choose where they go. Most of the time they will search the factory for you, so you have to be careful!\nWhen an enemy is fooled into stepping on a scare token, they will be scared. Players then roll to see which direction they go. Again, like regular enemy movement, there is a chance that players can control where the enemies go. Sometimes the enemy will flee the board immediately. We will discuss that in a moment. If you land on another scare token, this starts a scare chain! After three scares, an enemy flees, removing them from the board. One of the most important parts of the game is these scare chains. \nAnother big aspect of enemy interaction is Ward Tokens. If an enemy walks into a ward token, players become able to move said enemy wherever they choose. As you may be able to tell, this is very helpful in completing a scare chain.\nThe Boss is a very powerful force to be reckoned with, so it\u2019s best to be on your toes. The boss will not be active at the start, letting minions do the dirty work, but inevitably they will come to deal with meddling interlopers (like you) themselves! Bosses have a set of ability cards that give them and the other enemies new powers. There are 32 total, but only 5 are active at a time.  \nThese abilities serve another important purpose: they act as the bosses' life. With each scare you pull off while the boss is active, you can remove an ability from the pile. Once this is done, the ability underneath is revealed and becomes active during the boss phase. Keep fighting through and remove all the cards in order to win! Hopefully, this has given you a bit more insight into the threat you are fighting against! Good luck in your fight to free the Scare Factory!\nDo you want to Test Play 'The Scare Factory' ? If so sign-up to get access to a tabletop simulator version. SIGN UP\nThe game is 100% playable without stretch goals, but we feel these are great incentives to provide to our backers for helping us fund 'The Scare Factory'. Also all stretch goals will be considered KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!!!!   \nMORE TO COME!!!!\n Being a first-time creator on Kickstarter we knew miniature production is a huge aspect of having an immersive player experience. I wanted to share a bit of our story about how we developed our miniatures.\nInitially, we wanted amazing characters in the game, but we also wanted them to look great. Our first step was to concept everything in 2d. From the concepts, we went into 3d development with our Talented art team.  The 3d development was combined with many iterations from the Design team on how the characters should look and feel. Lastly, we purchased 2 3d resin printers to test each 3d model. After each character was 3d printed we made adjustments to height, the scale of objects, details, etc. Just so everyone is aware we did 3d print every single character a minimum of 3-5 times to make sure iterations improved. The Video below showcases the full process of the Man-O-War expansion Boss!!!\n\n As explained earlier we adjusted our character heights via iterations and came up with our own scale that we thought was a great fit. Our heights range between 33mm (humans) and 60mm (Players and Bosses) \nWe really wanted to show off our amazing miniatures and decided to partner with a couple of painters. We reached out to Circle of Nerds and he offered an amazing paint demo (showcased below). We will also be doing a live painting demo with Life of a Board Gamer on October 20,2020 for everyone to check out. \n Some More Showcases \n Social Media\nWe have been doing quite a few posts on Instagram to show real pictures of the game and also have some youtube videos showing testing, art dev, and much more. Here are some links to check out our social media\nInstagram\nYouTube\nBGG \nShipping Details: All shipping prices are estimated in USD and are subject to change. We will also be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics to help with customs and tax friendly shipping. We will also be doing free local pickup for anyone located in The Greater Toronto or Kitchener/Waterloo Area. \nSupAR Games originally created in 2018. We focused our development on Augmented Reality technologies while doing some work for hire projects. We took our years of video game development and poured our efforts into 'The Scare Factory'. We brought on an art team, design team, and multiple testers. Together we have spent over 5000 hours to bring you 'The Scare Factory'\n Special Thanks to the people below to help us showcase 'The Scare Factory'\nLance Hinkel from Learn 2 Play for Learn to Play Video and Overview \nMark Streed from Dice Tower for the Preview \nOMG Nexus for Interview and an Overview \nLouie Martinez from Circle of Nerds for his Miniature painting demo\nDanijel Ljubas from Life of a Board Gamer for his painting livestream on October 20\nStephanie Cassandra from Minimum Player Count for a great video (coming soon)\nBoth Sides of My Table for an awesome written preview\nand the friends and family that help support the development of The Scare Factory\n Our timeline has been carefully planned. With the majority of art already created we will only need some touchups for production and template focused. We have already reached out to multiple manufacturers and they are prepared to take on our project. There is always a chance of delay, but we will make sure to let the backers know about any delays in production. \n Pledge Manager will be Backerkit ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nScare Factory is the first tabletop game that SupAR Games has worked on. Thanks to our experienced staff we have done our best to avoid the classic pitfalls that many first time projects fall into, but we still feel that it\u2019s important for you to know. We have assembled a team with a wide variety of skills to ensure that we are able to not only create the best content we can, but also to get different voices to help keep our goals realistic and our vision achievable. The main game art has mostly been completed already. The only new art that would be needed is for stretch goals and updating for printing components. That will allow us to get into production quite fast. \n\nWe are working hard to ensure that production will go smoothly, but as you may expect, it is possible that there may be COVID-19 related delays.

I have found that while learning how the various widgets work in wxPython is valuable, it is even better to learn by creating a simple application that does something useful.\nThe code in this book will be targeted for Python 3 only using wxPython 4.\nNote: If you missed the campaign, you can still get the book over on Leanpub. It will also be available on Amazon, Gumroad and other retailers in May 2018.\nCreating GUI Applications with wxPython\nThe code in this book will run on all 3 major platforms:\nWindows \nMac \nLinux\nIn this book, we will be creating the following applications:\nA simple image viewer \nA database viewer \nA database editor \nCalculator\nAn archiving application (zip / tar) \nPDF merging application \nXML Editor \nWe will also learn how to turn your applications into executables for Windows.\nAs you learn how to create these applications, you will also learn how wxPython works. We will go over how wxPython's event system works, how to use threads in wxPython, make use of sizers and much, much more!\nStretch Goal #1: $5500 (COMPLETE)\nAdd chapters on the following topics:\nMP3 Tag Editor\nNASA image downloader / search tool\nStretch Goal #2: $8000\nAdd new chapters that cover\nFile search utility ($6500)\nSimple FTP application ($7250) \nGraph creator (or TBA) ($8000)\nRelease Date\nI expect to have this book finished by May 2019\nWriting Style \nThis book will be written using my original conversational style. What this means is that the chapters will probably vary in size more than most programming books. \nI still follow the rule of giving simple examples paired with simple explanations instead of spending an inordinate amount of time re-explaining the same subject over and over.\nIf you've never read anything of mine before, you can download Python 101 for free or read it online. You can also check out my blog for writing examples.\nWho should read this book? \nThis book is for someone who already uses Python and would like to learn how to use Python to create fun cross-platform graphical user interfaces.\nWhat's the money for?\nISBNs cost money, especially if you have multiple formats of the book (paperback, PDF, mobi, etc). The money will also cover the initial print run of the book for the backers. It will also cover copyright registration and the cost of my illustrator. It would be great if I could do some web advertising as well. \nI'm looking forward to working with my backers to make the best Python book possible!\nAbout the Author\nI'm a professional full time Python programmer by day and Python blogger by night. I've been programming almost exclusively in Python for almost 10 years. I co-authored Core Python for DZone.

Places for good.\nSadly, we found ourselves more and more disappointed and frustrated about what existing ones are turning out to be: giant monetisation platforms with very little care and interest for their best asset: people.\n\nWe could probably write a book about everything wrong going on, but chances are if you have an internet or tv connection you have seen it in the news lately. \nSo instead, we'll focus on what makes Openbook different than any other social network.\n\ud83d\udd4a Honesty\nClaiming that you do something is not enough. People should be able to prove it. That's why all of the code for Openbook will be open-source.\nThis means anyone will be able to check on what we are exactly doing and hold us accountable for it.\n\nGoodbye closed walls!\n\ud83d\ude48 Privacy-friendly\nThis was our initial drive to build Openbook.\nWe wanted to create a social network where we could chat and share things with our friends and family with the confidence that our privacy was respected and protected.\n\nOpenbook will have zero tolerance for the tracking and monitoring of people.\nSurf the network with absolute peace of mind! \ud83c\udfd6\n\ud83d\udcb8 A revenue model that supports content creators!\nLet's get it out of the way: Our revenue model is not nor ever will be advertisement. \nInstead, it will be based on a digital currency called Tip \ud83c\udff5.\n\nThis currency will be used for a lot of things. Our priority though?\nSupporting content creators.\n\nThe internet is nothing without content creators and we are committed to finding ways for them to not just make a living but also have a stable income and make profit.\nYou will be able to Tip them at any given moment, but even better, become their angel and commit to donating certain amount of money to them on a flexible or fixed manner.\nIn exchange, they will be able to create exclusive content for you which you will receive directly in your feed.\nThis is just one example of the things possible with Tips \ud83c\udff5 ! Read more here\n\ud83d\ude9a Got another social network? Bring it all with you!\nDue to recent advancements in data-portability pushed by the European Union, if you already have a social network you will be able to import your photos, videos, chats and more into Openbook from existing major social networks!\nMoving away to another social network has never been easier.\nFull disclosure: There's a lot of room to improve on how existing social networks do data portability.\n\ud83d\udd12 Secure by design\nFrom day one, we will take malicious practices for granted and take care to minimise or eliminate their impact.\nDue to the open-source (see Honest point) nature of our code, we will also do our best to encourage info-sec professionals/enthusiasts to hunt for vulnerabilities. \nWhile initially we won't be able to afford fancy rewards or large bounties, if we succeed, we won't be shy about them. \n\nWe acknowledge the worth of finding a security vulnerability goes beyond a free t-shirt.\n\ud83d\udc77 A diverse & experienced team\nOur team consists of globally recognised information-security experts, talented software engineers, hackers, seasoned designers, human rights advocates & award winning privacy activists.\nWe recognise the challenges of building Openbook but most importantly, we are ready to take on them.\n\ud83d\udc83 Fun & social!\nBuilding a secure version of an existing social network will never be enough to compete with existing social networks. If we want to succeed we must build something unique, something better.\nAnd for this we're looking into build a social network that is actually fun to use and most importantly... wait for it... social *ba dum tss* \ud83e\udd41.\nWe have a lot of ideas. For example, a fun and secure way to chat with anyone around the world using animated avatars, new types of content and... oh wait, right, we're not supposed to share these kind of ideas just yet. \n\nYou get the idea, we want to dare to innovate, to break the status quo social networks have been in for the past years.\nEven better? We're open for all ideas! We'll create a place where you will be able to submit your idea, vote on other people's ideas and ultimately see it become a reality!\nTalk about doing things together.\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udfa8 Customisable!\nSocial networks are all about who we are. Our friends, our family, our memories, our conversations. Nowadays we're all confined to the same silly template and colours of the corporation hosting us. \nWe want to change this. We want to make Openbook personal, for it to feel like home, like an extension of yourself.\nThat's why we'll be making every single piece of Openbook customisable.\n\nP.S. Yes, even our logo.\n\ud83c\udf0e And last but most importantly, a project for good.\nTech companies have a huge potential for doing good outside the digital realm.\nWe want Openbook to be beneficial for everyone, not just to the country that hosts us. That's why, if we succeed, we'll be putting 30% of our profits straight into making the world a better place for everyone, forever.\n\nWe're doing this in partnership with FoundersPledge, a non-profit that makes sure every single cent given makes a factual difference.\n\nEducation, cash transfers to those in most need, sanitisation, nutrition and disease prevention to name a few of the causes we will be supporting.\n\ud83c\udfc1 The Kickstarter goal \ud83c\udfc1\nFull-disclosure: This campaign is a re-launch. In our previous campaign we set our goal for 100k and made it to 45k. We reduced our minimum viable product, pitched in some of our personal savings and decided to direct every single cent towards getting us through 6 months of full-time software development. No extra-hands, no dedicated team workspace and definitely not enough servers to handle any significant load, but\u2026 If we succeed at building a great first version, we go from there.\n\ud83d\udcf130,000\u20ac | Openbook mobile version!

We have \"flexible\" offices, also known as cafes and our own apartments.\nWhere are you based?\nWe are based in The Netherlands, Europe! \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\nWhats with the funny job titles?\nWell, if we put things like CEO, CISO, COO and else, people immediately assume we're a settled company that will be just fine without backing. \nWill it be decentralised?\nInitially it will be built on a centralised manner. This will allow us to focus in innovating in regards to the user experience and functionality product rather than coming up with a brand new behind the scenes technology.\nIn the future, we\u2019re looking into decentralisation from very specific angles and for different things. Application wise, resiliency and data ownership.\nA project we\u2019re keeping an eye on and that shares some of our vision on this is Tim Berners Lee\u2019s MIT Solid project. It\u2019s all about decoupling applications from the data they use.\nIf the digital currency is such an important part of Openbook, why are you not offering it as a reward?\nOffering any kind of money equivalent goes against Kickstarters rewards rules.\nDid you re-launch your campaign?\nYes we did. You can read more about this here.\nThe open-book.org domain is annoying! Remove the dash NOW!\nThis annoys us too. Sadly, we don't have enough funds to purchase the openbook.com domain. If we get funded, this will be something will be doing and all of the annoyances will be gone! So please, help us get a proper domain!\nIf I donate and you don't meet your goal, do I get my money back?\nYep! And In fact, the money only leaves your account AFTER the kickstarter campaign ends.\nMeaning no goal reached = no money charged.\nCyber-cyber?\nCyber cyber cyber.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 Openbook Founder Starter Pack!", "descp": "Get early-access to the network, claim your Openbook @username, show off a Founder Badge in your profile and earn a spot in the Openbook's Founder Book! \ud83d\udd7a\nAll of this for 5\u20ac!\nINCLUDES:\nClaim your username\nExclusive Founder Badge in profile\nYour name in the Openbook's Founder Book\nEarly-access", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["934 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac14 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 + \ud83d\udcbb Exclusive Laptop Stickers!", "descp": "The Founder Starter Pack plus 2 exclusive and highest quality laptop stickers! \ud83d\udc4c\nINCLUDES:\nClaim your username\nEarly-access\nExclusive Founder Badge in profile\nYour name in the Openbook's Founder Book\nExclusive Openbook Black Sticker\nExclusive Openbook White Sticker", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["281 backers", "Limited (118 left of 399)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac39 or more", "title": "\ud83d\udce6 + \ud83d\udcbb+ \ud83d\udca7 Sustainable Water Bottle", "descp": "We want to do good for the world.

Engineered to be a 4K media center and desktop replacement in one, Panther Alpha is powered by the latest Panther OS (based on Linux) and Android Marshmallow, bringing you endless of possibilities in an affordable, easy to use, tiny package!\nEquipped with a 2GHz Quad Core Cortex A53 and 2GB of DDR3 Memory, the Panther Alpha outperforms popular developments boards such as the Raspberry Pi 3 and aims to be not only the most polished ARM powered Linux desktop experience yet but also the most complete Linux experience by tying hardware and software together.\nPanther OS is a Linux based operating system designed for Panther Alpha, to help you accomplish more on your computer with less. With Panther OS, you get a familiar, reliable desktop experience that gives you access to your cloud-apps through Google Chromium and thousands of desktops apps such as Libre Office or Gimp (a popular Photoshop alternative) through our application\u2019s store.\nFreedom - Our library of thousands of open source applications are completely FREE. You can download and install them easily and they\u2019re yours to keep forever. No registration. No licensing - for home, business, school.\nSecurity - Backdoor viruses, malware, and other exploits are no match for Panther. A 2014 ESET report indicated there to be as many as 400 times the reported threats on Windows as there are on Linux, making the latter the more secure by quite some distance.\nCompatibility - Panther OS seamlessly integrates the apps you know and expect from Mac and Microsoft alike. Things like Office compatibility, Exchange support and Google Apps are no afterthought. They\u2019re built-in, along with all your other favourite programs.\nCustomization - No two Panthers are the same, and your machine is defined by you, just as it should be. You can easily change backgrounds, colors and fonts - even the entire desktop. The way your Alpha looks is entirely up to you. Whether it\u2019s a Windows-inspired taskbar, or a familiar Mac layout, the Linux Desktop is extremely customizable right out of the gate, so you can make it your own from day one. \nEfficiency - Panther OS uses up to 80% less memory than the average desktop computer. What usually takes around 1,000MB RAM after startup, Panther OS does with just 200MB. Even under full load, Panther rocks 17 times less energy compared to the Mac Mini.\nWe\u2019ve designed Panther Alpha to be a reliable companion, wherever you go. With no moving parts, no fans, all-flash storage, a strong aluminum casing and a power consumption of only 2W to 4W, make the Panther Alpha the most efficient, all-in-one (Linux) desktop computer in the world. All that in a package not much bigger than your wallet.\nLet\u2019s put this in perspective: The average desktop uses between 80-260W and runs Windows and other licensed software from at least Microsoft (Office, Antivirus, Photoshop, ..), costing you hundreds, if not thousands in licensing fees and renewal. Panther Alpha on the other hand uses 2W-4W and runs Panther OS, giving you easy access to thousands of free open source applications that rival paid applications such as Microsoft Office and Photoshop, both in quality and usability.\nPanther Alpha is a trusty companion for everyone, with at least two major Panther OS releases planned for our very first device and security fixes for up to 4 \u00bd years after each Panther OS release. Assuming you\u2019re using the device for 5 years, that\u2019s $17.8 per year or around $1.50 per month - less than a coffee.\nWe\u2019ve taken a look at what our users truly need to stay connected and while Apple has since reduced their latest Macbook Pro to Thunderbolt 3 ports only, with adapters costing up to $40, Panther Alpha still features the real \u2018thing\u2019: Gigabit ethernet, HDMI 2.0, 2 x USB, microSD card reader, S/PDIF and the good, old 3.5mm headphone jack. If you\u2019re going wireless, you can rely on 802.11 Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0 and even IR, for presentations or to control navigate your media from the couch.\nHook-up your Panther Alpha with a gorgeous TV, modern display or beamer and output up to 4K. Your eyes, friends and family will be breathless. Even if you\u2019re laboured with a two-ton 1990s display unit, an $8 HDMI to VGA adapter from any back alley hardware store will turn it into the perfect output for your Panther Alpha.\nAnd if the 32GB on-board flash storage isn\u2019t doing it for you, you can easily expand via microSD, USB hard disk or NAS (Network Attached Storage), even shared from another Panther Alpha, for even more space to store your favourite music, photos, and videos.\nPanther Alpha might not look like what you\u2019d expect of a desktop computer, but looks can be deceiving. Beneath the gorgeous aluminium casing lies a powerful 2GHz quad-core 64 bit ARM Cortex-A53.\nPanther Alpha packs a serious punch. Compared to the much-revered Raspberry Pi 3, it boasts twice the memory and runs around 48% faster. Not to mention that it\u2019s designed with end users in mind. It\u2019s the complete package.\nThe Alpha also enjoys far more connectivity options than the Intel Compute Stick, including GB LAN and 4K video, giving you considerably more bang for your buck.\nIn addition, we strive to make Panther Alpha the perfect piece of equipment, whatever your needs. Whether you plan to develop with, on or for the system, use another OS (Linux, Android, Unix) or turn your Alpha in a server, head over to our community and share your ideas.  \n If you\u2019re still looking for stocking fillers, the Panther Alpha makes the perfect Christmas gift for that special someone. All our Kickstarter backers are eligible to receive their very own free digital gift certificate to give away when the big day arrives. At the end of the current campaign, you\u2019ll be able to let us know which model you\u2019d prefer to receive, and whether you\u2019d like us to send out a Christmas gift certificate.\n$200,000: If we can hit this goal together, we\u2019ll be able to offer an exclusive aluminium black version of the Panther Alpha. You can select your color preference at the end of this campaign.\nIn June 2016, we had the idea to turn the Raspberry Pi 3 into a stable computer platform. Our chief goals were to: \nMake Linux more accessible to the novice user \nEducate people on the benefits of open source, especially in regards to security \nProvide a complete, affordable platform \nMeet the needs of the everyday majority and allow them to take back control \nThe results were a resounding success, and we began handing out units to friends, family, and business associates to take for a test drive. The Raspberry Pi 3 gave us a good idea of what the platform is capable of, but we needed more power and more memory. We were looking to build a device not only for developers, but also the end-users, and now it was much clearer how to achieve that. \nWe continued working on the Pi 3 but maintained the ambition to take it further. We began reaching out to investors and distributors, and soon raised the $12,000 we needed to get started on a platform of our own, and found a manufacturer that could meet the specs we desired. With a few high-quality samples in hand, we hired Aaron Sowry; an Embedded Software Developer with vast ARM and Linux experience. With his help, we were able to initiate the device and begin work on what later became known as \u2018Panther OS\u2019.\nWith your backing, we can continue working on the computing platform of the future and you will get one of the first - your very own, Panther Alpha - in fact, one of the first in history!\nThe initial release of Panther OS will bring a stable platform to first backers, but allows future updates to be dictated by your feedback. We strive to ensure the continued development of Panther OS, with more meaningful updates designed to enhance your experience.\nOur backers will receive a developer kit along with their hardware. With the Panther OS SDK, you\u2019ll get access to the kernel, most of the framework and more to give you the ability to develop, customize and built the future of Linux with us. For example, you can modify the kernel to support your favorite hardware peripherals, and the framework to customize certain features and look and feel of Panther OS.\nWe have pledges designed to specifically support work on the Amlogic S905: \nWayland Support \nMainline Linux Kernel Support \n\u201cEarly Access to Panther OS\u201d backers get access to Panther OS beta builds, driver packages, and build script. They can use our work on drivers related to the S905 on their own devices with this chipset or to port other Linux OS distributions to Panther Alpha - you have completely control.\nWe\u2019re a diverse group of designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs who have spent the last year honing the Panther Alpha into what we believe to be a revolution not only for Linux computing, but the rights of every user in the world today. Here\u2019s the team behind this ambitious plan:\nPanther OS, paired with Panther Alpha is our answer to what\u2019s going on in the world: We're giving the power back to the user, with access to thousands of tested, completely free open source applications that don\u2019t compromise on usability but save you real bucks. Powerful tools such as TOR and a built-in VPN client help protect your privacy online and the sensible, pre-configured Firewall and non-logging DNS shield you from hacking and hijacking. The portable design allows you take Panther Alpha everywhere, to use as your desktop, as a server or hooked-up to the TV, to serve your media.\nWe\u2019ve taken away the headaches Linux can cause by providing a unified platform of hardware and software with integrated updates. Panther OS gives the power to choose what you share back to you: no mandatory sign-ups, secure software, and built-in tools to protect your privacy that are often left inaccessible to novices. We make computing much more efficient, with a highly-optimized OS that serves the majority of users. Your PC simply doesn\u2019t need to be any bigger, nor does it need to be more expensive. The complete Panther platform will set you back no more than $100 with zero ongoing costs and even significant reductions to your energy bills.\nThe future looks bright. Following the conclusion of our Kickstarter campaign, we plan to launch Panther Alpha on Amazon and make it readily available to distributors worldwide. We\u2019ll continue to perfect Panther OS with new point releases annually and full releases every two years. To subsidize new Panther OS point releases, we\u2019ll manufacture more powerful ARM-based hardware, always with three key points in mind: lower energy use, affordability, and stability.\nOur ultimate goal is to make Panther Alpha the recognized computing platform to meet the needs of the everyday user, and increase our reach which will result in further developer support and community benefits. Your support is not only a vote to make open source software more secure, more private, and more efficient, but also for your own freedom to use your computer however you please.\nLet\u2019s get the message out there! We want to put the Panther Alpha into the hands of ordinary computer users that stand to benefit from increased privacy, smarter energy consumption, and reduced operating costs. Share our campaign on Facebook and help us make Panther the go-to desktop PC for everyday use.

Such beautiful pens out of sight or under piles of papers was certainly not the answer.\nThe Pen Rest brings that order. It takes up no room, really... it stacks vertically.\nI looked high and low for the perfect, most beautiful totem, desk art for pens I could find... there was just nothing out there! I had created the Worlds FIRST vertical stackable modular Pen Rest.\nPens are precision instruments with billions in use worldwide. Most are kept in a drawer, a mug, or under a pile of paper.\nI love pens of quality, Mont Blanc, Cross, Shaeffer and others to name but a few. To many people they are very desirable, as they offer confidence to the user, portray their image, personality, and have a character all of their own.\nThere are certainly pen holders available and even desk accessories, but none that I ever found could do justice by showing off high quality, often high priced fountain pens, roller ball and mechanical pencils that are so carefully made, detailed often with unique features and designs.\nPerhaps I'm a perfectionist!\nThe Pen Rest had to have the following features for me...\nIt must be a solid object with weight that stopped it sliding about It needed a delicate shelf to place my pen horizontal on it. Visually appealing I wanted to be able to admire my pens A Modular Stackable design I have no idea how many pens I might have now or in the future so I wanted to be able to build on my Pen Rest and keep its aesthetic appeal.\nA brief Background to my design idea..\nI believe a writing instrument should be seen ... clearly and not hidden away.\nI wanted a modular stand too ... one that you could add to as and when you felt like it.\nThe design had to be practical and yet smooth, with rounded edges.\nI was particularly keen that the block should give the appearance of floating and so the chamfered edges give that illusion.\nMaking the block vertical meant little footprint was being taken up. The actual area taken up on a desk is just 60mm x 45mm and yet you can stack as many pens as you like.\nA critical part of the design was to create a centre of gravity that did not change even if you stacked a load of pens.\nThis is because, the weight of each block is 227g, plus the weight of the top of 31g creates a paper weight effect ... a dead weight. As the pens added weigh less than the block... and the centre of gravity is about 20mm from the back of the block, the Pen Rest does not find itself tipping over.\nOnce the CAD drawings were completed I set about getting the right manufacturer and creating prototypes.\nHonestly when I tell you they are old school ... think back old films 1920's! But their workshops are so high tech that they receive work from highly sensitive customers.\nThese guys will be machining the Pen Rest to the absolute finest degree and tolerance that I have ever seen. They manufacture parts for atomic plants and the aircraft industry.\nYou'll be so impressed when you get your Pen Rest.\nOnce the parts are made they go through a variety of processes polishing, sand blasting and anodising before they are complete.\nThis is a very time consuming process that cannot be cut short. To get the highest quality finish every time each Pen Rest is individually cut.\nStackable, Modular and Practical - \"The Pen Rest\"\nThe Pen Rest stacked using three blocks and one top (also a great place to display your ink). The Pen Rest is beautifully shaped to reflect the curves of nature and lovingly display your pens.\nThe silver anodised colour matches Apple Macs very well.\nQuotes from a few people that have seen a sneak preview\n\"as a Mechanical Engineer I was thrilled with what you have done. The design and finishing of the pen rest looks fantastic.\" Thomas Tan www.onfountainpens.com\n\"The Pen Rest is a great idea as too many deserving pens end up being tucked away without being appreciated the way they should. I hope David will reach the 'soft cover' stretch goal.\" - Matthias Meckel Bleistift.memm.de\n\"I like it. I think its a neat idea and design\" Coy - Root Designs R&D\n\"The rest itself is certainly quite aesthetically pleasing, and the anodized aluminum would make it quite enticing as desk top art. Stackability is a big plus - after all, who has only one pen inked at a time? :-)\u201d Ken Cavers kcavers.blogspot.ca\n\u201cI love the design and concept. Very minimalistic and creative\u201d Mark Anthony - Creator of the LYPEN\nI can manufacture the blocks in Gold, Silver or any other anodised colour. If there is interest in other colours during the campaign I will add other colour options.\nThe Pen Rest is unique because it is stackable.\nEach Pen Rest has a 45mm sill that gently balances your pen in the middle so that it is easily accessible but most importantly can be seen in all its glory.\nThe unique sill on which the pen rests on is recessed slightly to allow for the various diameters often attributable to different designs.\nThe gap between each pen is sufficient to pick up a pen without knocking off the others from the Pen Rest.\nEach Pen Rest is manufactured from the high grade materials available. Our first run will be in aluminium using the latest milling and CNC machining techniques. However, stretch goals include the Pen Rest in Stainless Steel, Copper, and 24K Gold Plate.\nBecause of the weight of each Pen Rest, it can be used as a paper weight, but unusually can be stacked as high as you like.\nEach block contains a unique tongue and groove allowing the interlocking of the blocks, so that the lines flow smoothly together.\n3D print shows interlocking and feasibility 3D print shows interlocking and feasibility The chamfers on its edges give a floating appearance at the bottom and a gentle smoothness to edges removing any risk of scratches to your precious pens.\nI believe that your favourite pens should not end up in a mug, or just tossed to one side on the desk. They deserve better than this.\nThey need a home, naturally accessible and solid enough to not move.\nEvery order will receive a free pen. It has the weight and feel of a quality pen and stylish looks.\nI have been looking at protecting the shelf as some feedback from Pen Bloggers have suggested that some additional protection may be required to prevent any chance of marks to pens.... even though the surface is exceptional smooth and the pen only rests on the outer edges.\nSo every order will receive a soft felt cover for the sill with every block sold \nTimeline\nKickstarter ends In November 2016.\nOrders will be dispatched by 12th December 2016 latest in time for Christmas.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Pen Rest One Plus - Early Bird", "descp": "Early Bird - Get a Single Pen Rest in Midnight Blue or Silver block and receive one top of your choice from Silver, Gold, Midnight Blue or Oxford Blue, you'll receive felt to add that quality finish too... but that's not all !

We are confident that we can bring the Memory pen to market with your support! We love our supporters and value your feedback. You will be helping us to define the end product appearances and its features.  \nWe will be MFi approved with the memory Pen\n  Simply plug in the Memory Pen and start downloading your images and videos.\nRunning out of Memory, don't you hate that? You have an event to go to and want to shoot some memorable images and your device is full of images so you no longer have room. Wouldn't you like a low cost secure portable device that fits in a pocket, backpack and purse to download these images and clear space? We did too, so we created the memory pen in 64 and 128Gb versions for IOS and micro USB devices.\nSee what others are saying! \n\"It's something that business managers and entrepreneurs are going to want immediately\"\n    Journalists, medical record keepers, and especially creative types like writers and photographers, are going to love this new wrinkle in mobile device technology.\u201d\n      John Nadeau interviews Andreas Haase\n  Packaging sample with IOS and micro USB versions\nRaptor Creative has created the Human Technology Products brand name to bring you cool CE products. We value Kickstarter and the feedback it supplies us. We will be using the funds to move the Memory Pen into production for Holiday delivery. We know that your support is important to us and we are ready to deliver. \nIn iOS & micro USB versions\nMemory Pen was designed to give you the customer the ability to down load your image and video files securely and quickly. This results in freed up space on your iOS or Micro USB device.  Our application software is still undergoing some final tweaks so that your files will be secure on the Memory Pen. the Memory pen is a 3 in one device so you don't need to carry too many things. First you have 64 to 128Gb of space to fill, then there is the stylus for using your tablets and touch screen devices and if you ever need to use a ball pen for writing down messages, you have that too!\nMemory Pen with Micro USB for Android Devices.\nWe will be offering the Memory Pen in 4 color selections and 2 connector types. Once in production we will offer more choices going forward.\nRight now you need your support to get this product to market. The tooling is completed and the boards are created. A couple tweaks to the software and we are ready to ship in 60 days.  \nPocket clip with Human Technology Logo\n  Plastic molded parts sample\n  Preparing the tooling for the plastic parts\nOur team is comprised of seasoned award winning industrial designers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, sourcing experts and marketing sales.

Yet one key aspect has been generally ignored: the art of introducing the new data science paradigm to legacy enterprises. This is something that requires far more than just a shift in technology. It also requires a shift in corporate culture, sensibilities, and priorities.\nWritten by leading industry consultant Lars Nielsen, Change Management for Data Science provides proven tools for successfully transforming legacy enterprises into true data-driven environments, and gives managers the vital information they need to avoid common pitfalls in this transition. The book is in the last stages of development under the editorial supervision of Edward Renehan, Managing Director of New Street Communications and longtime Director of Computer Publishing Programs for Macmillan.\nThe book's INTRODUCTION:\nTeamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon results. - Andrew Carnegie\nIt's not so much that we're afraid of change or so in love with the old ways, but it's that place in between that we fear. \u2026 It's like being between trapezes. It's Linus when his blanket is in the dryer. There's nothing to hold on to. - Marilyn Ferguson, Futurist\nChange is scary. Change is threatening. Change is annoying. Change is work. But change is also exciting, invigorating, renewing, and refreshing. Change is the evolution, growth, and expansion of horizons. Change is the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d of what has gone before to make way for better, smarter techniques, tools, and technologies. New thinking.\nWhat's the biological alternative to evolution? You guessed it. Extinction. Organizational survival means organizational change. And there's no more important business skill than knowing how to innovate and manage this change.\nI've written Change Management for Data Science with the single intention of arming you with the knowledge and tools necessary to introduce the most draconian changes to hit many a workplace in decades: the parallel revolutions of Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics.\nIn an age when information is everything, or very nearly everything, the flood of the constantly-flowing tsunami of of Big Data has drastically redefined the terrain of countless long-accepted business models and organizational practices.\nIt isn't pretty out there. Anciently established roles are being thrown into states of flux, and traditional chains of authority disrupted. Power is changing hands. Veterans feel demeaned, and some become disgruntled. Experience \u2013 once respected \u2013 has become a suspect thing: an artifact from a prior, antique time; a propeller in the era of the jet engine.\nThe literati among us might be reminded of a line from W.B. Yeats: \u201cThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy is loosed ...\u201d\nBut the \u201ccentre\u201d can and must hold. Anarchy is not an option.\nIt is key for us to make sure that uncertainty among veterans is minimized, disorder avoided, and the threat of chaos stopped in its tracks. It is essential for us to make sure that new shoes do not unduly step on old toes. And it is vital for us to take a situation ripe with potential for rivalries and transform it into an opportunity for building a more sustainable, effective, and profitable team.\nWe must enable all players to understand and buy into the vision of a data-driven workplace: a workplace where professionals acquire, interpret, and leverage data in order to maximize efficiencies, iterate and create new products and services, and otherwise successfully navigate the emerging and constantly changing competitive landscape.\nIn this effort, we must come to understand the importance of the \u201cdemocratization\u201d of data. Granular and key metrics data, once defined, should be shared by all decision makers in the organization, not just amongst the data science team. The data science team should artfully propose conclusions, but not impose them. Conclusions should be jointly arrived at, and should be the result of merging data science results with the experiential knowledge of line-managers and other key professionals.\nAs well, all appropriate professionals \u2013 not just data scientists \u2013 should be armed with the tools, training, and permissions to make their own queries into the firm's data store, whether this be Hadoop-based or otherwise configured.\nAs you'll see in the following chapters, the importance of cooperation and coordination between traditional and non-traditional players cannot be overemphasized. The most important task we face is to marshal and orchestrate this cooperation and coordination, and make it blossom into productive results for the entire enterprise.\nVince Lombardi once commented: Individual commitment to a group effort \u2013 that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work.\nThe \u201cQuants\u201d with all their metrics will hold a key position on your new team, but not the only position. It is important that the players in the field respect the work of the pitcher, but equally important that they know the pitcher respects them and understands their role as being vital - especially since several of the outfielders were once pitchers.\nWith that in mind, let us proceed ...\nAbout the Author\nBased in Amsterdam, Lars Nielsen has more than three decades of experience consulting for such firms as IBM, CBS, Amgen, Intel, and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). His books include the bestsellers A Simple Introduction to Data Science, What Every Manager Should Know About Data Science, and Computing: A Business History, of which none other than the late Andy Grove (co-founder and longtime Chairman of Intel) said: \"Nielsen provides a most excellent and understandable narrative of a complex history.

This is the YouTube generation, and it's important that communication be clear, concise, and generate a real connection with the viewer. So many blogs are shot and loosely edited together, and they don't have to be. With a prompter that is voice activated (for iOS), or speed controlled (android), video creators can now create more dynamic video with a true eye-to-eye experience.\nAlso, actors often have to do commercial shoots involving a prompter script, as do politicians, priests, and political pundits. It's important to have a device that can record the speaker, while also allowing for prompting. Plus, by sliding the prompter off-center, actors can read left or right of cam, doing video based auditions of lengthy roles.\nWhat if there was a soldier, Sgt. GoodDad, and he wanted to read bedtime stories for his/her child without having the books to carry? He could get the script emailed, and RECORD bedtime stores for his child to watch on Youtube privately. And make that eye-to-eye connection with the camera, when he can't be face to face.\nAn interrotron is a device where two people have a discussion and it is recorded for emotional and psychiatric discussion. Here, you can do a 'facetime' between two mobile devices, while recording the emotional expressions on the laptop. \nShare now please!\n Benefits & Features:\n\u2022 Optical teleprompter glass ensures clarity for the best video quality\n\u2022 Heavy duty weatherproof case protects your Micro 750 during transport\n\u2022 Lighting can be rotated in/out for a dimming effect\n\u2022 Modification ability allows for shooting with DSLR's\n\u2022 Actors can open the rear panel, slide off-center, and shoot web based auditoins.\n\u2022 YouTuber's can create better videos with the same tech from expensive broadcast prompters.\n\u2022 Ports for chargers and/or microphones\n\u2022 Compact size\n\u2022 Works best with iPhone\u00ae/iPad\u00ae but also works with android software.\nWho this is for:\nIf you EVER are going to create an online video, you should back this project. According to YouTube, 1 out of 3 people connected to the internet have uploaded a video to YouTube. Not to mention all the CEO Messages, HR Videos, Acoustic Jams, Priest Sermons, College Entrance Videos, Video Game Blogs, and even Political Candidates.\nFor the Troops:\nWe were hoping that soldiers overseas would read bedtime stories right into the camera, and upload those videos to YouTube so their children back home can have video bedtime stories with eye-to-eye contact. Just drop the story onto a Google Drive, or DropBox, and the script uploads with ease to most mobile prompting software. (Featured here is PromptSmart for iPhone)\nStretch Goal:\nIf we break $60,000 we will include a lens cleaning cloth for the glass. We will also include an additional laser cut 16:9 rear matte-board that can be swapped out for DSLR's. This way you won't have to cover the rear with a black cloth on the DSLR modification, you can just slide the camera up against the cut matte-board in the down position. We will also put some Tompter stickers in the package too, because everyone loves stickers.\nAbout the lighting:\nWe have included two USB 2.0 light sticks that are hooked to a 'Y' cable so you can plug them into most laptops. Some laptops don't have a USB, but that's ok, there is those USB wall plugs, and USB batteries that can power the lights. They are for you to experiment. One idea is to rotate the light inward, effectively blocking some of it (dimming on the fly). So, we encourage you to make your own videos, and share them with Tompter. we would love to see what you created with the Tompter Micro 750! Show us your videos, auditions and more!\nNon-US shipping:\nNon-US shipping is about $90. I wish I could get it lower because I know so many of my fans of my other custom teleprompter products reside in other countries. If I get emails here for a particular country, I don't mind opening it up here for you to back this project! Just understand it's about $90 to ship it. I get a break on two. If I ship two, it's $115... so it's much better to back in pairs.\nNew side design with charging hole:\nNew charging/mic cable hole added to the design!\n  Here is a sample of laser engraving for large orders!\n  \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\nDisclaimer:\nHardware only.

The only problem is that no-one wants do that.\nThere\u2019s too much money in consulting and selling books about the veneer without ever giving up the actual secret sauce.\n\u201cThis book and video course won\u2019t be like that. In fact, they\u2019ll be very different from that, and probably nothing like what you\u2019re used to. Here\u2019s why: Secret Sauce is not so much a book as it is a tutorial.\nSecret Sauce is a step-by-step, systematic dismantling and dissection of every channel and practice that actually works, laid out one after another. It\u2019s a guide that will handhold you all the way to getting traffic, users, and revenue.\nOur goal with this book and course is that someone who knows absolutely nothing about marketing could sit down, follow the instructions, and make what they\u2019re doing blow up. We\u2019ve done this before - a lot.\nOur combined efforts account for millions of monthly pageviews, millions of social followers, millions of emails, millions of dollars in revenue -- no matter how you slice it, this stuff just works. We\u2019ve tried hundreds of growth hacks in order to give you only the methods we know will work.\nMost everything you\u2019ll read is something anyone can do with a little bit of effort, and which requires very little (or zero) marketing budget.\nBy the time you finish this book, you will not only have a dozen ideas about different strategies that can help your idea succeed, but you\u2019ll know exactly what it takes to implement each one of them.\nAfter you read this book you will be able to sell units of and get users signed up for literally anything.\nWhat you\u2019ll find in the growth hacking playbook works.\nI was on welfare/benefits 3 years ago, and used growth hacking techniques to get millions of visitors to websites I created and raise hundreds of thousands of dollars in investment, and got into the Techstars accelerator. I then launched a growth hacking agency and have used these techniques to move hundreds of thousands of people to websites, and acquire tonnes of users and followers for startups.\nSpeaking in London, England, Winter 2015\nA key change in my life happened a year ago. An accelerator had heard I was a \u201cgrowth hacker\u201d and asked me to give a talk to their current teams. I put together a slide deck of what I considered the basics, and gave a presentation. Halfway through my talk I realised half of the room was taking pages of notes, while the others stared at me in disbelief. The minute my talk finished, founders ran up to me asking for my slides and if I did consulting. I was surprised- I hadn\u2019t seen many people in marketing give talks and presumed you were meant to give practical advice and show people how to do things, pieces of software you can use to automate things, etc. this was not the case. I gave more talks and it\u2019s an incredible feeling how much people find my talks useful. That\u2019s where the idea for this book came from. Give as many people practical, actionable advice and strategies as possible. My growth hacking talk was eventually voted best workshop of SXSW V2V 2015. Earlier this year I gave a 30-date speaking tour of America, and am so excited to get this knowledge out there in full for the first time.\nThis is the first time I\u2019m pulling back the curtain and unveiling my secrets, along with my co-author Austen Allred, who has moved millions of visitors and dollars through growth hacking across every channel from SEO to Pinterest and everything inbetween.\nWhat you\u2019ll discover in Secret Sauce can be used for good or evil. It is very powerful stuff. Right now, only a few people know how to do these things. We\u2019re blowing the whistle on the tactics other people are using, and handing you the tools to do them yourself, and find your secret sauce.\nAnd with that substantial word of warning, we launch our kickstarter. If this book gets funded, it will be available very soon after the Kickstarter ends (like, by the end of June or mid-July at the very latest). We\u2019re not sure what the blowback is going to be as no-one has done a book like this before. If you\u2019ve ever read a marketing book and found it didn\u2019t contain enough specific strategies to try, the growth hacking playbook is for you. If you work in marketing and want to use new techniques to boost your companies brand and get promoted, this book is for you. And if you run your own company, you are going to adore this book.\nSecret Sauce will give you the tools you need to execute growth hacking strategies in a wide range of environments\u2014but I have another goal in sharing it with you. \nAs many have pointed out to me, I could keep this information to myself and make more money from clients- but I truly believe we\u2019re all better off if we share the knowledge and grow our companies together. As such, everyone who donates anything will be invited into a private growth hacking group on Facebook, where we\u2019ll create an ongoing community to help each other with our digital marketing and startup growth problems. I wish there had been a group like this when I was on welfare and starting out on my company three years ago, rather than having to learn it all by trial and error. There\u2019ll be no links or spam in the group, just questions, answers, and discussions from and to the community around this area which has so little useful information. This will make sure that the learning will continue after the campaign ends.\nThose of you who have followed me for a while know that when give a talk, I love to go big\u2014ridiculously big\u2014in offering as much value as possible.\nWe\u2019ve created several different backer reward levels with lots of rewards for each bracket.\nTier 1 \u201cGROWTH HACKER\u201d will receive:\nA digital copy of the seven-part growth hacking book.\n- Entrance to the secret growth hackers\u2019 club on Facebook\n- Thank you page in the book.

The slim, padded carry case makes transporting Pillarhub easy and safe while the simple, sleek design means you can use it with any style of computer and it can fit right alongside your laptop in your carry bag.\nIntroducing Pillarhub\nPillarhub comes with USB 3 and USB C compatibility\nOur Story\nThe Pillarhub team got together over the common frustration of find a truly portable monitor that was slim enough to not add too much extra bulk over the laptop. We were all fed up with fiddling with software or working with half hearted solutions. There was no one product or solution that we could take with us while traveling. After the frustrations cleared, we got our heads together and came up with the following checklist that would make the perfect solution for us:\nIt needs to be light and portable\nIt needed a good screen\nIt needed to run with no power cables (or ability to charge)\nIt needed to fit into my laptop bag\nWith that in mind we got to work and went through a few iterations before settling on a 2 screen system. There was always a fear that the second screen would add too much bulk and would make the product non-viable. We worked with our manufactures to chip away at the weight and slim down the panel until we are now confident that the added bulk is no longer a compromise.\nWe\u2019ve since worked with a dozen manufactures to ensure the high quality of our panels and spend countless hours on the 3D printer prototyping parts to finalize Pillarhub. We believe that the powerless setup was a big leap and we are proud to share the Pillarhub product with the world. Help us spread the word so we can showcase our product to the world.

For those of you who are familiar with large-scale electronic manufacturing(molds, wiring, inputs, etc); there are often overlaps from facilities which produce for multiple brands (e.g. Ho Hai Precision industry (trading as FoxConn) manufacturing for Apple at facilities that are not wholly owned by Apple; thus Ho Hai makes devices for multiple Chinese brands beyond Apple and often phones are using similar if not identical technologies.) This is similar to our case, as we do not have the resources to setup a screen manufacturing facility in China, so contacted many facilities in an effort to find a solution that met our needs; often which have overlap such as using similar tapered design, brightness controls, etc. that will work with our custom 3D stands.)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Product Sketches & Images", "update_content": "WOW!!!

It records their tremors and provides detailed insights about how their activities and diet affect their tremors. \nFacebook | Twitter | Instagram | Website | Press Kit | support@trequant.com\nShare us on Facebook & Twitter\nTrequant helps you to be more confident and aware of your situation, by letting you know how your tremors work. \n Tremors are completely unpredictable, even the slightest change in your mood can cause huge changes in your tremor intensities and you have no control over it. With Trequant you can observe and identify what activities affect your tremors positively or the diet that helps you to reduce your tremors. You can also connect with a community of tremor patients and share your problems, or solutions with the community. You are able to share your tremor intensities and collaborate in friendly challenges that motivate you to perform daily exercises that are beneficial to you as a tremor patient.\nThe graphs visualize how with changed activity i.e increased morning walk and a nap during the work stress John was able to reduce the intensity of his tremors. He has a better understanding of how his activities affect his tremors, now he can choose what helps him. This will help him control his tremors better and be more confident.\n Trequant is collaborating with thehopenet.org to get the donations into the hands of rightful patients so they can benefit from it the most and help align their activities to handle their tremors better.\nTremors are unintentional shaking or trembling of muscles. It is the most common neurological movement disorder and hands are the most commonly affected parts. Other parts of the body include head, vocal cords, trunk, and legs. It isn't a life threatening disease but makes life difficult, even the simplest daily tasks become really hard\n Its as simple as it gets, once the watch is paired with the companion application, you're a tap away from recording your tremors.\nTrequant allows tremor patients to easily record the values of their tremor intensities accurately without even thinking about it. It allows you to go about your daily routine doing the tasks you do and records your tremors silently. All you have to do is wear it on your wrist and start recording, and it gathers your tremor intensity based on kinetic vibrations of your tremors. It uses 6 sensors to monitor the movement of your arm. Our proprietary algorithm records the accurate value of the tremor intensity by filtering out normal hand movements. Not just that, the device comes equipped with vibration motor to remind you of your medications.\nTrequant companion application (which can be used both on a mobile or a computer) is an extension of the wearable. The application allows you to record your tremors, or set up medication reminders, and the type of recording you want to do. The application creates detailed insights of your tremors and lets you see for yourself what activities or diets affect your tremors positively. It can let you know if your tremors have been intense throughout the day or not.\nThe design of the wearable has been carefully chosen after numerous iterations along with your feedback. Minimal and strong to make you feel in control, and it saves you from all the weird looks.   \n The mobile application is built keeping you in mind, simple, extremely easy to navigate and great readable design for non-technical people. The application is completely self explanatory, and completely friendly.\nTrequant houses 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscopes, which allows the wearable to accurately determine the vibrations in the body caused by tremors. Isolating the tremor vibration, Trequant determines the detailed amplitude and frequency values which helps define the tremor in numbers to be understood in a more rational way. \nTrequant has been in the works for 2 years now. Let us give you an insight into the different stages:\n We have been working for two years, and in two years we have developed 4 different prototypes of our product. We now have our final prototype and all we need is your support to finish this product and get this into the hands of people.\nTrequant watch was designed to keep it classic so people feel comfortable wearing it in public. Reaching to the final stage required a lot of changes and feedback from product design & manufacturing experts. These are the dimensions of the watch:\nThe watch is is just about the size of a normal watch with double the intelligence. It is suited for both the genders.\n Trequant makes use of the latest technologies available in the market, including:\n6-axis motion sensor to accurately record tremor movements\nVibration motor for medication reminders\nSwiss watch movement to show time\nUltra low power processor and bluetooth low energy for long battery life\nExtra memory to save data for a month \nLithium polymer battery to power for 7 days \nLeather straps for comfortable wear\nAfter discussing the manufacturing with various famous names in the manufacturing sector we have choses PanAsia Solutions http://panasia-inc.com as our partner. They have finalized the dates along with the feasibility reports that certify the manufacturing of Trequant in the given time frame and costs. \nPanAsia specializes in the manufacturing and distribution of the hardware products and the company is behind some of the biggest names in the industry. Panasia Solutions provides us on the ground presence in China. They have 15 years of experience in designing, refining, and producing branded consumer products for sale and distribution in markets throughout the United States, Canada, and the EU.\nAs we anticipated some patients who cant really make use of a watch requested for a bracelet/band that fulfilled the basic purpose. After numerous iterations we present the Trequant Band. We haven't built a prototype for the band yet but based on our previous designs and the technology equipped in the final prototype of the watch we are 110% confident that this would be the final shape, size, battery life and technology of the Band.\nThis band comes in multiple sizes and you'd be able to put it on different body parts, such as your head, thighs etc. We will be introducing multiple attachments for ease of use on any part of your body as a stretch goal. And if we are able to cross the stretch goal the attachments will be given to all the people who have pledged for the band.\nThe technology used in the band is same as the watch, but to avoid  any confusion here is the breakdown: \n-6-axis motion sensor to accurately record tremor movements.\n-Vibration motor for medication reminders.\n-Ultra low power processor and bluetooth low energy for long battery life.\n-Extra memory to save data for a month.\n-Lithium polymer battery to power for 7 days.\nTrequant companion application is a multiple platform application, which means it can be run on your mobile phone, or personal computer both.\nWe understand not everyone has a smartphone and or is able to use one, especially those who suffer from extreme tremors. Trequant can easily be connected with your computer using our usb. \n*Some Laptops come with built-in Bluetooth BLE. You might not need the USB at all, however we are sending out free USBs to everyone who pledges to buy our wearable.\nTrequant Circle, be a part of something bigger the best way to stay connected with the people you love.\nTrequant Circle is an exclusive idea being introduced by Trequant. The purpose of the Trequant circle is to link the people with tremors via a unique chain. Because we believe you are who know the best about you because we believe that in order to find a solution for this problem people need to be encouraged to talk to each other, indulge in collaborative discussions and find answers to their problems including tremor anomalies. With Trequant Circle, people can add their friends, share their tremor stories in complete confidence with each other for discussion or collaborative analysis and motivate with each other with the help of positive competition.\nWith detailed discussions and deals with the manufacturer we have been able to workout our goal and where it has to go.\nBy supporting this project, you are also contributing to the future of Trequant. These funds will help Trequant progress from prototype stage to a power system that is ready for the global market.

You can use \"Pre-Order\" button above (well, it should appear as soon as the project is over).  Or, as an alternative, you can wait for a Kickstarter for Vol.2 of the book; we certainly plan it, and we certainly plan to have \"Vol.1+Vol.2\" option there (though we do not provide any formal guarantees).

After 20 years in the AAA industry, this project is teaching me new things. Even if it was just half as ambitious as it is, it would be a must-have.\"- Matt Pritchard, AAA Industry veteran, developer of RTS games, FPS, Mobile F2P, and IoT devices, author and expert on multiplayer cheating.\nWhat's the Big Idea?\nOne of 20+ illustrations from Vol.1\nThe idea behind this book is to summarize the body of knowledge that already exists on multiplayer games but is not available in one single place. And quite a few of the issues discussed within this series (planned as three volumes 400+ pages each), while known in the industry, have not been published at all (except for maybe in discussion forums). \nProgramming and deploying an MOG is a daunting task, and having a frame of reference is usually quite helpful \u2014 \"hey, those guys have already tried this, and it worked for them.\"\nBy the end of Vol. 1, we'll complete our discussion of the things related to architecting your MOG, and will be ready to start discussing \"Development\" (Vol. 2) and \"Deployment\" (Vol. 3). For more details on what's within the book, see the tentative Table of Contents (it also includes links to all the beta chapters from Vol. 1). \nThis current project is only about Vol. 1, \"Architecture,\" but Vol. 2 and Vol. 3 are already planned (and obviously my enthusiasm about them will get an additional boost when Vol. 1 is successfully funded ;-)). \nWhy Me?\nI really hate to speak about myself, but this is one of those cases where I don't have much choice. So, here it goes (and if you really want further details, you can dig them out of my LinkedIn page).\n20 years ago (damn, I am getting old) I was a co-architect for an electronic stock exchange of a G20 country, and for all practical intents and purposes stock exchanges are just another game genre. The project was fun and, among other things, allowed for real-time trading over the cellphones of that time (those with 9600 baud connection).\nA few years later, I became a chief software architect working for a start-up that quickly grew into a rather large online game with half a million simultaneous players that processed half a billion user transactions per day. The project taught me a damn lot about such different issues as scalability, DB physical layout, server farms, attackers and cheaters of all kinds, and bot fighting \u2014 just to name a few.\nSince then, I have consulted and performed due diligence on several game-related projects. In addition, I've spent quite some time researching the field and discussing related problems and their respective solutions with people from the industry.\nI feel that this puts me in quite a unique position of knowing not only one single game, but a bunch of them, and being able to summarize and generalize my real-world experiences. Oh, and I have been writing for industry journals (and am especially proud of articles in CUJ and C++ Report) since 1998, so the process of typing sentences is not something new for me either.\nSince When Are Rabbits Programming??\nFrom an 2010 article in Overload\nI cannot speak for all of rabbitkind, but this particular hare has gone alongside my writings for quite a while now. He was born as \"No MT Bugs\" Hare in 2010, in an Overload article titled \"Single-Threading: Back to the Future?\"\nTherefore, there is evidence that this particular rabbit has been programming at least since 2010. Yes, he has changed his appearance, but deep inside, he is still the very same bunny with a na\u00efve idea of making programs less buggy. BTW, the character is created by Sergey Gordeev, a guy with many animation awards, known (among other things) for being a director of some of the Animated Mr. Bean series.\nWho Is this Book For?\nThe book is intended for those intermediary developers who want to become senior ones, and for senior developers and up. I expect that the book will also be useful for decision-makers, from PMs all the way up to CEOs \u2014 so if you by any chance know one, please make sure to give her a link to this page ;-). \nOn the other hand, if you are working on your first programming project, this book will probably be too difficult for you. There will be no explanation on what event-driven programming is all about, what the difference is between optimistic locking and pessimistic locking, why you need a source control system, and so on. Instead, there will be discussions on how the concept of futures fits into event-driven programming, when the use of optimistic locking make sense for games, and how to use source control in the presence of unmergeable files. \nIn the same spirit, the book is not intended to be a CD to copy-paste your sample MOG from. Instead, the book aims to help you write your own code that is tailored to your own needs, and tries to advise on the available choices at most of the junctions.\nWhat's the Plan?\nCurrently, the \"beta\" chapters of the Vol.1 are already available on my blog ithare.com. The same \"beta\" posts are also available re-formatted as a single PDF (11.1M, 355 PDF pages; please note that this is NOT how the book is going to look). \nSteps still to complete to bring the \"beta\" draft into the shape of the ready-for-printing Vol.1:\nRestructure Vol.1. Done.\nGo through Vol.1 again, \"harmonizing\" and clarifying things. I expect to add about 30'000 words during this process (give or take). Current progress: ~30% completed, 12'000 words already added. ETA: July 2016. At this point all the backers will get an (MS Word) draft.\nMake another pass through Vol.1, this time is more about self-editing (not that much will need be changed at this stage, I hope). ETA: August 2016. At this point all the backers should get another (MS Word) draft.\nGive it to a professional copyeditor. Cost estimate: $3100 (140'000 words @ $0.022/word). ETA: September 2016. At this point all the backers will get yet another (MS Word) draft. \nGive it to a book design/layout specialist. Cost estimate: $2900 ($500 overall design + 400 pages@$6/page). ETA: October 2016. At this point E-BOOK rewards will be sent out.\nPrint paperbacks with CreateSpace, and get them sent to backers. ETA - November 2016. At this point PAPERBACK rewards will be sent out.\nStart selling Vol.1 on Amazon (planned price is $24.95 for Kindle, and $34.95 for paperback)\nBecome rich and retire to the Bahamas ;-). On second thought - this book probably won't suffice ;-(.\nWhat's Inside?\nPretty much all MOG genres are within the scope of the book, from MMOFPS on one side of the spectrum to social games on the other side \u2014 with stock exchanges and multi-player casino games in between. However, things such as gameplay (including AI), and monetization are intentionally left out. In addition, the areas of physics and 3D graphics are too large by themselves and \u2014 to avoid expanding this into a 10-volume series \u2014 are only discussed very briefly (with pointers to good books on these subjects provided).\nAn excerpt from the tentative full ToC of the Vol.1: \nChapter I. Game Design Document from an MOG Perspective\nChapter II. On Cheating, P2P, and [non-]Authoritative Servers\nChapter III. Protocols\nRTT, Input Lag, and How to Mitigate Them (includes Client-Side Interpolation, Client-Side Prediction, and Lag Compensation)\nGame World States and Reducing Traffic Publishable State, Interest Management, and different Compression techniques)\nPoint-to-Point Communications and Non-Blocking RPCs (including discussion on message queues)\nIDL (includes hints on writing your own IDL compiler)\nChapter IV. DIY vs Re-Use. In Search of Balance\nChapter V. Event-Driven Programming\nClassical Event-Driven Programs\nDeterministic Event-Driven Programs (including benefits such as production post-mortem for both client and server, replay testing, and so on)\nRPC Processing in Event-Driven Programs: from Plain Event Processing to Futures (with lambda call pyramids in between)\nRelation to Actors, Node.js, and Erlang\nChapter VI. Client-Side Architecture\nGraphics (only very basics)\nProgramming Language for Client-Side\nClient-Side Architecture Diagram (based on multiple event-driven objects)\nChapter VII. Server-Side Architecture\nNa\u00efve Architectures\nWeb-Based Architecture (including write-back caching and locking strategies)\nClassical Architecture\nFront-End Servers\nLoad Balancing (including Round-Robin DNS, Server-Side Balancing and Client-Side Random Balancing)\nEternal Linux-vs-Windows Debate\nProgramming Languages for Server-Side\nChapter VIII. Unity 5 vs UE4 vs Photon vs DIY for MOG\nChapter IX. Pre-Coding Checklist: Things Everybody Hates, but Everybody Needs. From Source Control to Coding Guidelines\nChapter IX concludes Vol.1; for the list of the Chapters planned in Vol.2 and Vol.3, see the full tentative ToC.\nSTRETCH GOAL @10K: +50% ILLUSTRATIONS - REACHED!\nAs we have reached our first stretch goal @EUR 8K, it is time to announce our NEXT STRETCH GOAL. If we reach EUR10'000, then we'll ask our illustrator Sergey Gordeev (who is more known for his animation awards and directing Animated Mr Bean) to draw additional 10 or so illustrations for the book, increasing the number of illustrations in Vol. 1 by approximately 50%!\nIn addition, if we reach this goal, it will be our backers who decide on the face of the 'No Bugs' which is used in the book (see options here: http://ithare.com/facelift-for-no-bugs/ ). While we already had a vote on it on the site, results were not conclusive, so (at least for the book) we'll defer to the vote of our Kickstarter backers!\nSTRETCH GOAL @8K: \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL\" EDITION - REACHED!\nAs we're now 100% funded (BIG THANKS TO ALL THE BACKERS!), here comes our STRETCH GOAL (which will become available at reaching the number of EUR8000). If we reach this stretch goal, all the backers will have a choice to have their books/e-books shipped/downloaded either as \"regular\" books, or as \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" books, with the latter only available to Kickstarter backers.\nThese \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" books/e-books will get a new cover (probably with \"KICKSTARTER SPECIAL EDITION\" on it), a special \"THANK YOU\" page (and probably a separate ISBN too, though it doesn't really matter). Our illustrator will start working on the Kickstarter cover as soon as we reach this stretch goal, so you will see it sooner rather than later...\nOn \"VIRTUAL PRESENCE\" Consulting\nTwo of the rewards mention \"VIRTUAL PRESENCE\" Consulting. It will be as if I came to your office for the specified number of days. However, I will come not in person, but over Skype or something similar. You will describe your problems to me, and I\u2019ll do my best to advise you on how to solve them. A few notes regarding this:\nHow I use my time during these days is up to you. You tell me your story, I listen; you show me a document, I read it; you ask me for advice, I go offline for some time and come back with the best solution I can think of.\nWith this in mind, it makes sense to ask me questions at the end of one day to get some advice the next day. While technically I am not obligated to think between the days, I am unlikely to be able to keep myself from thinking about a challenging problem ;-)\n100% confidentiality is assured (well, save for somebody hijacking the Skype channel or something).\nPlease do NOT assume that you can hire me at these rates outside of this Kickstarter project. Beyond this Kickstarter project (for which I have special permission) it will need to be done through my employer and, to the best of my knowledge, it is going to be MUCH more expensive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the moment, the project is already at a rather advanced stage.

Prodigious processors concentrated in 14 nm, with an amount of energy consumption of 5 or 6 Watt.\nThe UDOO X86 embedds the newest Arduino\u2122 101, with all the upgrades - including 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope and Bluetooth Low Energy connectivity.\nThe Arduino\u2122-compatible platform onboard is connected with the main processor through an internal USB port.\nIn terms of software UDOO X86 is compatible with the official Arduino\u2122 101 IDE and with all the sketches, tutorials and resources available in the Arduino\u2122 101 community.\nSpeaking of hardware, UDOO X86 has the same pinout layout of Arduino\u2122 101. In other words, UDOO X86 is compatible with all Arduino\u2122 101-compatible shields, sensors and actuators.\nThe board operating voltage and I/O is 3.3V but all pins are also protected against 5V overvoltage.\nWhy is an Arduino\u2122 101-compatible module such a great addition to this board? \nUDOO X86 can be used to program the Arduino\u2122-compatible module directly with the standard Arduino\u2122 IDE.\n  But the ace in the hole of UDOO X86 is the communication between the Intel\u00ae Quad Core processor and the Arduino\u2122-compatible plaform. The interconnection between the two systems is the distinctive feature of UDOO, and this time we have pushed this interaction even further. The board is designed to allow the Arduino\u2122 101-compatible microcontroller to run when the powerful CPU is powered off, and wake it up when something's happened in the world. IoT gets easy. \nUDOO X86 supports a multiboot configuration and boot from everywhere, being even more flexible.\n\nBut what really makes UDOO X86 a true PC is its flexibility, first of all in terms of storage: UDOO X86 mounts 8 GB eMMC on board, a Micro SD card reader as well as SATA, M.2 Key B and USB 3.0 ports to attach your new-generation hard disk.\n\n\nUDOO X86 is also above the standard in terms of software flexibility: on UDOO X86 you can run any x86-compatible OS: Linux\u00ae, Windows\u00ae or Android\u2122.\n\nMoreover, the processors we've chosen are specifically dedicated to the PC domain. \n\n \n\nThe UDOO X86 can connect over Gigabit Ethernet.\n\nMoreover it has an M.2 connector that can connect over Wi-Fi 802.11ac and Bluetooth Low Energy via an external Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy module, that you'll get if you choose the Performance Kit here on Kickstarter and, once the product is shipped, on sale in our shop.  \n\nIn case you're wondering, you can use any Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module already available on the market.\nNot only this: the Arduino\u2122 101-compatible has its own embedded Bluetooth Low Energy module embedded to seamlessly communicate with wireless sensors, smartphones and tablets.\nNeed some ideas?\nWatch Netflix, Sky Go, Amazon Instant Videos or other streaming platforms in the quiet calm of a fanless Home Theather Personal Computer;\nadd a USB DVB-T2 tuner to turn whatever attached monitor into a Digital Terrestrial Television;\nexploit the HDMI-CEC to allow UDOO X86 connected to your TV through HDMI port to communicate back-and-forth with your TV and thus, to control UDOO X86 through your remote control;\nuse your mobile phone or any RC5 IR-enabled remote control.\n\nAll the retrogaming old glories fits in your pocket. \nUse UDOO X86 also as a Steam\u00a9 in-home streaming machine for your main Steam\u00a9-machine: you can play in a different room or even remotely over 7,500 videogames!\nPower to the gamers!\n  UDOO X86 is Home PC  \nSurf the web. Check your email. Edit your holiday pictures on Photoshop. Update your Facebook status. Write a novel with Microsoft\u00ae Word\u00ae. Read the newspaper. \nStill need a netbook?\nFinally comes a fast compiling board, so to let you experiment also when you're short on time - at hackathons or in class - a board which is compatible with all the resources for the PC and Arduino\u2122 world, well-documented and supported by an open source community: you won\u2019t ever feel alone as a teacher.\nConsidering its compatibility with Arduino\u2122 and the gargantuan amount of resources for the PC world, no other single board computer is supported as much.\nNeed even more power?

As more mosquitoes lay their eggs, the pheromone concentration increases and this specific location become more attractive to other mosquitoes.\nHow Does It Work?\nWe have created a proprietary mixture, based on the mosquitoes-friendly swamps of Southern Louisiana, which is already attractive to mosquitoes. When you set the trap, you include this liquid which will entice the mosquitoes in your environment to lay their eggs there. This is when the magic happens\u2026\nMosquitoes lay their eggs, and while doing so release their pheromone into the liquid to signal to other mosquitoes this is a safe place. \n Every three to five days, you drain the liquid, discard the filter and the eggs, and put the liquid back in the trap. As more mosquitoes lay their eggs, the pheromone content in the solution (fluid) increases, making your trap the most popular place for female mosquitoes.\nSoon, your trap has the highest concentration of pheromone in your environment, and the vast majority of the mosquitoes lay their eggs it\u2026 \u2026 and get discarded as well. Leaving you without mosquitoes!\nThe Trap\nThe trap is sturdy, made of metal (aluminum or copper) and decorative. \nThe trap is about 12\" high, with a cap about 6\" high. It is highly durable and will last for years.\nIt's shipped with a quart (liter) of the starting breeder liquid to attract mosquitoes, and a year-long supply of filters to replace every 3-5 days.\nPerfect for Gardeners and People Who Care about Their Enviroment\nThe ideal person to use this is someone with a yard or garden, and who takes care of it regularly.

Standalone server.\nVery powerful and flexible, indeed! But \u2026\nWhat happens if someone steals your NAS disks, your SD card, or your USB drive? \nWhat happens if someone sniffs the sensors' or actuators' communication lines and steals your telemetry? \nCan you afford to expose your data? Or \u2026\nWorst-case scenario: since RBPi is easily available, all your products can be replicated by your competitor.  \nEven worse: what if a system mimics one of your authorized machines? (Man in the Middle attack).\n\u2026 Can you afford to lose your business?\nWe want strong security, so we cannot rely on software-generated keys/certificates because they do not use true random generated numbers. At the same time, this strong protection system must not overload RBPi's processor, nor collapse its OS.\nWe're proud to introduce PiSec, the best security solution to your Rasbpberry Pi (and all devices with a SPI bus).\nRBPi + PiSec = 360\u00ba security\nPiSec is a hardware solution. No previous experience on security is required and you don\u2019t need to study complex security algorithms or write long pieces of code. All you need to do to secure your RBPi-based system is to plug PiSec on it.\n\nReduced development costs and faster time to market!\nPiSec features:\nPiSec features:\nA True Random Number Generator (TRNG).

Please scroll down to find out the details.\n========================================\nIntroducing the QooPow\u2122 qualMeter\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter is a revolutionary, smart and cost-efficient DIY device, which can simply help you to diagnostic and get to know the quality of your USB cables and chargers in a glance without any technical background. \nWith qualMeter around, you will never need to worry about on getting wrong cables and chargers for your precious smartphone or tablet.\nSpecial rewards exclusively for BackerClub's Members only!\nqualMeter handles wide range of mainstream USB charging cables. It also tests loading capability of the 5v chargers to roughly define their quality.\nOur motivation for creating the QooPow\u2122 qualMeter was from the observation that there are too many low quality and compromised charging products in the market, especially 3rd-party charging cables and chargers. There is lacking of an easy and simple way to measure the quality of charging cables and chargers for people.\nIn our daily life, USB cables and chargers are playing big role of mobile device charging, therefore their quality is critical for the charging. Low quality charging cables and chargers could cause serious damage on your mobile devices or might even burn down your house. You can easily find tons of images, videos and stories by simply search Google and YouTube with keywords like charging cable burning, charger on fire etc. \nGoogle Search Screen Shot about \"charging cable burning \"\nWell, a burning or something on fire is very obvious to us to catch. The question is how can we find it out before it burns? or even before we buy it?\nFurthermore, there are also other important but hidden impacts that most of people wouldn\u2019t know in a easy way such as slow charging, strange behaviors on smart phone when charging, dropping data transfer and so on. The following Tip would give you some ideas about how a low quality charging cable will cause slow charging.\nTech Tips:\nWondering why is your charging so slow? A non-qualified charging cable could have a dramatic voltage drop. For example, if your charging cable's impedance is 500m\u03a9, which many low quality cables do. It will have 0.5v drop @1A charging current, that means you will only get 4.5v at the phone end when your charger provides 5v for charging. Most of smart phones won't even charge in this case. That explains a lot of charging issues we have.\nA Low Quality Cable at Charging\nIn addition, the charging current is now getting higher and higher due to massive application of smart devices. Many devices are charged at 2A or above such as pads and tablets etc. The quality of charging cable has become critical nowadays. Take the given example above, it will have 1v dropping if you are charging at 2A current which leads to only 4v to the device end. Beside the safety issue you may have, there will be certainly no charging at this low voltage for smart devices.\nFYI, Check out this USB charging cable review video from YouTube: \uff08in case if you are not able to watch here, here is the link: https://youtu.be/doMHmGatyYc\uff09\nUnfortunately, like the above video, to evaluate the performance of the charging cable and charger is not really an easy task for most of non-tech people or even sometimes for tech people. It requires not only some electronic knowledge but also needs expensive testing equipment. People find it's very hard to deal with all different kind of massive charging products.\nNow, with qualMeter, we\u2019ll be able to make differences. It is a revolutionary product that allows everyone to have the easiest and smarter way to rule the charging.\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter was initially made for our own lab demanding as we are developing smart and fast charging products for mobile devices. The purpose of making such tool was based on the situation that we needed to roughly measure the different qualities of the cables/chargers and their impact on our products\u2019 performance. \nWith qualMeter, we are able to easily category the pile of cables and chargers without complicated reading and analyzing. When some of our friends were showing their great interests in this little device, we started to realize that it could benefit others. So we decided to take qualMeter to Kickstarter and to share with you.\nPart of qualMeter's testing environment\nOne of our friends, Rebecca, was suspecting on one of her new bought charging cables, which always felt hot when charging. We gave Rebecca one of our qualMeter prototypes for testing. By using the qualMeter, she was able to find out this cable was in a bad condition before the wire burns on fire. She then checked rest of her cables and chargers, and was able to eliminate 2 other bad cables and 1 bad charger. The next day, Rebecca went shopping. With a little help from qualMeter she bought 3 good cables in a decent price. The businessman was shocked to see her using qualMeter and even asked her where to get one. Lol~ Rebecca was extremely happy with qualMeter, because she's smarter. \nWhat makes the qualMeter so unique is it comes along with a simple idea that everyone can measure the quality of random cable/charger in a simple way, an affordable way. It intends to provide an easy and simple solution in a fairly low cost. \nqualMeter is designed for non-tech people but can certainly be used by tech-savvies for roughly testing as well.\nWho needs QooPow\u2122 qualMeter?\nIf you\u2026\nAre unsure about the quality of your USB cable & charger;\nAre looking for safe and faster charging; \nDon\u2019t want to be cheated by those unscrupulous businessmen; \nAre tired with poor quality of charging cables and chargers; \nHave ever been in dilemma of choosing right USB cable/charger; \nAre dealing with USB cables/chargers as a business; \nWanted to have easier and simpler solution to rank the pile of cables/chargers; \nMore...\nThe Features of QooPow\u2122 qualMeter?\nqualMeter is basically made for testing USB charging cables and chargers. It has two major functions:\nCable Test Mode - Simply connect both ends of your USB charging cable with qualMeter and plug it into any 5v USB charging port. You can read the LED indicators to have an idea about the quality of your charging cable.\nCharger Test Mode - Simply plug qualMeter into any 5v USB charging port. You can read the LED indicators to have an idea about the quality of your USB Charger.\nqualMeter has embedded an ultra low power Micro-Processor, a brain, to provide the ability of being smart. Beside its main Cable Test and Charger Test features, it also comes with the following highlighted features:\nCable Shielded Test \u2013 A shielded cable usually has better quality. It\u2019s not only good for charging but also a benefit for data transferring.\n==========\u21ca\u21ca\u21ca New Added Function \u21ca\u21ca\u21ca==========\nCable Short Circuit Test - When you plug qualMeter at Cable Test Mode, the red LED indicator will start flashing If your cable is shorted. You should stop using this cable immediately!\n==========\u21c8\u21c8\u21c8 New Added Function \u21c8\u21c8\u21c8==========\nReversible USB plug \u2013 With the reversible USB plug design, you don\u2019t have to worried about the direction of plugging into a USB charging port. \nPLAY\n\nPlug n Play \u2013 qualMeter comes with no switch or any control button. There is no manual operation needed to be done. It works automatically according to the status it detects.\nHow does QooPow\u2122 qualMeter work?\nqualMeter is designed to provide a simple and straightforward way to test cable and charger without any technical background. That means with qualMeter in hand, everyone is able to distinguish the quality of a cable or a charger.\nSimply connect the cable you are willing to test into corresponding ports as following diagram.\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter has two main testing modes, cable test and charger test. It automatically switches between two modes.\nCharger Test Mode: Without cable plugged in, Charger test mode is enabled right away when qualMeter has been plugged into an USB power source. The orange charger test indicator lights up and it also confirms the testing current is 1A. You can find out the quality of this charger at 1A output by reading the Quality Indicators on the left.\nPLAY\n\nCable Test Mode: Cable test mode will be enabled when both ends of a cable have been connected with qualMeter. Then plug qualMeter into an USB power source. The blue cable test indicator (the left one) will be turned on. You can find out the quality of this cable by reading the Quality Indicators on the left.\nPLAY\n\nShielded Indication: At the Cable Test mode, if the blue Shielded Indicator (the right one) lights up, it means this cable is shielded.\nPLAY\n\n==========\u21ca\u21ca\u21ca New Added Function \u21ca\u21ca\u21ca==========\nCable Short Circuit Test - is as simple as other functions. Just plug both ends of the cable into qualMeter as usual, then plug qualMeter into any 5v USB port. The red LED indicator will start flashing If your cable is shorted. Otherwise, if the cable is not shorted, the qualMeter will automatically start the Cable Test mode to tell you how good is this cable. That\u2019s it ! :)\nPLAY\n\n==========\u21c8\u21c8\u21c8 New Added Function \u21c8\u21c8\u21c8==========\nHow to read the testing results?\nUnlike regular testing devices, there are no numbers bother to read, no buttons, no extra operations, no calculations and no technical background are needed. All you need to know is just colors, the Green, Yellow and Red, which correspond to Good, Fair(OK) and Bad. That\u2019s it! \nYou see colors; you see the quality of your cable and charger.\nQooPow\u2122 qualMeter is suitable for wide range of mainstream cables and is compatible with most of major 5v USB chargers.\nSpecifications\nMain Material\uff1aRaw PCB (CCL FR-4) Pb free\nDimension: 47.8mm x 23.8mm x 11mm (the length of the USB plug is not included)\nPower Input: USB Type A reversible Male Connector\nInput Voltage: 4.5~5.5v\nCable Test Connectors: USB Type A Female Connector, 4 types of mainstream charging connectors such as Micro-USB, Mini-USB and others.\nCharger Test Current: @1A\nLED Indicators: Green x2, Yellow x2, Red x2, Blue x2 and Orange x1  \nThe Rewards for qualMeter\nIf you are interested in getting extra USB charging cables proved by qualMeter, please visit our online shop at www.qoopow.com. Thank You!\nThe Stretch Goals\nThe CAD$50,000 stretch goal (Fulfilled!)\nWe have also come up an idea to develop a more advanced version qualMeter X. It provides more advanced Charger Test function by allowing 1A/1.5A/2A/2.5A/3A output testing and an Output Compensation indicator, which can cover almost all major USB chargers. If you think you\u2019d like to support us to continue on developing the qualMeter X please help us to reach the CAD$50,000 stretch goal. \nThe pledge option for qualMeter X will be available when the CAD$50,000 stretch goal has been reached.\nWE'VE MADE IT! REMARKABLE! \n$50K CAD stretch goal is behind us!\nGet ready to upgrade your qualMeter to qualMeter X?\nHere are the list of the upgrades which will be brought to you with NEW qualMeter X :\nAll functions from qualMeter; \n2x USB Type-C ports are now added (which you are all asking for :)); \nAdvanced Cable Test Mode, @1A/2A; \nAdvanced Charger Test Mode, Full range 1~3.1A (100mA step) Current testing; \nAdjustable Electronic Load;\nOutput Compensation Indication; \n32-bit 48MHz MCU;\nFlash memory for saving the last testing result;\nControl Switch\nFuture Function Extension.\nWe have brought much more than it was expected! \nThe qualMeter X is about 1/3 bigger compare to qualMeter.\nAnd here is the way how we can upgrade your qualMeter to qualMeter X.\nHere is a simple chart to tell you how to upgrade by saving you some time.\nPlease be aware, The upgrade price doesn't apply to the extra qualMeter. If you have pledged extra qualMeter and wanted to upgrade to X version at the same time, you could either drop it to get the Extra qualMeter X reward or jump to the X Angel's Dual Pack.\nHow to use qualMeter X?\nSame as qualMeter, the X version is also simple to use.\nWhen will the qualMeter X be shipped?\nTo be honest, we only have a rough idea for now since qualMeter X wasn't part of our development and production plan at the beginning. The development has just started. We are currently working on the first PCBA layout. The embedded programing, tooling, material and other related sourcing are very different with qualMeter.\nGeneral speaking it will be at least 2 months later after qualMeter has been shipped. However, we are going to try our best to make it happen as fast as we can without compromising the quality. We should have a clear idea on the delivery time for qualMeter X by May.\nThe CAD$80,000 stretch goal\nAs you know qualMeter came from lab usage, it might not look pretty for now. We decided not to put a plastic shell for it to lower down the total cost since the industrial design and plastic molding are expensive. However, we have made efforts to make sure it's durable and safe to use. We do think the style of current looking is raw and tech-ish, kind of nice. :) \nIf you think you'd like to have a plastic shelled version of QooPow\u2122 qualMeter please help us to reach the CAD$80,000 stretch goal. Then we will be able to hire an industrial design team and to make moldings. \nIf you have other ideas, we'd really love to hearing from you!\nWhere are we at in development?\nqualMeter Prototypes, PCBs and some Development Tools\nAt the current point, we have the latest PCB version on hand. Intensive testing is coming to the end, and we are ready to turn it into mass production version. The outline is pretty much firmed though there might be a few slight adjustments to be done on PCB. We are approaching the moment when the capable manufacturer should be involved. We are working with our partners in manufacturing and supply chain and will continue push forward while Kickstarter campaign is going on.\nThe latest qualMeter prototype is ready for mass production.\nThe Schedule\nWho are we?\nIntelliplus is a creative tech start-up formed in 2013, who is focusing on Smart-Ware development. Our vision is to Make Life Easier & Simpler. Currently our main development team is based in Chengdu, China. Chengdu is one of the biggest cities in western china. With her over 2,500 years of historical and humanistic culture, Chengdu is also well known as the cradle of China IT industry. And our manufacturing partners are mainly located in Shenzhen, China, where is the world's IT manufacturing center.\nWe have been contracting and working with one of the top Internet Companies in China and helping them to build fast charging products under their own brand since 2014. By going deeper and gaining more knowledge on the fast charging technologies, we think it\u2019s time to launch our own smart charging products and brand - The QooPow\u2122 series.\nOn our mind, charging is one of the things that should be peaceful and joyful like art. It should be a part of our quality life. Despite there are plenty of charging related products in the market, few of them can stand out. In fact, there are too many low quality and compromised products.People deserve better charging products!\nWe believe we can do better! And here we go.\nBy launching the QooPow\u2122 qualMeter with the excitement, we are proud that we have made it and will continue to do so. Other QooPow\u2122 series smart charging products are in the line of development, more to come.\nThe Core Team\nWhat you can help us? \nOur efforts over the past two years on smart and fast charging technologies have helped to bring qualMeter onto Kickstarter stage where you are connected to participate. A journey we have started to Make Life Easier and Simpler, and to free our mind to make our world a better place! \nqualMeter is our ice breaker to the world. And now, we are heading to mass production and turn our idea into real products! \nThank you!

The CowTech Ciclop is a RepRap 3D scanner with a large scan volume, simple, yet elegant design, and a disruptive price point that blows any other laser scanner out of the water. The user prints the plastic parts on their own printer in any color and resolution they choose, and can assemble the scanner in less than 30 minutes. Then, simply take any object you want to replicate, set it on the 200mm laser cut acrylic turntable, and start scanning. We wanted to make sure our product was usable for anyone who owns a 3D printer, so we meticulously designed  our parts for a print bed volume of only 115mm x 110mm x 65mm (4.5 x 4.3 x 2.6in) so they can be produced on even the smallest of printers. \nLaser scanners are a very common type of 3D scanner that use a pair of line lasers that flash in succession in combination with a camera and a rotating turntable. As the lines flash on the object, they trace the outline of the object in red light. The camera then picks up the location of the laser lines in 3D space, converting those lines into hundreds of thousands of points, and as the turntable rotates, every side of the object is scanned into a cloud of points, which can then be stitched together to form a mesh that replicates the surface of the object with up to 0.5mm precision. \n3D printed model, scanned on the CT Ciclop. Print resolution 0.2mm, PLA, on a Prusa i3 (Horizonal banding due to poor printer quality)\nOverhead view. 0.2mm, PLA, Prusa i3.\nThe CT Ciclop retains a high degree of precision, even after printing on our entry level 3D printer.\n.stl File ready to print in Cura alongside the cross-section of the 3D mesh in CloudCompare\nOur scanner was born out of the BQ Ciclop, an open source scanner using the same design and software as our scanner. We kept all the same basic functionality as the original BQ, but redesigned the scanner from the ground up, making several significant changes and adding many features.\nFirst, we were able to slash prices by designing our own Arduino shield, using a more logical turntable bearing, purchasing our own laser cutter for the acrylic parts, and importing many of our components from reputable manufacturers overseas. We designed our printed parts to use significantly less filament and half the print time of the BQ version. Furthermore, we decreased the minimum bed size of the printer needed to print the parts to a measly 115mm(L) x 110mm(W) x 65mm(H) (4.5in x 4.3in x 2.6in), from a 6x9x3 required on the original. We focused a great deal of energy on aesthetic improvement as well, replacing the ugly and unwieldy threaded rod with sleek laser cut acrylic, adding a magnetic back cover to access the electronics, and an internal LED glow to make the scanner stand out in any environment.\nThe CT Ciclop scanner is a fully open source Rep Rap project, and all details will be released after the campaign is concluded. \nThe term 3D scanner is a bit of a misnomer. Technically, most 3D scanners are actually point cloud generators. The scanner itself is a tool to make a .PLY file, or a point cloud, made up of hundreds of thousands of points that represent the geometry of the object. The typical user will want to convert this point cloud to an .STL file, which can easily be printed on a 3D printer. Once you have a digital 3D file of the part, the possibilities are endless. The CowTech Ciclop uses Horus, software developed by BQ for their version of the scanner. Unfortunately, Horus doesn't support .STL exports at this time, but this feature may be developed in later versions of the program. Fortunately, there are many options for post processing programs that can stitch the point clouds together into a printable file. These include Meshlab, Cloudcompare, Netfabb, Blender, and more. We recommend Meshlab and Cloudcompare, and will provide detailed documentation with the scanner on how to use these programs. \nLimitations\nAll laser scanners can struggle with objects that are very black, very shiny, or furry, as the laser doesn't register properly with the camera. The CowTech Ciclop, like the BQ version, is designed for experienced users who can familiarize themselves with different software programs in order to use the scanner and get high quality outputs from it. \nWe like to think of a 3D scanner like a video camera. A nice camera gives you the tools to take great pictures and videos, but without post production work in a video editing or photo editing program, you will likely be disappointed in the end result. \nYou want a scanner?

While we took different paths in college, life led us both back home to our respective family farms, and we formed a logical partnership, designing products together in the winter time when the farming workload is significantly reduced. We have both been designing logical products for use in farming and ranching our entire lives, and while 3D scanning was a new field for both of us, design and fabrication is certainly not.\nJason Smith received a BA in engineering from Harvard in the spring of 2015. His first foray into entrepreneurship and Kickstarter came when he invented a music responsive LED light show with his roommate in an introductory electrical engineering class. After a summer internship with Salt Lake City based company Power Practical, which has launched 5 successful Kickstarter campaigns totaling over $1.1M, he launched Rayger with his roommate ( www.raygerlights.com), bringing in nearly $25,000, earning a Kickstarter Staff Pick (now \"Project We Love\"), and delivering over 90% of the rewards 2 months ahead of schedule. When he isn\u2019t working on product development, he takes care of 500 black angus cows on his family ranch.

However, the experience of a previous campaign has taught us a lot about many of the issues. By building several working prototypes using sample parts from the same manufacturers we will order our production run from, we are confident in the quality of our components as well as the speed and reliability of our manufacturers. We have even used several of the manufacturers before to provide components for our first campaign.\n \nThe most likely issue we foresee is a delay in shipment. This is an issue that plagues many Kickstarter campaigns, and can be challenging to avoid if even just a few small things go wrong. We have tried to mitigate this issue by doing most of the legwork of part sourcing ahead of time, and listing a realistic delivery date on the rewards rather than an optimistic one.

The quality of the reflection (hologram) is one of the bes,t as the clear panels are made out of the thinnest possible plastic, yet can hold up to 5lb of pressure when fully assembled.\nHolapex LIGHT: This hologram pyramid measures 4 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. The Holapex LIGHT was designed to fit most smartphone/IPhone screen sizes 4\"-6\" inches.When assembled it can take up to 3lbs of pressure.\nHolapex VIVID: The Holapex VIVID was designed to work with tablet/IPads 7\"-12\" inch displays. It measures about 6 inches wide and 3 inches tall. When assembled it can take up to 5lbs of pressure.\nParts: Both Holapex Pyramids come as parts and can easily be assembles. Each pyramid comes with the following parts:\n1 X Matte Black Hat/Cover with model of Pyramid printed in white (VIVID or LIGHT)\n4 X Clear reflectors made out of PET Flexible plastic.\n1 X Matte Black Base/Feet made out of Acrylic.\nAfter producing many prototypes, with different materials, angles, sizes, and colors, we improved every part of the pyramid, provided best angle for best reflection, best color for pyramid, and best materials for each part.\nThe clear panels come with a protective plastic on each side, to protect it from any scratches when shipped. The material used for these panels is a PET Plastic material that is flexible and will not break. The panels are made out of the thinner possible PET plastic to give the best hologram effect with the least to none double blurr reflection.   Each panel comes with male or female connectors, that allow you to easily assemble all 4 sides into the shape of the pyramid. Then easily place the hat over the top of the pyramid and the base on the lower area. Keep in mind, the hat and the base are just optional, and are not needed to use the Hologram properly.\nHow does the Hologram Pyramid work?\nThe pyramid reflects whatever is being displayed on your device, giving it a hologram effect. It's simple technology, but here is a picture to better illustrate how it works.\nCan you use any picture or video with the Holapex Pyramids?\nYes! Although there are hundreds of videos on youtube that you can use with your Holapex pyramid, we decided to make an app for Android and IOS devices!\nThe app is called \"Holapex\" and is ready for download and use! The app allows you to select any videos or pictures from your gallery, and automatically converts it into a 4 sided video or picture, that you can use with your Holapex pyramids!

Now, he's making it his mission to help other parents inspire their kids to get more involved. He says the number one issue is that we don't provide kids with enough context around why they should learn computer science.\n \u201cIt was impossible. I simply could not get the buy-in amongst my kids. They refused to willingly spend time on it no matter how much I incentivized it. It was too intangible for them.\u201d\nAuthor and creator, Franchino is the a real world computer programmer and designer\n\nEventually he discovered the reasons why they were reluctant:\nIt felt like more school work to them. It wasn\u2019t as cool to them as it was to their father\nThe digital natives were more interested in playing traditional video games and sports\nHis kids had no context of why they should spend time studying computer science. The benefits and opportunity were not clear to them\nA programmer, HCI designer and user researcher by trade, Franchino quickly saw the opportunity in this crisis. He began asking other parents what their views were on the matter and found that most parents had similar goals and frustrations, with no solution at hand.\n\u201cThese kids were practically born with iPhones and tablets in their hands.

They take technology for granted.\u201d\nFranchino's three children are digital natives\nFranchino isn\u2019t just talking about learning to code apps either. He\u2019s talking about ECE, an emerging field that bundles electrical engineering, computer sciences, the internet of things and more.\n\u201cToday you can put your skin cells on a chip and analyze them with a Pi. You can remote control a live beetle with diodes and some code. There will be 50 billion IoT objects online by 2020. Even your soccer ball will soon have a MEMS chip and a tiny wifi module that can tell your phone how much force or spin you kicked the ball with. I wan to start educating kids early on about the future of ECE by way of story telling.\u201d\nLast year, Franchino quit his job and developed this graphic novel so he could share his experience and ignite students\u2019 passions for designing and building their own projects. \u201cI began authoring parts of a graphic novel illustrating the life of a young hacker using the likeness of my oldest son, Frankie Jr. I like to think I combined lots of action with real world hacks and technology. Every chip, hardware part, code snippet and brand in the book is real, nothing is masked.\u201d\nFranchino found success in doing this and his kids are now eager to learn on their own and are fascinated with hacking and hardware. \u201cI\u2019ve given the materials to other parents and the results are in, this definitely could work.\u201d\nFranchino and John Richard have been working on The Boy & the Computer since April 2015\n Much progress has already been made!\nThe first draft of the graphic novel was tested amongst a controlled group of 15 students in August of 2015\nOpening scene of the main character, Gou, as he sets his on the Raspberry Pi for the first time.\n\nWorld leaders express their views on why kids should get started earlier.\nPLAY\n\nFranchino explains some of the philosophy behind why he started his company\nFranchino uses inspiration from his personal career to illuminate the politics in the tech and startup industry.\nMany of the characters are real people Franchino has worked with. Practically every cast member will teach you about computer science.\nFranchino has even used his own children as models that represent typical American household behaviors.\nUnlike other tech inspired comic books and graphic novels, The Boy and the Computer does not mask brands or concepts with fake alternatives\n\nEarlier character sheets profiling real world industry professionals, hackers, designers and prodigies to understand their reactions, expressions and thought process. All of these people will come together to teach the reader important lessons, give clues and help the reader memorize important concepts which could make the difference in real life.\n\nHere are some early examples of our sketches:\nHere is Gou, the main character. You can get a sense for his intellectual capacity by the faces he makes and his reactions to people and his environment.\nHere is Gou's father who's been discouraged from the technology industry by local entrepreneurial, disparaging zealots Chad and Deric\nTara is Gou's crush although older and extremely mischevious, she is one of the only characters who is not a hacker or technology industry type\nDr. Winslow is one of Gou's many advisors. Gou meets with Dr. Winslow at the University of Chicago to be inspired\nLadybug is an MIT hardware hacker who plays hard to get with Gou and is reluctant to help him for a variety of reasons.\nThe Rabbi in many cases, helps Gou understand the gravity of many situations and uses analogies from the Torah to guide Gou\nN\u014dn, Gou's brother is an athlete. Each cast member supports Gou in a unique way.\n TSHIRTS!!!!!\nThe Node, a small computer that Gou builds along with the reader, is called the Node.\nWhat's a function?\nHardware hacker\nOur timeline is simple, we don't want to overcomplicate it.

It allows Users that have no knowledge of any Software languages or methods to create sophisticated and complex Programs in a fraction of the time of contemporary methods using only their High School knowledge and problem-solving skills.\nIt took 5 years to find the answer to the long-standing question: \"How do you bring the power of software creation to all educated persons?\" and then 5 years to write the Software \"Code\" with contemporary methods and tools.\nAOS creates a code-less Environment for the User that is based solely on the academics of Information usage that we all learned by the time we left High School. It is based on the foundation of Humankind's knowledge - Algebra, Mathematics and Informational Solutions but extends beyond just numbers as do all Software Development Tools to work on Text, Time, Logic, Pictures, Audios, and Videos (the 7 Universal Data Types).\nAOS creates a bubble around the User/Programmer. Outside of the bubble are horribly complex constructs like the TCPIP Protocol which requires a 3 Volume Set of books to describe how to move Information around the planet. Inside the bubble is the User/Programmer, their Informational need (which never has anything to do with the box), their High School knowledge, and a clear idea of how to work their problem through Mathematics and Grammar.\nThe bubble around the public should have been the first thing accomplished by the original creators of software technology at Bell Laboratories back in the late 70's. The hardware technology could then change anyway it needed without affecting the interface to the public. But it never happened - until now.\nThe toolkit we use to figure out anything Informational (it's all informational) is really, really tiny but powerful beyond words in how we put that simple set together in complex ways.\nAOS is in essence all of the fundamental Information manipulating capabilities that software professional have sitting down to the most prominent tool for making Windows programs. Therefore, there is no piece of Information you cannot work with and no Answer you cannot produce if it's pure Information you are after (vs entertainment or something related to the operation of the computer).\nThe System at present is in Alpha stage.

A BranchLibrary extends the security outward allowing ClientComputers to connect to different branches in TheTree.\nSentience Inc does not support the policy of charging more to businesses just because they have deeper pockets. We do not support the policy of disguising updates as Versions to get more revenue.\nAOS is Licensed to the public for $5/mo per license regardless of business or individual to be affordable to all persons who need assistance with their Informational life. A free version will always be available to the public so that Programs made in AOS can be used by anyone. Customers can license their creations if they so desire because AOS was designed to support User Licensing. This opens the door for the truly great problem-solvers out there to make money with their intellectual abilities.\nFor security, all AOS Licenses are renewed every month. The software makes this transparent to the customer if they so desire without financial info being retained otherwise AOS is renewable with a button click each month. The software monitors the renewal process and completes it.\nSentience Inc needs a small staff of Software Engineers to cleanup and support AOS to bring it to the Licensing stage. AOS will then be ready to assist any organization on a global scale. Mobile usage is incredibly important now with the way most people stay connected. The Applications we make in Windows Desktop need to be usable on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone to be truly available to us as the creators and users.\nA minimum of 3 full time Software Professionals and an office for them to work in for the next year will cover the cleanup of AOS, Licensing startup, and entry into the mobile computing environment.\nThe future of AOS with your gracious help and support:\nadopt Linux, own it, improve it, then marry it with AOS and be the only OS on the machine: ALUX (AOS on Linux)  for $5/mo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest difficulty to producing a powerful and useful software product is not in whether or not you can solve the problem but rather how well will it operate in its environment.\n\nAOS handles everything computer to support the Programmer and therefore represents a significant time-based overhead.

Compounding the problem, many sites refer to older versions of Rust that used different syntax. Instead of wasting time trying to find the information you need in the current syntax wouldn't it be better to have a single source of information on Rust? \nRust is a melting pot for ideas from diverse languages:\nTraits: Very similar to typeclasses in Haskell\nStack and Heap memory allocation: From the land of C/C++\nPattern Matching: Common in functional programming languages\nIterators: Mundane in Object Oriented Programming\nAlgebraic Datatypes: A powerful feature from functional programming\nChannels: A dataflow concept that originated in Communicating Sequential Processes by Tony Hoare\nAdditionally, these topics are unique to Rust:\nDynamically Sized Types (DST)\nTrait Objects\nObject Safety\nClosure/Function Traits\nMultiple Pointer Types (Box, Rc, Arc, Cell...)\nDepending on your background you may have experience with some of these concepts but to be proficient with Rust you need to understand all of them. The official documentation does not explain all of these concepts in detail.\nProposed Contents\nThis book investigates topics that are only briefly introduced in the official documentation\nThe following is a preliminary list of topics I feel are important to understand but are not explained in detail in any single source of information. The basics of the language can be learned from the rust-lang.org site so this information will assume you have read the official documentation but want more.\nThese topics will be covered in detail using code examples and just enough theory so you thoroughly understand them.\nTraits and Multidispatch\nDynamically Sized Types (DST)\nTrait Objects\nObject Safety\nAssociated Types\nAlgebraic Datatypes ('struct' and 'enum' types)\nOwnership, Borrowing and Lifetimes\nHigher-Ranked Lifetimes\nPattern Matching ('match' keyword)\nStack/Heap Memory\nPointers\nUnboxed Closures and Function Traits\nBackers will have access to draft chapters.\nTarget Audience\nThis book is intended for those who already have experience in at least one programming language and have read through the documentation on the Rust website.\nDepending on your experience, some topics may cover information you already know or be completely new to you.\nYour background can be in C/C++ or Java/C# or Python/Javascript or Haskell/Scala... it doesn't matter as long as you already understand how to program.\nWhy Am I the Right Person to Write this Book?\nMany of the features found in Rust are also found in other programming languages that I have already learned.\nMy desire to learn new things has pushed me into languages such as Haskell, ML, Lisp, Eiffel, Mozart, Prolog, Java, C, C#, Lua, Python, PHP and now Rust. I understand various programming paradigms like OOP, dataflow, reactive, functional and logic. Using knowledge from all of these areas I will be able to explain how these concepts relate to Rust so you too will understand them.\nPrevious Publishing Experience\nIn October of 2013, I ran a successful Kickstarter project for a book called \"Dataflow and Reactive Programming Systems\". It was delivered on time in April of 2014.\nSince then I have been selling the book on Amazon, LeanPub and my own website (deepFriedCode.com).\nRecently some readers commented on Hacker News...\nMatt Carkci's book discusses the different closely related topics of data flow, flow based programming and reactive programming, very clearly and in quite some detail ...

How good is your memory?\nIf you are like most people, you probably have difficulty remembering what you had for lunch yesterday! When you have many different, extremely complex passwords how can you remember even just one of them, let alone all of them?\n Take this one for instance: xXkleG!8+Ke$?mcd\nIt's a great password, but will you be able to remember it?\nAnd, you need dozens more just like that one - all different.\nEnter Enigmaze - a secure password manager logbook that enables you to quickly create passwords that are almost impossible to guess, yet easy to find and use when you need to log in to your online accounts.\nEnigmaze comes in a classic gift box, so it's a great present for your geek friends.\nWhy do we call it Enigmaze?\nEnigma comes from the second World War where there was a gadget called the Enigma Machine. The Enigma Machine was invented by a German, Arthur Scherbius to encode messages sent by wire so that if intercepted, the messages would be unreadable. Basically it was a method of creating a coded message that looked like nonsense to anyone other than the recipient.\nCreating passwords that are difficult to crack is not difficult, but remembering them is.  \n\nEnigmaze to the rescue!\nKeep your password secure in your wallet or share it with a client\n\n\nYou can use a variety of encryption methods, such as a UV invisible ink pen, transparent overlay cards, your own custom method, or much more. The choice is yours!\nThe Enigmaze notebook gives you:  \n- Hardcover stitched binding\n- Pocket size A6 (94 x 143mm / 4\"x5.7\" exterior) \n- 88 sheets of acid free ink-proof 70 g/m2\n- Different grid for every sheet.\n- Alphabetical tabs (3 pages per letter) for organizing and storing you passwords. \n- 10 empty sheets for taking notes at the end of the book\n- Plenty of space for web addresses, usernames (yes, we forget those, too!), and passwords.   \n- A light weight, sturdy construction that is ideal for carrying in your pocket, handbag, or backpack. \n- An elastic closure and an expandable inner pocket.   \n- Invisible ink marker with UV light (may not be as shown)\n- Frosted, grid printed PVC card.\n\n\n With Enigmaze, you will never, ever, forget a password again! \n\nEarly prototype under UV light\nHow to use Enigmaze:\n\nThere are many ways to use your Enigmaze password logbook, and your methods are completely up to you. You can even vary your methods for different websites creating impossible to crack passwords, even if somebody else has your Enigmaze.\nFor example, one method is drawing a line on the grid with a UV pen. \nThe line can be straight, or parts can be drawn at different angles. Alternatively, using the outer letters and numbers for navigation, you can highlight individual characters on the line. Your password can be any length you wish, but anything less than eight characters is not recommended.\n\nUsing an erasable ink pen to change your password often.\nPLAY\n\nThe alphabetical index enables you to find your password quickly, for example you would go to 'G' for Google, or Godaddy. \n\n\nYou can have lots of fun just thinking up new methods while at the same time creating passwords that are almost impossible to crack!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe learned a lot from our previous projects and we are confident we can deliver a high quality product, on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 314, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/programming/enigmaze-secure-password-manager", "project_name": "Enigmaze - Secure Internet Password Log Book"}}, {"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "C.H.I.P. is a computer.

The course \u2018Learn Node.js By Building 10 Projects\u2019 won accolades for being resourceful from learning enthusiasts, Kickstarter Backers and other students who are learning it.\nSo, following the successful launch and delivery of our Node.js course, we are glad to announce yet another project on Kickstarter, it\u2019s a complete course to learn a very useful technology Angular.JS.\n\nAngular.JS is one of the latest and most useful technologies around, which is why we have decided to make yet another landmark project based course on Angular.JS. \nWhat is Angular JS?\nAngular.JS is an open source web application framework maintained by Google.\n\nIt is a robust client-side technology for building modern web applications using model-view controller (MVC) software architecture. Angular.JS adds more functionality and features to a single-page HTML web application. Today, a lot of developers rely heavily on the MEAN stack (Mongo.DB, Express.JS, Angular.JS and Node.JS) and learning Angular.JS is surely a fruitful investment. \n\nAngular.JS offers a bunch of interesting features, such as asynchronous dependency injection, deep link routing, form validation, two-way data binding and deep linking, to name a few.\n\nSome of the popular applications built using Angular.JS:\n\nDematerializer (a blogging platform) \nPunchPlay (music player application)  \nSendmachine (an email marketing tool)  \nBetrend (a fashion portal)  \nSo, what makes Angular.JS a preferred choice for designing web applications? Let us take a look at some of its prominent features.\nAngular.JS uses directives to add new mark-ups to HTML and turns static HTML files in to something dynamic. It is an innovative approach to incorporating HTML and developing big web applications.  \nAngular.JS organizes views, controllers, directives, filters and such other elements in to separate modules. This division becomes convenient for building and managing an application.  \nAngular.JS has a built-in dependency injection system and is unit-testable.  \nAngular.JS uses data-binding directives to provide a projection of the model to the application view. It automates synchronization of data between model and view components. This allows developers to avoid writing a considerable amount of boilerplate code.\nAngular.JS has a built-in template engine consisting of plain HTML pages (views) as well as controllers written in JavaScript to build rich user interfaces.  \nAngular.JS uses directives to extend HTML dialect by creating new HTML elements and attributes as well as custom HTML tags that work as new widgets.\nAbout the Project \nProject in Angular.Js \u2013 Learn Angular.Js by Building 10 Projects .\nIn this course we will create 10 different projects implementing Angular along with some other technologies\n\u2022 HTML5 / CSS3\n\u2022 JQuery\n\u2022 NodeJS / NPM / Node Modules\n\u2022 Bootstrap\n\u2022 Foundation\n\u2022 Facebook API\n\u2022 Instagram API\n\u2022 Socket.io\n\u2022 MongoDB\nProjects we will be covering in this course are\u2026\nProject 1 \u2013 Basic Angular Website: A simple website using dynamic functionality from AngularJS\nProject 2 \u2013 myContacts Address Book: Small app to manage contacts\nProject 3 \u2013 Web Template Store: Application that displays web templates for sale\nProject 4 \u2013 Web Sockets Chat App: Real time chat using web sockets\nProject 5 \u2013 Angular Facebook App: Facebook authentication and posting app\nProject 6 \u2013 Knowledgebase: Article database using MongoDB\nProject 7 \u2013 User Login App: Custom user authentication app\nProject 8 \u2013 Instagram Gallery: Display images from Instagram\nProject 9 \u2013 Job Directory: Small job listing site\nProject 10 \u2013 Concert Finder: Concert/music directory\nImportance for developers:\nToday, Angular.JS has a pretty vast scope for mainly two reasons. Firstly, it is maintained and promoted by Google. Secondly, a large community of developers are making valuable contributions by introducing newer features and functionalities to this technology. There is also much scope for experimenting with Angular.JS to test its significance in diverse applications.\nYoutube\u2019s Leanback on PlayStation as well as DoubleClick are already helping Angular.JS to spread like fire. It is a matter of time that Angular.JS will capture the technology market by attracting large-scale companies, start-ups, developers and business owners. So, grab this opportunity to join our latest Angula.JS course and become an industry expert today.\nBack this Project to get the early access to the \"Projects in Angular.JS\" course before everyone else. All the students will get the course access on udemy.com platform after its launch by 20th June 2015.

Beautiful and fun at the same time, the clock uses the famous Fibonacci sequence to display time in a brand new way.\nThe Fibonacci Clock has been designed for curious and inventive people who like a time piece that keeps them on their toes. \nIn the news ...\nThe Fibonacci Clock In The News\nGizmodo - \"A Fibonacci Clock Is Hands-Down The Nerdiest Timepiece\"\nThe Guardian - \"world's most stylish nerd timepiece\"\nHackaday.com - \"the best looking clock we\u2019ve ever featured\"\nMirror UK - \"Are you clever enough to tell the time on the world's most complicated clock?\"\nWoodworking For Mere Mortal - \"The Fibonacci Clock is just so cool\"\nNat Corbeil - \"Un Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois cr\u00e9e le buzz sur le web\"\nDigital Trends - \"This Fibonacci clock forces you to do math to tell the time\"\nHow do I tell time on the Fibonacci Clock?\nThe Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers created by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the 13th century. This is a sequence starting with 1 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. For the clock I used the first 5 terms: 1, 1, 2, 3 and 5.   \nThe screen of the clock is made up of five squares whose side lengths match the first five Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3 and 5. The hours are displayed using red and the minutes using green. When a square is used to display both the hours and minutes it turns blue. White squares are ignored. \nTo tell time on the Fibonacci clock you need to do some math. To read the hour, simply add up the corresponding values of the red and blue squares. To read the minutes, do the same with the green and blue squares. The minutes are displayed in 5 minute increments (0 to 12) so you have to multiply your result by 5 to get the actual number. \nOften, there are multiple ways to display a single time. To add to the challenge, the combinations are picked randomly from all the different ways a number can be displayed. There are, for example, 16 different ways to display 6:30 and you never know which one the clock will use!\nMake it a lamp...\nPress the mode button on the back of the clock and it will turn into a modern version of the lava lamp. Two different lamp modes are included with the clock, but you can hack the clock and make your own. The possibilities are limitless.\nPLAY\n\nHack it, it's open!\nThe Fibonacci clock is driven by an Atmega328 micro-controller running Arduino. That means you can change the code running in the clock using the official Arduino IDE. The possibilities are as infinite as the Fibonacci sequence! I can't wait to see what you will come up with.\nTo make it easy to hack, I have included an FTDI connector so that you don't have to remove the chip to reprogram it. On top of that, a yellow LED has been connected to pin #13 to help you debug your application.\nThe Fibonacci Clock is an open source / hardware project. Once all the rewards are shipped I'll publish all the sources and the schematics on my website under the GPL license.\nThe making of\nThe following video is a time-lapse of the construction of the latest prototype I built.\nI had to build many prototypes before I was satisfied with the result. \nRewards\nWhy I need your help\nElectronics projects tend to be much cheaper when mass produced.

How refreshing to hear such a brave opinion after almost a decade of MVC-domitaion. \nPLAY\n\nAnyway, I really suck at Angular. \nIt's just weird to me to use directives in HTML. \nIt's almost like using HTML to code JavaScript. \nI never got used to it. At the same time, I keep hearing good things about React.\nThat's why I had this idea of learning myself and teaching you React.js (with this course). \nI used the same approach 4 years ago when I wrote my first book on Node.js. \nIt became Amazon #1 Best Seller in the Client-Server category and helped a few thousand engineers.\n7 Ways To ROCK With React.js\nReact.js is a JavaScript library. \nIt's used for creating user interfaces (UIs). \nIt's created and used by giants such as Facebook and Instagram. \nMillions of people use apps built on React.js. \nThink of React.js as the View in Model, View, Controller.\nThe difference between Backbone.js, Angular.js and React.js is that React.js creates its own virtual DOM (Document Object Model) for pages' components. \nYou work with them, not the DOM. \nThis provides tremendous flexibility and awesome performance,\nbecause React.js knows the needed changes beforehand and updates the DOM tree accordingly. \nThis allows to avoid unnecessary DOM operations and makes updates more effective.\nHere are some of other advantages of React.js:\nDecoupling\nIncreased cohesion using a component model \nAbstraction, \nComposition\nExpressivity \nVirtual DOM & Synthetic events (which basically means they completely re-implemented the DOM and its event system) \nEnables modern HTML5 event stuff on IE 8 Server-side rendering Testability Bindings to SVG, VML, and <canvas>\nOnly Wise People Can Qualify\nSmart people learn on their mistakes while wise learn on mistakes of others. Save time with this course...\nI published nine books on JavaScript and Node.js that have been downloaded or bought by over 10,000 developers. \nIn addition to that, I have experience in online courses. \nThree of my courses have over 2,000 students enrolled. \nThe #2 course on Node on Udemy\nI'm not bragging. \nI'm only making a point that I am capable of delivery once the demand is proven by the campaign. :-)\nI worked with Backbone.js before. I'm not an expert on React.js. I haven't build anything production-ready with it (yet). \nThis will give me the advantage of a beginner's mind. \nThat is I won't have the knowledge curse and will be able to explain everything in the layman's terms.\nJoin me on this journey and learn React.js by backing this campaign with $50. \nHigh Performance JavaScript Without The Headache\u2014Limited Time Offer\nThe course will have at least 1 hour of HD video, and examples on the following topics:\nReact custom components\nCommunication between React components\nIntegration of React with jQuery UI / Bootstrap components\nReact Router and routing in React \nRendering React on the server\nReact and server / mBaaS\nThere are four options:\n$197\n$47\n$12\n$7\nFund $197, and you'll get my other online courses (same as with $47 pledge) plus a two-hour Skype session with me where we can pair program, or just talk.\nThe $47 will get you the life-time access to the React.js course \n+ 5 ebooks (Rapid Prototyping with JS, Express.js Guide, Intro to OAuth with Node, JS FUNdamentals) \n+ life-time access to Node Program online course\n+ life-time access to Mongoose online course\nHowever, for only $12, you'll get the life-time access to the React.js course\n+ 5 ebooks (Rapid Prototyping with JS, Express.js Guide, Intro to OAuth with Node, JS FUNdamentals)\nLast but not least, the $7 backing will get you the life-time access to the React.js course itself.\nPick your option and back the campaign before it's over... \nor before the limit of backers is reached. \nThe campaign is ending in a few days!\n---\nCheers,\nAzat Mardan\nPS: React.js is hot, hot, hot.

We love 3D printing and all the doors it opens, but we don\u2019t like our printers. It seems like every day something jams, breaks, shifts, or fails. Even when our printers do work, they need fine-tuning to print well. All in all, we probably spend more time working on our printers than on our inventions.\nSure, there are some high-end machines out there that consistently work well\u2014but why do they have to be so expensive?\nGo into a store with $179 and see what you can get. A microwave, a mini-fridge, a vacuum, etc. All of these products are pretty complicated, and no one expects them to require fixing every week. We believe a 3D printer shouldn't be any different.\nThat\u2019s why we designed Tiko.\nTiko is a 3D printer unlike any before it. We meticulously designed every piece of it to make it high quality and easy to use, while keeping costs down in order to achieve a great price. So, what makes Tiko different?\nMost 3D printers have a multipart frame. These are bulky, difficult to assemble, and easily damaged. This is where Tiko is fundamentally different. Tiko is unibody. That means the whole frame is one piece, introducing an amazing array of benefits. Easy to manufacture. Virtually impossible to misalign. That's how you get a quality 3D printer for $179.\nTiko is a delta 3D printer with three sets of arms moving in unison to control the movement of the print head (more on this later). The essence of Tiko\u2019s innovation is our discovery that delta is the ideal configuration to unlock the many benefits of unibody.\nFrom the very beginning, we were determined to make an accurate printer. Tiko\u2019s unibody construction and delta mechanism have been carefully designed to deliver exceptionally high mechanical repeatability without the need for high-precision components. That\u2019s right, you heard us. Even without high-precision components, Tiko is still able to print incredibly consistent layers. \nTiko printed the vase pictured above at a 200 micron-resolution, but it can print as fine as 50 microns.\nThanks to unibody, Tiko is also enclosed. Whereas most 3D printers have problems with warping prints, Tiko\u2019s enclosed print chamber means that prints are isolated from the outside environment, resulting in strong and consistent print results, even when the wind blows.\nTiko\u2019s slender unibody frame, delta mechanism, and ultra-compact liquefier/end-effector enable it to print objects far larger than any similarly sized 3D printer.\nLike most delta printers, we started with a circular print volume. But we wanted more than that, so we expanded Tiko\u2019s print volume into the corners for those extra-long prints, maximizing space efficiency.\nNot only can you print large objects, you can actually remove them easily, too. Tiko\u2019s print bed is flexible, so once your print is done, you simply lift the printer off the bed, then twist to pop off your print. \nAnd with the specially-formulated coating on Tiko's print bed, prints adhere consistently. No more scraping, no blue painter\u2019s tape, and no glue stick shenanigans either.\nYou know what else is flexible? Your choice of filament. Tiko uses non-proprietary 1.75mm filament on a standard 1kg 165mm (6.5 in.) diameter spool, so you can experiment with different materials. Tiko also detects when you\u2019re out of filament and pauses the print so you can reload and resume. \nWires are so 1996. Connect Tiko to the cloud, and you can print from almost anywhere, even from your smartphone. No Wi-Fi? Tiko makes its own wireless access point so you can print directly, too.  \nTiko\u2019s browser-based software is super user-friendly. We\u2019ve already optimized Tiko\u2019s performance, leaving only a few straightforward settings so you can spend more time on your ideas and leave the printing to Tiko.\nTiko\u2019s enclosed build chamber also means children and pets can\u2019t interfere with the liquefier, a small but dangerously hot component that is typically left exposed in other 3D printers. Taking things a step further, Tiko has an onboard accelerometer that automatically shuts the printer down if it\u2019s disturbed.\nThis same accelerometer is used for auto calibration, plus something even cooler. Tiko can measure its own performance, so with your permission, we can use performance data from your printer to help make every Tiko better. This will help us improve our firmware and slicing engine AND keep your Tiko running at peak performance. Everybody wins!\nTiko\u2019s unibody construction also makes it incredibly strong. The stiffness of the frame improves print quality while making Tiko durable and easy to ship.\nBut even with all that strength, unibody makes Tiko surprisingly lightweight.\nBy now you might be wondering: How can a 3D printer this good, with all these features, cost so little? Well, it wasn\u2019t easy. But if you\u2019re not afraid to geek out, neither are we...\nYou emailed us, you asked us technical questions, and we\u2019re happy to deliver. Right off the bat, there are a few things you should know:\n1) Tiko has almost no parts in common with any other 3D printer in the world. Period. With a few exceptions, every component inside Tiko is a bespoke part designed for rapid and inexpensive manufacture.\n2) Every component you see below is a generation or two behind where we actually are. We are in a highly competitive field with rampant product-cloning, so we hold our intellectual property very close to the vest, and a number of these technologies are patent-pending. These older parts worked well, and they\u2019re similar to what\u2019s in the final Tiko, but the latest generation is even better. And secret!\nNow let's get technical...\nONCE AGAIN, UNIBODY\nIt all started with unibody. In most 3D printers, the most expensive (by far) item is the frame. That\u2019s because most 3D printers have a frame built from multiple beams that are fastened together. In delta printers, this frame is often made from three vertical extruded-aluminum beams. We had a simple thought\u2026 what if we extruded all three rails together?\nJust like that, we had it. A unibody chassis. Strong, lightweight, virtually impossible to misalign, but also one we could extrude by the mile at a very low cost. Being made of one piece means no assembly is needed\u2014no fasteners, no alignments, none of that.\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, but an enormous leap forward. And it's only the beginning.\nDELTA\nDeltas really do it better. We don\u2019t want to lecture you on robot kinematics, but it\u2019s no secret that parallel manipulators are inherently more accurate than their gantry/serial counterparts. We\u2019ve said it twice, and we\u2019re proud to say it again. Tiko does not use high-precision mechanical components. Why not?\nBecause we don\u2019t need to! Tiko\u2019s low-part-count parallel-arm mechanism has consistently demonstrated exceptional mechanical repeatability without the use of high-precision rails and linear bearings. That means we can manufacture Tiko using consumer-grade tolerances and relatively simple parts, rather than the crazy-expensive CNC-machine components found in other 3D printers.\nDIRECT-DRIVE SYSTEM\nHaving developed an inexpensive chassis and rails, we didn't want to mess it up with a complicated drive system. Most 3D printers use an eye-popping arrangement of belts, pulleys, and tensioners. Instead, we developed a proprietary direct-drive system in which the motors are mounted onto carriages that drive themselves directly along the rails.\n\nSimple, reliable, and super-inexpensive to make. How we integrated the gear racks into the rails during production, however, is our secret. \nNOTE: Don't worry, we abandoned the above pictured NEMA-14\u2019s ages ago. They were expensive, heavy, and noisy. Tiko now uses a completely different type of motor that has proven far more suitable, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how little it costs. This alone had a major impact on our pricing.\nCUSTOM ELECTRONICS\nOnce we had perfected Tiko\u2019s mechanics, the electronics became the most expensive part of the printer. Most 3D printers use hobbyist electronics, which are great for tinkering but overpriced and underpowered for a consumer-grade product. So, we developed our own.\nTiko\u2019s electronics employ carefully chosen surface-mount components that are optimized for mass manufacture. These make Tiko faster and smarter, while costing less.\nFurthermore, Tiko\u2019s high-efficiency liquefier and motors use only a fraction of the energy required by most 3D printers. This allowed us to use smaller and less expensive electronic components and a standard \u201cbrick\u201d power adapter instead of a bulky PSU, which further reduced costs.\nPASSIVE-COOLED LIQUEFIER\nLastly, there is Tiko\u2019s liquefier assembly. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the only liquefier in the world that can extrude PLA without active cooling\u2014and in an enclosed space at that.\n\nWe spent close to a year getting it right. Why did we bother? Because cooling fans are expensive. Aside from the fan itself, you need a finned heatsink, the wiring to the PCB, the PWM output to drive it, and the added assembly steps to install and wire it in. There\u2019s also the noise, the size (which would compromise print volume) and the problem of dust collecting in the fan/heatsink.\n\nTiko\u2019s one-of-a-kind passive cooled liquefier solves all of these problems, and it's compact, energy efficient, and inexpensive to manufacture.\nAt its core are the carefully designed convection-optimizing heat vents. These vents maximize the upward flow of hot air while shielding the heatsink. The exact specifications are secret, but Tiko's liquefier maintains a remarkably low inlet temperature without any forced airflow\u2014even inside a warm print chamber.\n\nBy incorporating the heat shield into an injection-moldable end effector with integrated ball joints and making a geometrically simple heatsink without any fins, we dropped costs even further.\nTITANIUM NOZZLE\nAchieving our demanding thermal performance criteria also required the use of a one-of-a-kind aerospace-grade Titanium alloy nozzle. The nozzle minimizes conduction to the heatsink without the need for an insulating barrel. The reduced heat flux results in a nozzle that requires very little energy to maintain its temperature, making it exceptionally energy efficient.\nNotice how quickly the temperature drops off. We freakin' LOVE Titanium!\nThis unique nozzle makes for an extremely compact and efficient liquefier, which gives Tiko excellent extrusion control while enabling trouble-free nozzle changing, as no molten filament ever comes into contact with the threads. It also improves print quality by minimizing the effects of radial disturbances in the carriage. \nBut isn't Titanium expensive? Sure it is, but by making the components so small, it actually reduced our costs.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nTiko\u2019s cutting-edge technologies and bespoke parts give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. It wasn't easy, but we did it, and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring Tiko to you.\nNow for $179, you can have a Tiko. What you create with it is up to you.\nAnd first movers can get a Tiko at our limited Earliest Bird ($99) and Early Bird ($139) prices.\nIf you want multiple Tikos\u2014for your whole family or a school or to simply print more things at the same time\u2014multiply $179 by the number you want and set that as your pledge amount (Example: 3 x $179 = $537 for three Tikos). \nNOTE: Multi-Tiko pledges will only be counted in multiples of $179. Earliest/Early Bird prices are limited to one-per-backer.\nOne of the questions we get asked most is, \u201cCan you use your 3D printer to print another 3D printer?\" Well, kind of! For an $18 pledge, you can get a 1/10th scale Baby Tiko Unibody\u2026 that was printed by a Tiko!\nAnd for any pledge amount, you'll be helping make 3D printing accessible and dependable for a new population of inventors who haven't had easy access before now. We'll keep you informed of our progress through consistent campaign updates, and over time we'll share creations from around the world that came to life thanks to your support. \nFULFILLMENT\nWe\u2019ve been working on Tiko for over a year. During that time, we\u2019ve gone through many iterations, developed some remarkable technologies, and created a strong network of manufacturers to form a solid supply chain. With your help, we can initiate the following steps to bring Tiko to you\u2026\nSHIPPING\nIn order to make sure that all backer information is up-to-date so we can ensure fair rates, we will collect shipping fees when we send backer surveys this Fall. Exact shipping rates will vary depending on destination, but will not exceed $65 USD per Tiko.\nTiko rewards will be shipped according to Kickstarter pledge order, starting this November. If you want your Tiko soon, you should move fast!\nWhat is it about us that makes us so different? How were we able to build Tiko, and why are we the ones to deliver? Let\u2019s get better acquainted.\nMatt Gajkowski (Center)\nMatt was born and raised to be an entrepeneur. He believes in simplicity and relentless progress, and he isn't afraid to challenge established ideas. He is the mind behind Tiko's groundbreaking technologies and the muscle that has brought them to market. Matt worked as a freelance product designer before starting Tiko. He now has a vision for the future of 3D printing and the know-how to realize it.\nSharon Charitar (Left)\nSharon gets things done. She handles Tiko's market research, community management, PR, bookkeeping, etc. You name it, she's done it, expertly. An analyst at heart, Sharon finds data that we use to improve our business and our product. She is the glue that holds all of Tiko's operations together and keeps us running smoothly and efficiently.\nMichael Zhang (Right)\nMichael was born in China and moved to Canada at age 12. He is fluent in Mandarin and has many connections back home. Michael leverages this, along with his sharp technical skill set, to work with experienced manufacturers without language or technical barriers. This enabled us to find new ways to manufacture Tiko's bespoke parts and push the envelope on Tiko's performance while reducing manufacturing costs.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to bring Tiko to this stage, but we couldn\u2019t have done it alone. It was through the patience, support, and enthusiasm of some amazing partners that we\u2019ve made it this far.\nSpark Centre is a non-profit support organization that helps entrepreneurs bring innovative technologies to market. A passionate team, they have supported us since day one. They are the minds behind the $25,000 Ignite competition and the Thrive accelerator program. Before we met Spark, our prototype was held together with tape and popsicle sticks. If you have an idea, talk to them!\nFallon StarterKit takes the same top creative talent that works on Fallon\u2019s high-profile ad campaigns and lets them create crowdfunding campaigns for select projects. Boy are we glad they selected us! This campaign is the result of our extraordinary partnership with Fallon.\nThere are numerous other amazing companies we\u2019ve worked with for manufacturing, legal, accounting, etc. Building a printer is one thing, building a company is another, and it\u2019s because of their hard work that Tiko is ready for you.\nTiko has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With Tiko, we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \n\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tiko is only as good as its parts, and up until now, all of those parts have been prototyped using 3D printing and machining. In production, our parts will be made using injection molding and other processes, which means they'll have different tolerances and mechanical properties than those we\u2019ve prototyped. If any of these changes compromises performance, we will have to go back and tool them again. This is not a fast process.\n\nFurthermore, we will not release a printer that doesn't meet our high standards, so we'll run endurance tests on every single aspect of Tiko until it's ready. This too, takes time.

To design one, our team of engineers and designers developed groundbreaking ways to reduce manufacturing costs, increase ease of use, and maintain high quality performance. So here it is: the 3D printer everybody across the globe has been waiting for!\nThe Genesis Uno and Duo make printing on the go a breeze. They have a unique space-maximizing and user-friendly design that allow you to comfortably and efficiently print all of your 3D projects without sacrificing quality. The Genesis DUO takes it further by doubling your print options in terms of colors and materials.\nAs well as a large print volume, the Genesis Uno and Duo offer many more additional features that make these printers stand out in the 3D market:\nFull sized LCD: Control and monitor your printing progress right at your Genesis printer\nSD support: Start untethered printing right from your Genesis\nWireless connectivity: Control your Genesis via PC, tablet, or smartphone  \nAuto-Calibration: Drastically reduce the time spent on calibration \nBlazing print speeds: Print your prototypes at up to 150 mm/s\nWith standard print volumes and the fastest print speeds in their price range, the Genesis Uno and Duo truly set the bar high. Their compact, user-friendly design incorporates extra features that enhance the printing process and the quality of their outputs without added manufacturing costs or bulk.\nTo make this amazing 3D printer, we first had to address the technical and design issues that were behind the high cost and inconsistent quality of other 3D printers on the market. We found that many of the Cartesian, square-shaped, and Delta 3D printers made inefficient use of structural materials and space.\nOur patent-pending design, which exploits material strength and the rigidity of a properly mounted axis, keeps production cost low by removing nearly half the structural volume of existing machines and decreasing by 50% the amount of needed components, while continuing to allow for a large build volume of up to 1 cubic foot. Every component of the Genesis 3D printer is designed with multi-functionality in mind to reduce manufacturing cost of redundant components. In addition, all electronics are housed together to further lower the time and cost needed for cable management.\nOur cantilever design eliminates bend or misalignment, and allows the Genesis 3D printer to withstand any rapid print movement or handling.\nThe Genesis 3D printer also offers an unmatched modular design which allows you to easily upgrade printer parts so that your Genesis 3D printer can remain on par with the best consumer 3D printers on the market.\nDual-Extruders\nDual-extruder printers in the present market perform at slow print speed due to bulky motors on the axis. In order to address this problem, we incorporated a lightweight, well-tuned Bowden system that allows incredibly fast print speeds of up to 150mm/s and a resolution quality of up to 50 microns.\nAuto-Calibration\nAdditionally, we included an auto-calibration sensor that allows consistent adherence of the first print layer, the most critical step in any 3D printing process. Genesis\u2019 autonomous calibration system along with other key features keeps it ready to print at all times.\nLCD and Wireless Connectivity\nPrint on the go with an SD card and monitor your print status right on the LCD screen. Control your Genesis 3D printer from your smartphone, tablet or PC via Wi-Fi or USB to keep your desk or work area clutter-free.\nTechnical Specifications\nKickstarter Reward Offers\nBecome familiar with the different options the Genesis 3D printer offers . with the graphic below. \nComparison\nProduction Timeline\nOur machine is fully functional as demonstrated in our video.

Thank you!\nThe next thought that struck me was, \"Do I need another stretch goal for the final hours of the campaign?\" In my discussions about Madeup with folks in the computer science community, I have become aware of the importance of a block-based interface (like Scratch and AppInventor and many others). I contemplated adding a stretch goal to implement a blocks interface, but I had to admit I intend to add this whether or not I meet a stretch goal. I felt it disingenuous to announce it as a stretch goal when I plan on implementing it anyway. Of course, if you would still like to contribute, I welcome your support.\nStretching\nThanks to the generosity of 50 backers, we have reached our initial $2500 fundraising goal. Since there's some time left on the clock, I asked the backers if we should pursue a further goal. The most requested stretch goal is a desktop version of Madeup. What were their reasons?\nAn Internet connection would not be necessary.\nIndividuals would not need to be concerned about accounts and privacy issues.\nSo, if we can reach $4000 by the end of the campaign, I will work on a desktop Madeup client to be released during summer 2016. Work on this will not precede our initial goal of getting the web client released in early 2016.\nWhat is Madeup?\nMadeup is a programming language for making things up. Its speakers navigate 3-D space to generate printable shapes. The language is designed to teach computation from a tangible, first-person perspective and to help students integrate technology back into the non-virtual world. The models that we build in Madeup can be sent directly to a 3-D printer.\nThe Madeup language is a fully-featured programming language, supporting both imperative and functional styles of programming. It supports the following:\nmathematical operators\nconditional statements\nloops\narrays\nboolean logic\nvariables\nfunctions\nrecursion\nhigher-order functions\npartial function application (in progress)\nAs Madeup users write code to wander through space, they think about the structure of shapes, how we use mathematics to model the world, symbolic thinking, and sequential and diverging processes. Students who use Madeup learn as much about computer programming as they do mathematics, design, and logic. And they do so in a spatial context, which allows them to leverage a great wealth of their own prior knowledge. All this, plus the output can be held in one's hand!\nTODO\nWe have developed Madeup in our free time for the past year and a half. It is still in alpha stage. We are hoping to raise enough funds to clean up its rough edges and make it freely available to the general public. In particular, we want to use it in summer camps, introductory programming classes, professional development for K-12 teachers, and outreach events.\nMadeup is almost ready to be shared with others, but some work remains. With your support, we will complete the following tasks before making it publicly available:\nBug fixes (mysterious orientation flips, awkward joints, improperly handled concavities, etc.)\nDocumentation\nLesson plans\nSpeed-ups (metaball generation, mesh generation)\nImproved user interface\nAccount system\nMuch of the work will take place in summer 2015, when we are not as busy at our full-time university teaching jobs.\nExamples\nA traffic cone made of two simple tubes.\nA worm composed of spheres on a sine wave.\nA helix generated with a tube command.\nA star extruded into a solid.\nA vase generated by revolving its cross-section around the y-axis.\nA ripple generated as a two-dimensional parametric surface.\nWill it work?\nWe have already used Madeup in a few public workshops at our library and local schools. Our favorite feedback from these early tests was from a young woman just starting middle school: \"How do I build a sphere?\" The participants have been excited to make things.\nModels built by middle schoolers using Madeup at a workshop held in the L.E. Phillips Memorial Public Library in Eau Claire, WI.\nRewards\n$10 or more: your name goes on the Madeup Slab of Thanks, a 3-D model of the names of all our gracious supporters.\n$25 or more: a Madeup sticker is sent to you in the mail, along with a hearty expression of our thanks.\n$50 or more: you are given early access to Madeup and its documentation. You'll be able to create your own models!\n$75 or more: a 3-D printed ceramic rupee designed in Madeup is sent to you in the mail.\nYour generosity pays--in foreign currency.\n$100 or more: a 3-D printed ceramic trivet composed of interlocking spirals and designed in Madeup is sent to you in the mail.\nThese interlocking spirals are so powerful, they won't let your table won't get scorched by hot pots and pans that you set on them!\n$250 or more: a 3-D printed initials keychain is sent to you in the mail. We will generate a contour surface around the intersection of your three initials and then print it. See an interactive demo.\nIs it a C? Is it an R? Is it a J?

Most importantly, it is really fun to play whether you are a musician or you just want to make some noise.\nCapabilities\nSynthino XM is a polyphonic, multitimbral synthesizer with many features:\n5-note polyphony for superb playability\n12 waveforms, 5 drum samples (kick, snare, hi-hat, tom, clap), and noise generator\n12-bit audio at 25KHz output rate\n4 MIDI channels, each with separate waveform and ADSR envelope settings\nMIDI over 5-pin MIDI jack or USB\nMIDI over USB works with DAW software on Mac and Windows computers as well as iOS and Android devices\nlow pass filter with cutoff frequency and resonance controls\n2 independent low frequency oscillators (LFOs): pitch and filter\nselectable waveform for LFOs\n1V p-p audio output voltage with enough current to drive headphones\narpeggiator mode, up to 16 notes\n4 arpeggiator patterns: up, down, up-down, random\n4 built-in arpeggiator chords or use MIDI to specify up to 16 notes\narpeggiator pitch transposition control\ntempo control with MIDI clock input\n16-step live performance \"groovebox\" sequencer\nsave/load patches and sequences in EEPROM\npitch fine-tuning adjustment\nprogrammable/upgradable over USB\nHardware Features\nBack view: MIDI input, mini USB, 1/4\" mono audio output\n1/4 inch ( 6.35 mm ) output jack: Works with headphones, line output for recording, and direct connecting to standard guitar amplifier. We will include a 1/4 to 1/8 inch stereo adapter with each Synthino XM for headphone/earbud use. When running on 9 volt battery power, the unit turns off when the audio plug is removed.\nStandard 5-pin MIDI input jack: This allows you to plug-in any standard MIDI keyboard, interface, sequencer, or drum machine to control the Synthino XM.\nUSB mini jack: Allows MIDI over USB functionality. This modern implementation enables sequencing and control from iOS, Android, PC,  and Mac devices. It can also be used to upgrade firmware using a simple upload utility. Synthino XM can also be powered from the USB port of cell phone charger, laptop power, or battery pack.\nLaser-cut acrylic cover: The top and bottom of the device are laser-cut frosted acrylic that give the Synthino XM a gorgeous finish. We searched far and wide for acrylic with just the right look.\nKnobs, Buttons, and Blinking LEDs\nWe wanted a fun, tactile, aesthetically pleasing user interface free of distractions and with just enough buttons and knobs that change your parameters on the fly so you can instantly explore new sounds. The software modes we designed are geared towards people to have fun playing around without any previous musical experience and at the same time we have a powerful live sequencer groovebox mode that every synthesizer fan will enjoy. The visual indicators are in the form of 4 bright orange LEDs located below the buttons. \nSoftware\nThe Synthino XM has 3 modes: synthesizer, arpeggiator, and groovebox. When Synthino XM is powered on, all the LEDs blink, prompting you to select a mode by pressing one of the buttons (1-3).  In some modes, the pots have secondary functions labeled as \"fn:\". These functions are enabled/disabled by pressing button 4. When \"fn:\" functions are enabled, the LED under button 4 flashes. The entire device can be reset by holding button 4 for 3 seconds, allowing you to choose a new mode to use.\nMode 1 - Synthesizer\nSynthesizer mode allows you to play the Synthino XM with a MIDI controller connected to the MIDI jack or from your favorite DAW (digital audio workstation) software with MIDI over USB. You can also play the synthesizer in standalone mode using the 3 note buttons. Explore different sounds by changing the waveform, controlling the note envelope parameters (ADSR - attack, decay, sustain, release), modulating the pitch and filter with independent LFOs for each, and adjusting the low pass filter.\nThere are 4 independent voices corresponding to MIDI channels 1-4. Each voice can have its own envelope and waveform, allowing you to play 4 completely different sounding instruments at the same time. Use the voice select knob to choose a voice (indicated by LED) and then use waveform and ADSR knobs to modify that voice's parameters. The LFOs and filter, however, are global and affect all voices.\nThe Synthino XM is 5-note polyphonic, and the 5 simultaneous notes can be played on any combination of voices. For example, all on one voice when playing from a keyboard, or the 5 notes can be spread across the 4 MIDI channels when sequencing the Synthino XM from DAW software on your computer.\nSynthesizer demo:\nMode 2 - Arpeggiator \nThe arpeggiator lets you play predefined arpeggios or set your own arpeggio notes with MIDI. Use the pattern button to cycle through the patterns: up, down, up-down, and random. Use the chord/MIDI button to cycle through predefined 4-note chord arpeggios: major, minor, M7, and m7, or to select MIDI mode which creates an arpeggio with currently played MIDI notes (up to 16 notes!). Of course you can change the speed (BPM), transpose arpeggios up and down, and modify the envelope, waveform, and filter parameters. There's a ton of fun to be had, even when using the arpeggiator in standalone mode without any MIDI input.\nArpeggiator demos:\nMode 3 - Live performance \"groovebox\" sequencer\nGroovebox mode is the most sophisticated feature of the Synthino XM. It is a \"live\" 16-step sequencer which allows you to lay down 4 different tracks by playing a MIDI controller. For simplicity when performing a live sequence, this mode does not have secondary functions on the pots.\nWhen the sequencer is running, any note or drum sample you play will be recorded to the current track and repeated as the sequencer runs. Change tracks using the track select knob. Each track can have its own envelope (AR) settings. The individual notes on a single track can even have different waveforms, so you can create very rich, complex sequences. The clear track button clears the currently selected track, and the preview button lets you play notes/samples with your controller without recording them so you can hear what it will sound like. The track fader knob lets you control the volume of each track individually, and transpose lets you transpose notes up/down (but drum samples won't transpose). You can even enable a metronome to help with your timing. The Synthino XM groovebox mode is incredibly powerful and expressive. No musical talent is required to make great sounding sequences! And when you have a great sequence you can save it to memory to recall later, even after the power is turned off.\nGroovebox demos:\nSynthino XM is better...\nPowerful microcontroller - The ATxmega128a4u has 2x speed, 4x flash memory, 4x SRAM of any comparable Aduino based synthesizer out there. Waveforms are synthesized with a true 12-bit DAC for smooth sound. This is not scratchy PWM audio!\nMIDI Over USB - Note sequencing from Android with OTG (On-The-Go) cable, USB Camera Adapter on iPad or iPhone. Standard USB port on Desktop PC or Laptop. Drivers are pre-loaded on all those systems. It will just show up as \"Synthino XM\" under MIDI Output Interfaces.\nBuilt for easy upgrades and customization - We will release mechanical drill files for anyone who wants to integrate the Synthino XM into a custom project. We take the community of our users seriously and any improvements and upgrades will be considered. Custom colors of laser cut panels and accessories will be eventually available.\nMade in USA - By keeping our fabrication and assembly in-house we can afford to expand and economically create the Synthino XM. With fewer middle men you as a backer and future customer will received the best deal. We also take pride in being a local business.\nOur Story  \nWe are both experienced \"makers\" that have both run our own electronics business for years. In fact, we were both recently profiled in the new book Maker Pro published by Maker Media:\nMichael Krumpus and Alex Dyba both featured in Maker Pro\nWe started collaborating on Synthino project in early 2014, the finished design you see evolved almost naturally because the hardware was telling us what to do. Initially the synthesizer experiments were coded for the nootropic design's Audio Hacker Shield, surely it made sounds but limited by only 5 buttons and 3 pots with no way playing notes, but even with the added MIDI shield, we obviously had monstrous setup was not clean, friendly, or practical. \nAudio Hacker synthesizer prototype\nYet those steps helped us to define the limits of what we wanted in a portable microcontroller synthesizer. Our team had a deadline later that spring, a pivotal point and we concentrated on developing a standalone synthesizer not a collection of Arduino shields. Thanks to Michael's tireless efforts writing the software and laying out the hardware to incorporate Alex's functionality suggestions the Synthino ONE was born and debuted at the Maker Faire Bay Area 2014.\nWe had overwhelmingly positive feedback and of course plenty of suggestions from people who stopped by our booth. Before boarding the plane for cold Minnesota Alex contacted RobotSpeak synthesizer specialty retailer in San Francisco, although an actual meeting never happened that contact led to surprise project producing 100 units over the summer for the band Information Society! \nInformation Society Deluxe Synthino ONE Project\nIn August of 2014 we fulfilled out obligations of delivering the units to be included in the band's deluxe box set of their new record _Hello World. The Deluxe release sold out within hours. \nNEW Synthino XM Production Version\nWe learned so many things from painstakingly creating over 100 units by hand and soldering thousands of through-hole components. The functionality and features were all squeezed out of the Synthino ONE's same as Arduino ATmega328 hardware. We needed faster fabrication and a faster processor with double the speed and 4 times as much memory. From the Atmel ATxmega128a4u the new Synthino XM was prototyped and born. \nOver the fall and winter of 2014 we continued the work on Synthino XM perfecting the code and improving our manufacturing processes to be able to produce the new XM units in-house. We chose white circuit boards, orange LEDs and frosted acrylic for an aesthetically pleasing design that will get attention for its beauty, not just its great sound.\nRewards\nAlex Wearing a GetLoFi Black GetLoFi T-Shirt - $20 reward level\n2 T-Shirt Options, we will contact you for size.\nProject Timeline\nWhy Crowdfunding? \nWe know that this Kickstarter campaign will be the best way to get the word out about our awesome product. We ask for your support to validate our vision of a fun user-friendly synthesizer by providing us with materials we need to make it a success.\n\"Synthino\" is a trademark of nootropic design, LLC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are experienced makers that both run our own electronics businesses and have proven track records in manufacturing and shipping to customers all over the world. But, like any complex project, there are some risks that could get in the way: \n\nProduction Equipment Failure: We are planning on using a shared laser cutter for this short run of Synthino XM units, its possible that the machine can break or be broken by another user. Our surface mount reflow oven may malfunction and cause delays until new one is acquired. \n\nSoftware Bugs: It is possible that there could be grave software errors that may not manifest until after the units are shipped. Although the units can be easily updated over USB it is an extra step we would not be thrilled with making users do. \n\nComponent Failures: It is also possible that any one of the parts we receive and use in our batch of units could be faulty and fail from repeated use of Synthino XM.

Maybe an LED, touch sensor, or some other genius invention to solve the world\u2019s problems?  Help us launch Conductive PLA and you will be able to!   \nProto-pasta Conductive PLA is an FFF/FDM 3D printing filament designed for users interested in combining 3D Printing and electronics. It allows you to print conductive assemblies that integrate switches, potentiometers, LED\u2019s, capacitive touch sensors, and more!\nProto-pasta Conductive PLA Highlights\n1-High electrical conductivity, between 60X and 700,000X more conductive than readily available conductive filaments at 15 ohm-cm\n2-Compatibility with other PLA materials for use in dual-head printers with good layer adhesion for creating circuits\n3-Reduced brittleness over existing conductive products (filament is quite flexible)\n4-Excellent print quality\n5-Proto-pasta Conductive PLA is affordable\nWhat is it made of?\nProto-pasta Conductive PLA is a compound of Natureworks 4043D PLA, a dispersant and conductive carbon black.  \nHow conductive is \u201cconductive\u201d?\nGreat question!  Here are the numbers:\nVolume resistivity of molded resin (not 3D Printed) \u2013 15 ohm-cm\nVolume resistivity of 3D printed parts perpendicular to layers \u2013 30 ohm-cm\nVolume resistivity of 3D printed parts through layers (along Z axis) \u2013 115 ohm-cm\nResistance of a 10cm length of 1.75mm filament \u2013 1.8Kohm\nResistance of a 10cm length of 2.85mm filament \u2013 600ohm\nThe measure normally used to characterize a conductor is \u201cvolume resistivity\u201d with the units of Ohm-cm.  This can be confusing because it is not obvious what it means like \u201cmiles per hour\u201d.  It is simply the resistance through a 1cm X 1cm X 1cm cube of material, with full sheet contact at 2 opposing surfaces.  It is often misprinted as ohm/cm which is not a common unit of measure.\nWe measured the conductivity using a fixture we machined that clamps a sample between 2 sheet conductors and 1cm cubes printed on a Printrbot Simple Metal and machined from solid resin. \n Measuring Volume Resistivity of Molded Resin\nPrinting Samples on Printrbot\nPLAY\n\nSo how strong is it?\nWe have not done substantial mechanical testing on this product but have some subjective parameters that should be useful in comparing this material with others.\n-Strength:  Fair strength.  More flexible than PLA, but less layer adhesion\n-Stiffness:  Low, semi-flexible\n-Heat Resistance:  Similar to PLA, use below 50C\n-Layer Adhesion:  Fair layer adhesion.  Not as good as normal PLA\n-Flexibility:  Filament is quite flexible but will break if bent repeatedly (particularly 2.85mm).  Printed parts are rigid if more than a mm or two thick.  Thin sections are somewhat flexible but fail along layer lines if flexed more than a few times.\n-Failure Mode:  If flexed to breakage, failure will be along layer lines.\n-Warping:  Very low warping\n-Dual-Head compatibility:  Compatible with (sticks to) PLA in dual material prints\nPrinting\nProto-pasta Conductive PLA is quite easy to print and is compatible with most printers that can print PLA.\nParameters:\nBed Temp if available: 50C\nHot End Temp: 230C\nRewards\nWe have a number of rewards that we are excited to share! \n$15 + Shipping - 125g Loose Coil of Conductive PLA in 1.75mm or 2.85mm\nOne 125g Loose coil (no spool) of high quality Conductive PLA in 1.75mm or 2.85mm diameter.

It\u2019s easy to use the browser-based control panel to start, pause, and resume prints, stream from a webcam and slice your STL files. The Photon Elephant is the simplest electronics solution for getting a 3D printer up and running without needing to coordinate a bunch of independent software and firmware tools. \nUnlike existing solutions, we use the Raspberry Pi\u2019s GPIO pins to directly drive the motor controllers for your printer. We even went a step further and built a convenient SDK that makes Photon Elephant a tinkerer\u2019s dream! Do you want to try incorporating sensor feedback to close the loop and get perfect prints every time? Maybe you want to build an SLS printer, but the standard five motor controllers just aren\u2019t enough? We provide a simple specification so the Makers and Hackers of the world can spend more time innovating and less time figuring out the inner workings of firmware code.\nPhoton Elephant is a bundle of hardware and software built around the Raspberry Pi that controls your 3D printer. Many printers today use a Raspberry Pi to send commands to an Arduino, which actually manages the motors and sensors, but has no operating system. Photon Elephant eliminates the Arduino entirely, putting the power of linux directly on your printer!\nWe think that creating new and exciting 3D printers should be easier, so we set out to make a simple and powerful platform that anyone can build on. We found the process of working with the available open source solutions to be tedious and out of date. The next generation of 3D printers deserve better. That's why we built Photon Elephant.\nPhoton Elephant is built for Hackers, Makers, Students and Entrepreneurs! It can handle the whole stack, controlling everything from the User Interface to the motors and sensors! If you just want to get a printer up and running, Photon Elephant does the work of a slew of other products, making it the simplest solution available. If you are looking to do something new, the SDK makes Photon Elephant the easiest platform to build on.\nNever flash firmware again! We\u2019ll send you an SD card (or an image if you\u2019re feeling a bit more adventurous) and you just plug it into the Raspberry Pi. Wire any compatible* printer up to the Photon Elephant companion board, and you\u2019re ready to go! No more worrying about making a bunch of different programs like slicers, firmware and printer managers talk to one another. Just open a browser on any device on your WiFi and start printing!\n*We currently officially support only Cartesian RepRap-style printers (Prusa, Printrbot, etc.). We are actively working on support for Delta printers and SLS printers, while our SDK can be used to easily support almost any printing methodology.\nWith the Photon Elephant SDK, we empower both hobbyists and startups like never before!  We expose an additional header coming off our companion board with 40 pins for you to run custom motors and sensors to your heart\u2019s content! Using our SDK, you can create powerful plugins to control your own electronics and unleash totally new tools on your 3D printer.\nSimple additions like extra motors or extruders only require tweaking some XML. If you want to do something more complicated, you can use the SDK to easily add support for anything you can imagine! Maybe you want to start incorporating new sensor feedback data into your print process to improve reliability, or you want to add an extruder that uses a bunch of motors for full color? The Photon Elephant SDK is built for this kind of thing! Understanding a few of our system calls is all you need in order to get up to speed and start hacking. You worry about the high-level logic of what you want to do, and we\u2019ll worry about the rest!\nFor More Information Check Out Our Developer Blog!\nThe 3D printing industry is shifting so quickly that today\u2019s high performance printer is tomorrow\u2019s paperweight. Given how hard it is to predict the direction the industry will shift, flexibility is the name of the game. It doesn\u2019t make sense to spend your time modifying firmware directly on a chipset that might not be used at all tomorrow.\nPhoton Elephant\u2019s SDK helps you keep up with the rest of the industry by making it easy to add new features to your design.

What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not.  Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn.  Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating.  It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With KickStarter's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.\nLet's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder is no exception to that rule.  The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets.  If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories.  So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight.  You can't.\nBut if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.\nWe'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories.  Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising.  If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.\nIf you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold.  If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment.  If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.\nSo, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute.  Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder and enhance your calorie burn.\nWhether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort.  Note that The Cold Shoulder cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.\nThe Problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories\nThe first thing I always hear when I say I\u2019m touting a \u201ccold vest\u201d is, \u201cI don\u2019t like being cold.\u201d But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over\u2010stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro\u2010intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.\nThere is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long.  There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories.   But it's not.\nThe Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure\nIn addition to exercise, there\u2019s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It\u2019s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you\u2019re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact \u2013 and I should know,  since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.\nThe idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.\nI was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, \"If cold exposure burns calories, there\u2019s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn.\" That\u2019s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. The vest looks like this:\nThe Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest\nI have put it to the scientific test and proved this vest's efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Here are a few before-and-after shots after just 3 weeks of using The Cold Shoulder:\nResults of 3 weeks of wearing The Cold Shoulder\nConsidering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?\nWhy You\u2019ll Love The Cold Shoulder\n1. Burns calories without exercise. Whether you\u2019re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you \u2013 the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.\n2. Saves time. It takes about 30s to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Then you go about your day until the ice melts, and it's another thirty seconds to take it off and put it back into the freezer.  Do that twice a day, and you've spent 2 minutes to burn 500 calories. Compare that to the same calories burned in a gym workout, which can consume several hours once you include travel time, change room time, and waiting for the machines that are busy when you want to use them. Two minutes vs. two hours, for the same 500 calories.\n3. It\u2019s effective. The idea is based on decades of research by scientists from Harvard to Cambridge and beyond. Mild cold exposure burns calories \u2013 it\u2019s a scientific fact. The only question is how to do it comfortably, effortlessly.... even fashionably!\n4. It\u2019s comfortable. The first time you wear it, yes, it'll feel cold. But you won\u2019t shiver. After trying it a few times, you\u2019ll hardly notice you\u2019re wearing it. Some of our current users actually look forward to putting it on.\n5. It gets more effective the more you use it. As your body acclimatizes to periodic mild cold exposure, it gets more used to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories. It gets easier and easier to burn off more and more calories, just like going to the gym gets easier the more you do it. This is exactly opposite to drugs or supplements, which usually decrease in effectiveness as your body builds a tolerance to them.\n6. It\u2019s fashionable. You can wear it pretty much anywhere. I've worn it to fancy French restaurants, as part of a 3-piece suit. I even tried wearing it on my wedding day, but my fianc\u00e9 \u2013 now wife \u2013 decided it wasn\u2019t quite ready for that.\n7. Sold direct at wholesale prices. Expect to pay significantly more once this is available in retail stores. There\u2019s no middle man on KickStarter. We\u2019ll manufacture your vest and ship it directly to you.\nHow Does It Work? \nThe Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn\nYou don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure \u2013 such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank \u2013 can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you.  On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.\nFor example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. It\u2019s the water. They spend their day in water that\u2019s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.\nDue to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.\nAny mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it\u2019s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it\u2019s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.\nOur vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:\nDue to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.\nThese are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you'd burn without it.\nExample clinical trial result - Nick Hamilton\nBelow is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss.\nNick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen.\nEvidence from independent scientists\nFor more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it's independent and objective.\nOur Mission\nWe want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn\u2019t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.\nWhy We Need You!\nAlthough we have the designs and prototypes finished and our manufacturer stands ready to produce the vests, the cost of production is high unless we fulfill minimum order quantities. In order to cover the costs of fabric and production at this level, we need to commit to this minimum order quantity to secure the best deal, which can then be passed onto you, with special rewards exclusively offered here on Kickstarter!\nWill It Fit Me?\nWe have sizes to fit everybody from XS to XXX-L. We\u2019ll get your sizing option after the funding period is over.\nThe Details\nInside-out view of the front + back of the vest, showing ice pocket locations.\nRe-inforced stitching at stress points\nVelcro closure on ice pockets to firmly hold ice packs in place\nVelcro closure at the front of the vest, which allows tightening the waist as you lose weight\nThe Cold Neck can be used alone or in conjunction with the vest to add an additional 20-25% calorie burn.\nBacker Rewards\nStretch Goals:\nWomen\u2019s sizes: Although the current vest is unisex, it's not particularly flattering to the female form. If we reach about $40k in funding, we will have enough spare capital to hire a female clothing designer to design a version more tailored to the female form. We envision it as having a fashionable waist-level fabric body-wrapping belt to adjust the waist size, rather than Velcro.  If we get here, and you want a female version of the vest, you'll be able to choose that after the funding period is over, but it'll probably add about an extra month to your delivery date.\nProduction Plan\nOnce funded, we will put in our order for materials. Delivery and preparation of materials may take 2-4 weeks. During that time we\u2019ll confirm sizing for all of our backers and prepare the manufacturing process. To ensure quality construction, we\u2019re personally overseeing manufacturing of our vests in the Los Angeles Fashion district, which requires 4-6 weeks. We source our ice packs from the USA.  Once the vests are made, we\u2019ll prepare them for shipment (at most 1-2 weeks), and then ship them to your door (2-3 days Domestic US, or 1-2 weeks International). \nTotal time from funding to shipment: Between 8-12 weeks within the continental US, plus another 1-2 weeks for international shipments.\nOur Guarantee\nWe are confident that you will be happy with your vests and the results it will produce, but if for any reason you\u2019re not completely satisfied, just send it back (you pay shipping, and please give us a \u201cheads up\u201d first), and we'll repair or replace your vest and ship it back to you free of charge.\nTESTIMONIALS\n\u201cThe Cold Shoulder allowed me to cut body fat while still gaining Lean Body Mass. It\u2019s easy to use and makes experimenting with cold exposure simple.\u201d\u2013 Nick Hamilton\n\u201cAfter just 2 weeks wearing The Cold Shoulder, I lost approximately 5.5% of my body fat. A loss like this for effectively doing nothing is excellent.\u201d\u2013 Robert Camille\n\u201cIn addition to the extra 1.5 lbs I lost using The Cold Shoulder, my second favorite benefit was that my sleep improved. I wore it for a few minutes before bed every night and slept much more soundly than I had done for months.\u201d\u2013 Mike Sirak\n\u201cThanks to The Cold Shoulder I was able to eat 6000 more calories over two weeks while having friends and family visit without any weight gain. It is great to be able to indulge a bit without losing precious progress.\u201d\u2013 Kyle Timblin\n\u201cI lost 5 lbs and an inch off my torso in just 3 weeks using The Cold Shoulder. I wore it only once or twice a day, and it was cool and comfortable.\u201d - Jocelyn Hayes\n\u201cI lost 15 lbs. in 3 weeks.  I lost much of my stomach flab and it was easy to use!\u201d - Anthony Peters\nTHANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!\nPlease take a look at the rewards - we hope you'll take advantage of our special early bird offer, but any contribution big or small helps lots!

[and what are they?]  AND, of course, ADDING RFID BLOCKING!\nBig Skinny Solves the Top 5 Wallet Problems!\nIn-house designing... all models are based on customer feedback, and the collection evolves over time based on reported functionality and requests. Catherine can really sew; she and her mother Linda sewed our World's Largest Wallet that set a new Guinness World Record at 21 feet long and 10 feet high and it was on wheels!\n  RFID material\nUltra-thin at .08 mm, it's pretty cool looking with a metallic gold/silvery sheen because of the copper and nickel, and it is building a Faraday cage within your Big Skinny wallet to trap those RFID signals! You'll never see it because it is between our layers of nylon or leather/nylon which are almost as thin! Thin is always In and now you can be thin and safe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only major risk that we see is that the factory creating the special RFID layer might delay production in order to fit our small order into their schedule because we are only making one special custom roll of material, so we are only a small customer to them. But by the same token, it could work the other way; they could fit us into their schedule between larger customers orders too.\n\nWe think we have other production risks under control as we have worked already with our very reliable wallet factory and they are very familiar with our previous designs. Incorporating this extra .08 mm RFID layer should not be difficult judging by the prototypes we have created and are out in the world being tested for the past few months.\n\nThe major challenges in this project were creating the right metallic mix and combination of material so that this RFID layer was flexible, ultra-thin, and technologically effective in protecting most RFID frequencies. Balancing thinness and the needed RFID technological efficacy within our functional design aesthetic are the toughest parts of this project. Also, having fun was a must but I think we overcame that challenge in spades.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Good News-Shipping started last week!", "update_content": "happy Spring everyone,\nJust a quick confirmation: shipping from our Reno, Nevada warehouse started last week for domestic orders, and international orders are starting to ship this week.

Despite not making our funding goal, we are continuing the development of the Andromium Platform, and is launching a free public beta at the end of January.\n=========================================================\nToday\u2019s smartphones have power.\nA lot of power. \nThe Snapdragon CPU inside many of your devices is faster than the number one supercomputer in the world in 1996! And it could be just sitting idly in your pocket right now, as you browse Kickstarter on a clunky desktop computer.\nHowever, while smartphones have become incredibly powerful, they still lack the functionality of a desktop.\n\u2026 That\u2019s why we built Andromium.\nOur mission is to democratize the desktop: making it affordable and highly accessible. \nAndromium seamlessly turns your Android device into a desktop computer. It\u2019s affordable, and devilishly easy to use; simply install the app, and plug your phone into the dock.\nAndromium dock charging the smarthphone\nHardware: \nThe Andromium dock embodies sleek, clean design. It\u2019s a combination of the best aesthetics: beautiful, ergonomic, and pleasing to use. We built the Andromium dock with you in mind. We included three full-sized USB ports for all the accessories you would need on a desktop computer, including gaming devices. We\u2019ve also integrated a port for a power cord, so your phone is always charged. \nWe specifically designed the dock with portability in mind. We\u2019ve given it a light, durable, travel friendly design with a flip cover to protect it during transport. On top of this, the dock has been designed so to fit your device without having to remove its slim, protective case.\nAnd Andromium comes in any color. So long as it\u2019s white. \n(We\u2019re incorporating new colors as stretch goals!)\nWireless Keyboard and Bluetooth Mouse\nSoftware:\nMuch of Andromium\u2019s appeal is its software. Gordon \u2013 previously a Senior Engineer at Google \u2013 left the company to pursue his dream of making handheld desktops a reality. He built an incredibly sophisticated Android application and complete Operating System, that has turned this dream a reality. The Andromium OS works in synergy with the dock to turn your phone into a full-fledged desktop computer.  \nThe application integrates seamlessly with your phone, and can be entered and exited simply. While in desktop mode, your phone can still receive calls, text messages and push notifications - so you keep its complete original functionality.\nThe User Interface is receiving a completely updated redesign to make it even friendlier. We\u2019ve built out all the functionality, and we\u2019re ecstatic with how it works. We\u2019ve teamed up with some of the best User Interface and User Experience designers in the industry to take Andromium\u2019s aesthetics up to the quality of its performance. Adopting the best elements of Windows 7 and OSX UI paradigms, we\u2019re creating a sleek, intuitive experience that highlights Andromium\u2019s functionality and power.\nGame Time!\nWhy Andromium is perfect for you:\nIn our modern world, many people own multiple computers. It\u2019s not uncommon for someone to have a work laptop, a home desktop, a home entertainment system, and a smartphone. Up until now, this may have been necessary. However, with the power of Andromium, everything changes. \nYou can now watch movies, edit spreadsheets, create PowerPoints, and do your work, all from your phone! And, you can do all of this without sacrificing the efficiency and usability of a full screen desktop interface, or wasting money on buying extra computing hardware. As the power of smartphones evolve, the home is evolving with it.\n\u201cWith the power of Andromium, everything changes\u201d.'\nAndromium enables TRUE multitasking with a desktop browser\nWhat you can do on Andromium:\nAndromium turns your smartphone into a personal desktop computer. No catch. Play your favorite games with friends \u2013 Super Smash Bros, GTA, or Legend of Zelda. We can\u2019t promise Andromium will get you past the water temple in OOT, but it will certainly allow you to try. \nMake your work entirely mobile. Any time, anywhere there\u2019s a TV/Monitor and your smartphone, you have your entire desktop, OS, and files there with you. Create, edit, or collaborate using all of the programs of the Office suite. Andromium is optimized to allow you to use powerful and sophisticated programs without a worry, and without the limitations of a five inch screen. \nAndromium desktop UI\nDevices compatible with Andromium:\nAndromium is designed for the most popular series in Android phones, the Samsung Galaxy. It works with both the Galaxy S and Note series (S3 - 2GB RAM version, S4, Note2, Note3, Note4). Currently S5 does not fit in the dock due to the USB port cover, but rest assured - we are supporting S5 also, via Chromecast.\nUpdate (12/20/2014): To our backers, we heard you! We are expending our supported devices list: HTC One M8, LG N5/G3, Motorola Nexus 6, and One Plus One will be supported via Chromecast (see http://andromiumos.blogspot.com/2014/12/andromium-os-chromecast-nexus-6-support.html for more information on Chromecast support). We are also in the process of designing a new docking station for LG N4, HTC One M7 phones that can also be used for the devices listed above. (We are designing a new docking station because Samsung HTC/LG/Moto devices all uses different and incompatible USB video-out connectors, so 2 new dock design is required). Andromium OS will be Chromecast ready for our Late Jan 2015 Andromium OS Playstore release. We are targeting summer 2015 (July timeframe) to ship out the new docking stations for the LG and HTC devices, for user who want to use docking station instead of Chromecast.\nAndromium Lockscreen\nProject Inspiration\nIn part, Andromium is built on the legacy of Motorola\u2019s \u2018Webtop\u2019, and Ubuntu Edge. However, these projects were heavily governed by brand exclusivity, and non-modular software; meaning they would likely only ever be compatible with the specific device they were built for. Unlike these projects, our dream at Andromium is to develop this hybrid platform and make it ubiquitous, bringing it to as many models of Android smartphones as possible. We want to provide the option of a portable desktop from your smartphone, while still allowing users to choose their favorite phone. We want to break down the asymmetries between technological access in the developing and developed world, and the best place to start is maximizing compatibility.\nFuture Goals\nInternet is the great equalizer of the modern world. \nOur driving motivation and key medium term goal is to bring Andromium to developing nations where it can have the largest impact. This year, an estimated 224 million smartphones were sold in India alone. 92% of those sales were made to people who had never owned any computing devices before. Due to their relatively low cost, broad distribution and multi-purpose functionality, smartphones have proliferated throughout the developing world at rates much faster than traditional computers. \nMost families in these nations share a single entry level smartphone for their internet access. Their children are at an educational disadvantage. We want to empower those families to access a higher grade of technological opportunity at marginal costs. By making it possible for families to hook up their device to existing TVs, Andromium unlocks the full power of the Internet, computers and the opportunities these provide.\nWe hope we can extend this equality to families, providing them with access to powerful platforms to work, learn and play; natural extensions of desktop computing that the developed world takes for granted. We want to empower the billions of people who will own entry-level smartphones to access a higher grade of technological access at marginal costs. \nThe power of Smartphone\nThe Team\nGordon Zheng\nGordon has over 12 years of software development experience. With a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science and an MBA from Georgetown University, Gordon has the technical and business acumen to make Andromium a success. Before leaving to start Andromium, he was a Senior Engineer at Google, developing their global payment security and monitoring system. This is on top of being part of their Tier 3 Crisis Support team, where he helped handle emergency payment errors, and even combat malicious fraud. Unlocking the power of the smartphone is Gordon\u2019s passion. As the Head Developer of the Andromium project, he has realized the potential of the hardware we take for granted. Drawing on his years of experience at the top of his field, he has created a powerful OS application, and is excited to release his work to the world.\nAlejandro Zuccolillo\nMeet Alejandro Zuccolillo, our Director of Communication and Design. Graduating Cum Laude in Business Administration from Lynn University, Boca Raton, and with an extensive personal background in angel investment and entrepreneurship, he brings a wealth of clinical expertise and passion to Andromium. He has spent years doing philanthropic work with public schools in the Favelas of Paraguay, his home country, where he helped improve school infrastructure and taught English to students. These experiences cemented his belief in the capacity for Andromium to upskill and empower youth education and employment opportunities in developing nations. He believes Andromium could democratize the desktop, enfranchising his students \u2013 and many more - into the global economy.\nLydia Sugarman\nLydia is our Director of Marketing, and is bringing Andromium to the world. She founded her own marketing company, PrivateLabel Interactive, at the beginning of 2001. The mission has been to empower organisations, for profit and non-profit with smart online marketing to build engaged communities. She has managed sales and marketing and business development for entrepreneurial ventures in diverse business verticals, both in the US and internationally that provides broad-based insights.  Silicon Valley\u2019s start-up environment shaped her unique marketing perspective and we are ecstatic to have someone with her experience on our team, ensuring the power of Andromium reaches as many people as possible.\nProject Update:\nAs requested by few supports, we have included a video to provide a more details look of the Andromium Platform as well as OS walkthrough", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn terms of hardware, the Andromium device is already built and completely functional. We are counting on your support to enable production on a larger scale. \n\nOur software and UI are presently ready for Andromium users.

Once we\u2019ve launched, we look forward to working with more developers as they create applications for the platform. We\u2019ve created this powerful OS and we\u2019re really excited to see what people can build on it. \n\nWe\u2019ve worked hard, and we\u2019ve been cautious to not release this project for funding prematurely. Our meticulous attention to the technical aspects of this project, extensive testing, and knowledge of the entrepreneurial process have allowed us to minimize risks and prepare for inevitable challenges. \n\nWe hope you\u2019ll share in our excitement, our mission, and support Andromium in any way you feel appropriate.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Andromium Inc.\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nSentio (formerly Andromium) is building a future where the only computer you'll need is your smartphone.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Andromium Platform Post Kickstarter Campaign", "update_content": "Hi Andromium supporters and backers.

All interactions within Andromium apps are desktop style. Meaning double right click opens folders or apps, right selects and left click menu, app bar buttons to resize, maximize, minimize and close windows for each app, etc. With the completion of our SDK we can say that Andromium is an entire linux based desktop operating system that, while still running native android apps, takes over the phone when it detects a keyboard, mouse and video out (even via wireless, bluetooth or infrared--who uses THAT anymore!

X-Y Pad Mode for Intuitive Sound Creation! Use your finger as an instrument! Utilizing the touch panel, we will create a X-Y pad mode where users can generate sounds intuitively using their fingers.\nCheck out this KDJ-ONE walkthrough video by one of our developers.\n\nPLAY\n\n\n1. Everything you need for music production is already included\nThe KDJ-ONE includes a synthesizer, sequencer, and sampler.\nYou have 6 tracks for any combination of instruments or sounds you wish to use.\nChoose your sounds\nUse the synthesizer to change and mix wave forms, toggle ADSR parameters, select effectors to use, and add LFOs to spice things up.\nIf that doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry. You can use any of the several hundred preset instruments as-is. Each was created by industry leading sound designers Davide Carbone and Josh Abrahams, plus the synth master Katsunori Ujiie.\nSynthesizer editing the ADSR\nOnce you've selected a sound, you can lay notes down on an intuitive piano roll using the sequencer. There are various ways to record your sound; real time recording, step recording, or by just tapping on the touchscreen as if using a pen. Use whichever method you're most comfortable with to make the music that you want to make.\nSequencer with a piano roll\nIf you need to change the sound parameters at a particular time, you can use automation. Various parameters including volume, pan, and more may be changed according to the timing you want.\nNeed vocals on your track? Attach an audio interface via the USB port, connect your microphone, and turn on the sampler. You will get the vocal audio data, and you can even change the pitch or tempo without affecting the actual data, thanks to the ACIDized wav format.\n2. Create sound continuously for 10 hours\nWith its small size, light weight, and 10 hour battery life, you can bring it along with you anywhere you go. Whether you want to kill time during that long flight or you're overcome by sudden inspiration, the KDJ-ONE will be there for you.\n\n3. Intuitive controls with the Touch Panel, Jog Dial, Keypads,  Analog Stick, and D-Pad\nWhen it comes to making music, there's nothing like having a good set of keys in front of you. That's why the KDJ-ONE was designed with a velocity-sensitive keyboard, allowing for unparalleled precision when recording or performing live. Of course, there's no need to limit yourself to a single interface; the touchscreen, jog dial, and d-pad are all there to help you control your notes in a manner that's comfortable for you. For example, you can start out by laying down your notes with the keypad and then use the touchscreen or d-pad to shift them around. Select individual notes or a sequence and lengthen them or copy the pattern and have it repeat. No matter how you work, the KDJ-ONE aims to accommodate you.\n\n4. USB enables Wi-Fi, MIDI controllers, Audio Interface, PC, and storage connections\nThe KDJ-ONE is able to connect to various devices and networks via USB. Plugging in a Wi-Fi card will get you online to share your pattern data with others using SoundCloud, Facebook or Twitter, or download samples. While connecting a MIDI controller will allow you to control the KDJ-ONE with your favorite device. Audio interfaces can be connected to record from an external audio sources such as guitars or microphones. The KDJ-ONE also uses a USB connection to connect to your PC or storage device, allowing you to backup and secure your work or import/export samples and audio data such as vocals, guitar, or recordings of other live instruments.\n\n5. Win/Mac App & VSTi/AU Plugin support\nThe KDJ-ONE can be used in conjunction with DAWs such as ProTools or Cubase as a VSTi Plugin, or with Logic as an AU Plugin.\n\nComputer App - Plays nice with others\nIncluded with every purchase of a KDJ-ONE device is a copy of the KDJ PC application, which serves as an interface between your computer and the device. Using this tool you will be able to save and back up any work you've done onto your computer and, if you so desire, export the music to any other DAW you may own.\n\nThe PC application also features its own editing mode with a user interface optimized for keyboard & mouse control. For those of you experienced in creating music on your computers, we are confident that this solution will give you the tools you need.\n\n6. Perform live as a DJ!\nIf your creativity needs an output and you're no stranger to performing in front of crowds, hook up your KDJ-ONE to some speakers and try your hand at the (currently in-development) live performance mode. We're looking into using all of those handy buttons and dials to give you a device that can emulate common functions assigned to MIDI controllers. Some features on the drawing board include the ability to assign samples and loops to each key on the keypad.\n\nYou can program your sounds too\n\n7. SDK to create your own Apps\nCode-savvy musicians will be able to take advantage of the KDJ-ONE's open-platform SDK, which will allow them to modify the KDJ-ONE to their liking. Write and add apps as you need them or share them with friends!\n\n\nThe KDJ-ONE is the brainchild of Rui Sato, Yutaka Oowada, and Shinnosuke Asahara; the founding members of CyberStep and college buddies from the Tokyo Institute of Technology. To make their project into reality, they've gathered excellent illustrators and designers from across Japan and taken on an international team of community relation managers and support staff.  \n\nMeet our staffs:\n\nRui Sato - CEO of CyberStep  \nYutaka Owada - CTO of CyberStep\nShinnosuke Asahara - R&D Director of CyberStep\nMasashi Futada - Hardware Engineer  \nMichitaka Kawabe - Hardware Engineer  \nKeizo Maeda - Former tutor of TIOT, Hardware/Software Engineer\nShigeru Hiraki - Head of the System Engineering Department\nRyota Takahashi - Global Sales and Support\nAaron Hearn - Composer & Programmer\nByron Blakeman - US Sales and Support\nKeiichi Sueta - Designer\nYumi Tsukuda - Designer\nYasutomo Morita - Designer\nAnna Morozova - Web Designer\n\n\nCyberStep is a Japanese publicly traded company established in 2000. While the KDJ-ONE is CyberStep's first foray into developing commercial electronics, we have the personnel and connections to make this project into reality. To ensure that our supporters receive a device that they\u2019ll be satisfied with, we will oversee the setup and maintenance of the infrastructure from start to finish before starting production. All funds put towards the KDJ-ONE will be devoted to securing the proper facilities and materials required to ensure that the KDJ-ONE project is a success.

As the KDJ-ONE is CyberStep\u2019s first commercial electronic device, we are new to the process and are faced with a seemingly endless list of suppliers and parts, with no assurance concerning quality or reliability. CyberStep has already begun correspondence with factories in these regions in order to ensure a swift transition from parts selection, to manufacturing & assembly, and finally to distribution. \n\nCurrently, there is a possibility that some of the necessary parts may take up to 6 months to ship, which is why the shipment date has been tentatively established at July 2015. We will be providing our backers with updates as we progress through each step of the development process.\n\nCyberStep prides itself on embracing innovative ideas and looks forward to seeing the KDJ-ONE project become reality. A lot of resources have been invested into redeveloping the device, and with your help, we\u2019d like to make the final drive to bring these long-held dreams to fruition. Thank you for your support.

Whether he is on your desk in his Pixel Power board or in an Arduino, his big LED eyes draw you in. His large size makes him easy for makers of all ages and skills to build. \nEveryone Loves Chip!\nChip is easy to build for all skill levels, especially beginners. \nChip encourages exploration and play. \nChip can be used to learn other skills, such as programming. \nChip is fun. \nChip is educational and builds S.T.E.A.M. Skills.\nMany soldering kits do not offer anything more than a battery and a LED. Once completed, those kits end up in a drawer, never to be used again. At the other end of the spectrum, there are electronic kits that are really interesting but have so many parts that they are intimidating for beginners. That is why we designed Chip to be simple to assemble and interactive when complete. \nChip Builds S.T.E.M / S.T.E.A.M Skills\nSTEAM is an acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math education. STEAM is about developing innovators and critical thinkers. It is about real world learning. \nIn the real world, content knowledge is interwoven and layered, not isolated.  STEAM curriculum focuses on collaboration, cooperation, and communication through project-based cross subject learning. In the real world, for example, baking a cake requires one to use math, science, and art to accomplish the task. \nChip, is designed with these STEAM foundations in mind. Chip builds on skills sets and grows from an instructional electronics kit, to a soldering skill builder,  to a tool to teach and learn programming with.   \n\"Personal-Eyes\"\nEach kit comes with four sets of LEDS so that you can make your Chip your very own. Will you choose Buddy Blue, Radiant Red, Glowing Green, or Yummy Yellow?\nPixel Power \nEach Chip comes with it's own Pixel Power.  It is Chip's stand and battery power.  Like Chip, the Pixel Power is a cross-medium, multifunctional board and skill builder. \nThe Pixel Power starts as a kit, but when assembled it can be used for other projects. For example, it can be used with conductive thread as a sewable battery and switch for e-craft and e-textile projects. \nKit Contents\nEach Chip Kit Includes: CHIP PCB, Pixel Power PCB, (2) Buttons, Slide Switch, Male Right Angle Header, Female Header, (2) 220Ohm Resistors, Battery Clip, (2) 10mm Blue LEDS, (2) 10mm Red LEDS, (2) 10mm Green LEDS, (2) 10mm Yellow LEDs, (1) 3-volt Coin-cell Battery\n An Hour of Code\nWhen you plug Chip into an Arduino, you can control Chip's eyes with programming. Chip is an excellent way to get kids involved in Computer Science and take part in the Hour of Code initiative.  \nWhat is an Arduino? Arduino.cc\nSALDUINO UNO R3\nWe love the Arduino Uno R3.  It is one of the best boards for beginners and advanced makers.  We just wanted a few more features so we worked with Tully Gehan of Factory For All to create the SALDUINO UNO R3.  100% Arduino compatible and Chip fits perfectly. We include a USB cable to connect to your PC or MAC. As a special Kickstarter reward we have CHIP and a SALDUINO combo. \nWe need your support.\nPlease select a reward to help us make Chip a reality. \n\nYour pledges not only fund the mass production of Chip to an affordable price but helps us to continue developing more kits that makes learning electronics more accessible to all skill types, young and old.\n\nSo, please support us and spread the word.  \n\nEvery little bit counts and we are eternally grateful.\n\n\nThe design is done. The prototypes have been checked.  We have lined up our suppliers and have funded the early-bird rewards out of our own pocket so they can ship immediately in December. All we need now is your support, please choose your reward.\nThe Pixel Pals - a little history of Chip\nChip is a part of the Pixel Pals. He and his friends live on Planet M and they love making, tinkering, and inventing.  Through their adventures, they learn about different materials and technologies, solve problems, and explore new ideas. \nWe have plans for all the Pixel Pals. Each Pixel Pal has their own personality and functionality. Like Chip, they work as a standalone character or they can plug into Arduino.\nWe see the Pixel Pals as a way to connect with young makers and encourage them to explore and create.\nThe Pixel Pals journey started almost two years ago. We wanted characters that would be fun, have personality, and could be used to build STEAM and Maker skills. After many trials, we commissioned an artist who drew us the sketch below. When we saw it, we knew instantly that these were the Pixel Pals we envisioned. We have expanded the Pixel Pals to include eight characters and we plan to release each of them. \nPixel Pals Original Sketch\nThe Pixel Pals are not just electronics, but rather a set of characters that cross physical and digital mediums from electronics, e-crafts, 3D printing, programing, and digital design. Chip already has an adventure workbook.\nAt the Greater Newark Area Mini Maker Faire we introduced the very first Pixel Pal adventure - PIXEL PALS RESCUE MISSION: HELP CHIP FIX HIS CIRCUITS. The book is an introduction to paper circuits where you have to help Chip repair his ship. Geared towards the youngest makers, the activities in the book use everyday materials to create circuits. This and our current Kickstarter are just the tip of the iceberg of how we see the Pixel Pals can be used to build STEAM skills. \nAbout Soldering Sunday\nSoldering Sunday Team: Jean, Paul, Lee\nAn Adventure in Making Makers\nThe most import thing we make at Soldering Sunday is more makers. We believe that tinkering and making are part of who we are as humans and that the things makers make can change the world. It does not mater if you are an engineer, an artist, a mom, a dad, an educator, a student, a hobbyist, or a professional maker. We want to help you explore new ideas, connect with fellow makers, and create the things that you are passionate about.  \nKicking it Forward\nWe believe in the concept of Kicking it Forward, and it makes sense for us as creators to support other creators. http://kickingitforward.org\nI Want One But I Don't Know How To Solder\nNo problem. Soldering is not magic and it is not hard. It is a learned skill and with a little guidance anyone can do it.  Chip will come with a full set of detailed instructions, as well as a video how-to guide. For those teaching soldering, we will have curriculum for you as well. \n\nOne of our inspirations, and still the best soldering resource around, comes from Mitch Altman. Mitch Altman, Andie Nordfren, and Jeff Keyzer put together a 7-page comic book on just how to solder.  it is translated into numerous languages and is available for free.  (click on it to go to the Might Ohm download page)\n\nIf you are looking for personal help on how to solder and are local to New Jersey, you are always welcome to come to FUBAR Labs.  Every Sunday at FUBAR is open to the public for Soldering Sunday (yes, this is where we got our name from). Check the FUBAR Meetup Group for times and other classes. \nNot local to New Jersey, there are plenty of Makerspaces, Hackerspaces,  and Fab Labs around the globe where you can learn. \n\nThank you again for your support. You can always find us at SolderingSunday.com or on Tindie.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk the project has is a delay in production. We have worked with our suppliers for several years now and are confident with their track record that this is not a big risk at all. With that said, anything can happen, so we took additional steps to minimize any risk.\n\nFirst, we have gone through several small scale runs of prototypes and worked out any issues. Second, and most importantly, we have already ordered and funded the early bird rewards with our own money. We believe in this and we are in this with all of you. The early bird rewards are scheduled to arrive just before the completion of the campaign and will ship to backers as soon as payment is received. \n\nAdditional rewards will be ordered right at the completion of the campaign.

The most successful people in all industries have a sharp eye for analyzing information but yet have a very visually fluid process of thinking. We are all born with these latent capabilities. These features are inside each and every one of us but need to be nurtured for them to strengthen.\n\nWe think programmatic animation is one of the most fun, creative and powerful ways to engage your mind and at the same time create content that will stand out on the web.\nOne of our most popular courses is our HTML with Mom \u2013 where I grabbed my mom that barely know how to check her emails and taught her HTML. Check out some of our other projects on 02skills.com\nWe think learning should be fun and engaging for example our project from last year when My mom joined me to learn HTML \u2013 Check that intro out to see our style.\nWhy learn with us?\nLearning is about being part of a community\nWe know that learning a new skill is hard so we make it easier by making it easier for you to connect with other students learning the same thing at the same time. We integrated commenting in every area of the site to make it easier for you to interact with other students and with us. We have unlimited live support. We will never give up on you, we will be with you until you get it.\nOur motto is \u201clearning better is better\u201d. In the age of twitter and social media most modern online education content assumes a lot about the user. We do our best to simplify and make complex topics really simple and fun. So far we created 103 courses over the last 3 years. Our videos have been viewed over 1,000,000 times, we have 15,000 students and just crossed our 1000 4-5 star review line.\nOver the years we created many topics but most of them have never been published and are only available for our 02GEEK members. We didn't publish them because the costs associated with publishing content on the web: creating the art work, editing, promos, networking, ads and so forth. As such until now we only published courses we knew would sell well while courses we couldn't invest the capital in promoting them we kept as exclusive content for our members.Our goal is to publish our content and have it  on 02skills.\nThanks & giving 5% back\nThanks for believing in us and helping us cross our goal as our way to thank back the KickStarter community we will be kicking it foreword and investing 5% of our income back to projects of the community.  We want to thank KickStarter as well for making us a Staff Pick.\nAbout us:\nWe are not funded by any large cooperation nor do we have ambitions to take over the world.

It\u2019s really amazing that we've received pledges beyond our initial funding goal. Because of all of your support, we can make our dream come true. And now, we can offer you even more cool things.\nThere are 4 stretch goals. When the goals are met, the following additional rewards will be added to the rewards of every backer who get a machine (i.e. backers who pledge $499 or more). The rewards are all consistent with our 3 core ideas: UNLIMITED, ELEGANT, and SIMPLE. All of them will enhance the FLUX for every user.\nA Difficult Choice Made Easy\nWith so many 3D printer options, it can be difficult to decide on the right model. Luckily, FLUX makes the choice easy by combining printing, scanning, laser engraving, and more modular functions. It is the only 3D printer you will ever need \u2013 for work or at home.\nThe Right Choice for Everyone\nUnlimited, elegant, and simple \u2014 FLUX is the right choice for everyone because it is simple to set up, elegantly designed, and has an unlimited capacity for expansion. In addition to the basic FFF (fused filament fabrication) 3D printing, FLUX is equipped with a built-in 3D scanner and supports an ever-increasing array of interchangeable modules. FLUX is the everything 3D printer that grows with you\u2014 meeting not only your 3D printing needs today, but also of all your tomorrows.\nWith FLUX\u2019s modular design, customizing your FLUX experience to meet your specific needs is a cinch. Modules come with magnets for effortless interchangeability\u2013no tools needed.\n3D Printing\nFLUX\u2019s 3D printer uses high resolution stepper motors to print objects of stunning quality. The 3D printer comes with three efficient cooling fans that enable printing with precision at top speed while minimizing the risk of malfunction due to overheating.\n3D Scanning\nNot everyone can make 3D models. FLUX has a built-in 3D scanner that allows you to clone 3D objects effortlessly \u2013 just like using a copy machine. No need to learn complicated software! The only limit is your imagination.\nLaser Engraving (Expandable Option)\nPersonalize your creation with FLUX\u2019s laser engraver. FLUX\u2019s first interchangeable module is a 200mW laser head that allows you to take your creativity to the next level.\nAnd MORE!\nThe laser engraving module is only the beginning. Many other modules are under development, including a dual extruder, a ceramics extruder, and a pastry extruder (for chocolate, jam, and many other edibles).\nFLUX has an open module SDK. Besides developing our own new modules, we have also invited other talented engineers to create more modules and to share their ideas with the user community. We are collaborating with several promising startups to develop innovative toolheads for special materials and applications!\nFLUX is the most elegant 3D printer on the market. Enjoy watching your creativity take center stage!\nPerfect for Any Setting\nFLUX is extremely compact. Unruly wires are hidden from sight. Its elegant look fits any setting or decor. It is small enough to blend in with your living space but large enough to satisfy your creativity.\nFLUX is not only just another gadget \u2013 it will change how you see the world. Imagine this: you want to prepare a special gift for your significant other. She adores chocolate \u2013 and elephants. If only you could give her a chocolate elephant. \nWith FLUX, you can! Simply choose an elephant model from the open source files or scan your own model, swap in the chocolate-printing module, and press print! Why settle for a generic gift when you can customize the perfect present every time?\nSimple Setup \nGo from unboxing to printing in just a few minutes. FLUX is built with several easy-to-assemble modular components. When FLUX needs repair, just replace specific parts instead of the entire machine.\nWi-Fi Operation\nOperate FLUX with ease from your smartphone! FLUX is designed to connect wirelessly to your smartphone, tablet, or other devices via Wi-Fi. \nFLUX Studio: User-friendly Interface\nFLUX Studio (currently in development) provides user-friendly softwares for more sophisticated design needs. FLUX Studio simplifies the process of 3D modeling, hardware control, and system configuration. \nWhile FLUX Studio is extremely intuitive and easy for beginners, the advanced settings also provide a robust tool for professional users.\nFLUX was built from scratch. We gathered the team and each member wrote down all the functions and capabilities we wanted in FLUX. Some were attainable while some were just fantasy, but that\u2019s where our dream started.\nWe took the best parts of open source designs and infused them with our own ideas. Our dream took shape with the rotatable base for the scanner, interchangeable modules, and seamless integration of software and hardware.\nWe have been through 4 different prototype versions and built over 30 working units. We showcased our creation at Maker Faire. We are now ready to take the next step of mass production.\nWe want to create a 3D printing lifestyle where everyone can explore his or her creativity. To enable this lifestyle, FLUX is priced within the reach of most households.  \nOur machine is fully functional as demonstrated by our video. Our current main priority is to begin mass production. Building a single prototype and producing in large quantities are two different things. We are doing everything we can to provide you the best product, but we will need your support for our project and our dream.\nWhile we prepare for mass production, we are putting on the final touches to refine the existing integration of the software and hardware. \nWe are a young, but professional team from Taiwan. We have recruited top talent who share the same passion for 3D printing and the dream to bring 3D printing into everyone\u2019s lives.\nOur team includes specialists in industrial design, software programming, hardware engineering, marketing, and operations. Our team slowly came together through previous business projects, where we not only acquired knowledge and experience in a range of fields, but also learned how to work seamlessly as a team. Now is the time for us to combine our talent and passion to build FLUX through mass production.\nWe also have many experienced mentors, advisors, and motivators behind the scenes. Of course, that includes our backers on Kickstarter! We believe that our team will get bigger and stronger with your support!\nWe are honored to announce that the team of Discov3ry (www.structur3d.io) has collaborated with us as our first partner in technological development in early October this year. With their outstanding input, we believe that all modules of FLUX can be developed sooner and work better!\nThe Last Magical Ingredient: You\nWe are dedicated to beautify all that is around us by promoting the use of 3D printers. We believe that this will lead to improving the quality of people\u2019s lives, and our ultimate dream of changing the world.\nAppreciation is extended to every open-sourcer that has made this product possible. This is just the beginning of our journey, and we are inviting you to join us. If you are interested in our product, we look forward to hearing from you. Whether you make an actual purchase or simply offer a piece of advice, your feedback is extremely valuable to us.\nWe are grateful to everyone who has helped us out along the way, and that includes you. Thanks for reading about our project and hopefully we can hand over our FLUX to you in the near future.\nAnd Creators Of Magical 3D Models!\nJulia Vase #011 by Virtox\nLow-Poly Totodile by Flowalistik\nMarble Head by Bdipaolo\nWith Creative Commons - Attribution License", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly. We have worked extremely hard to prepare this product for manufacturing, but we still face several challenges.\n\nINJECTION MOLDING\nFor a high quality machine, we require precise parts. Therefore, we decided to produce our parts with injection molding. Injection molding requires large capital expenses, which means that we need to secure a very reliable manufacture partner that will deliver great quality. We have talked to many reliable manufacturers in Taiwan who would like to support our production. All we need is the capital to execute mass production. There is typically a 60-day lead time to fabricate the molds, and this is where delays may occur because we strictly demand the best quality for our parts. To prevent this delay, we have also been working hard with mold design specialists.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS \nOur components can be divided into two categories: injection molding parts and other parts. We have already secured some of the suppliers for the other components. The remaining issue is setting up warehouses for the production line. This is why we are constantly working with supply chain specialists to establish an efficient and reliable production line \u2013 so that we can deliver this amazing product to you as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "FLUX Delta Family Warranty Policy", "update_content": "Hello, FLUX Delta and FLUX Delta+ users!\nAfter busy months of production and shipping of our new product, FLUX Delta+, our community is growing stronger and more people are enjoying the fun of digital creation. \nTo provide better customer support, we will update the FLUX Delta Family (FLUX Delta / FLUX Delta+) warranty policy, the new policy will be effective in one week (2017/5/5).\n[ FLUX Delta Warranty Policy Update ]"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "To Enter the 4th Year of FLUX!", "update_content": "Hi backers,\nIt's been a while since the last Kickstarter update.

But Google hasn\u2019t built an app for Gmail on the desktop like it has on iOS and Android.\nApps like Outlook and Mail wipe away all the unique power of Gmail, leaving many of us to do on the desktop what we\u2019d never want to do on our phones - use it in the browser, buried in the chaos of web browsing.\nWe\u2019d dreamed of turning Gmail into a powerful, fluid email client that not only makes Gmail easier to use, but goes way beyond and makes a beautiful statement about what email itself could be like.\nAfter 18 months, it\u2019s now almost here. We just need your help to launch.\nIn building a humanized email client, we wanted to acknowledge basic truths -- like that many of us have more than one Gmail account (personal, school, work, etc). We wanted you to avoid having to sign in over and over every time you close your browser or restart your computer, and we wanted it to work all the time, flawlessly.\nGoogle has struggled to make this work well at all in the browser, where you frequently get signed out at random and generally have a poor experience. We spent months developing and refining a new technology that allows it to \"just work\" work all the time, without sign-ins or typing or any extra effort on your part. \nUSE YOUR EMAIL WITHOUT BEING BURIED BY IT\nA huge piece of what we wanted to do with Gmail for Mac was to radically simplify the effort and \"cognitive burden\" of using your email. It's something we do all day long, all the time, and it should be as easy as breathing. \nWe've made radical new ways - entirely unique to our client - for filtering out the noise of email alerts and unread counts that come at you all day long. We've also honed the user experience so that nearly everything you do constantly can be reached in a single click or gesture (navigating your email, writing a new message, opening your inbox, etc). This is the kind of iOS-like focus & simplicity that has liberated us all on mobile. We wanted to do that for email on the desktop. \nAND...\nSIMPLE. POWERFUL. BEAUTIFUL.\nThe difference between using Gmail in the browser and Gmail in our streamlined and powerful app is enormous, and ultimately one we feel will make your email life easier and more friendly. \nMore Details\nABOUT US\nThe guys behind Zive are Eric Shashoua and Ryan Shetley, but we've been joined by an amazing team of designers and developers who share the same idealistic dream of beautiful, simple, and obsessively designed software. We believed we could make a real difference in some of the tools people use most often by making them beautiful, seamless, and effortless on a level that\u2019s encountered too seldomly outside of Apple. We wanted to build a company where the work itself mattered more to us than the bottom line or any traditional goal of business. And ... we wanted it to be human. \nOur team brings to Zive 10+ years of experience designing and developing software and consumer electronics, as well as developing for iOS and the Mac. As the former CEO / Co-Founder of Zeo, Inc., Eric raised $14M in venture funding and had a chance to work with the leaders of Bose and iRobot in learning how to design products that are truly focused on the user. Zeo\u2019s products have been marketed and sold throughout the US and Europe, and have led to being called out to Cupertino in connection with being featured in Apple Stores. Ryan brings to our bold and scrappy team a novel approach to technology, where engineering effort is focused intensely on the user experience rather than the usual product development approach. The rest of our team consists of awesome and intensely passionate designers, a couple artists, and folks who've spent years developing for and falling madly in love with the Mac.  \nDisclaimer: Though we love Gmail and we love the Mac, Zive is not affiliated in any way with either Google nor Apple and is an independent third party. Gmail for Mac, by Zive, is a product made entirely by Zive, Inc. and no other company. \nWe need your help! Where the funds go:\nWe already have a polished alpha, but we've started this Kickstarter to get to launch. What that means:\nBeta testing phase before launch\nOS X 10.10 Yosemite upgrade completion\nPossible Inbox by Google integration\nCommunity to help us test, give feedback, and ... well, we just think you guys would be awesome even if you do none of that. \nMarketing funding to help get the word out at launch\nSo, we're after supporters, a few enthusiastic folks to help us beta test, and launch funding to help kick off the product launch. Please join us and become a part of our bold dream to elevate Gmail to a whole new level!\nFor your support of us, we've lined up what we think would be really great rewards for anyone who joins on -- starting with a copy of the full version of Gmail for Mac! Take a look at our rewards right on this page!\nAnd thank you for supporting Gmail for Mac, by Zive!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile most kickstarters launch with a concept or prototype, we feel that most of the risk in our project has already been mitigated by having moved far beyond that stage to an alpha version of Gmail for Mac, by Zive. \n\nLaunch Timing: With any software development, there are potential risks in unforeseen variables causing delays in launch. While this is always a possibility, we don't expect this to play a significant role given the stage we're at. We have already made a tremendously detailed effort to create a streamlined and extremely reliable application. \n\nWe feel confident that we could launch Gmail for Mac not long after the conclusion of our Kickstarter. \n\nExperience: We've done this before successfully a few times over, and our team has extensive experience designing, building, and selling software through Apple's app and retail stores. \n\nThis is the only project we are running, and has the undivided attention of our team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 414, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1919581657/gmail-for-mac-finally-gmail-is-a-true-desktop-emai", "project_name": "Gmail for Mac: Finally, Gmail is a true desktop email client"}}, {"backer": "Dennis Hill, PhD", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Don't have time to see the full 7 minute video?Jump to the section most interesting for you:\nBITalino Introduction (2:46) | What's New (1:05) | Meet the Team (0:34)\nExamples:\nMotionBIT (0:45) | ArousalBIT (0:50) | MuscleBIT (0:44) | BITalino in Education (0:59)\nFollow us on:\n                 BITalino is a low-cost, purpose-built, all-in-one hardware and software toolkit designed for quick and easy creation of cool projects with body signals, development of quantified self wearable devices or apps, and/or learning how to build medical devices. Comparative professional-grade tools for this purpose can easily cost in excess of $10,000; our vision is to make them available for anyone, and harness the power and creative thinking of the open-source movement to boost innovation in biosignal-based applications in unprecedented ways.\nOut-of-the-box, BITalino provides a set of versatile, Arduino-compatible software and hardware blocks with sensors for Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Accelerometry (ACC), and Ambient Light (LUX), including Bluetooth Low Energy wireless communication to a software toolkit to see the signals in real time or replay offline. What\u2019s next? Ever since we launched, our dream has been to make BITalino more affordable, more capable, and packed with much-sought features our amazing community has been asking for. Your pledge will help us trigger a true BITalino (r)evolution!\nBITalino (r)evolution board\nBody signals have hundreds of applications; assistive technologies for people with disabilities, biofeedback for stroke and muscle disorders rehabilitation, or self-management of psychological disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression, PTSD, ADHD) are just a few examples. Still, BITalino is an unique DiY toolkit, which can be used by virtually anyone interested in creating projects ranging from muscle activated air drones to heart-rate monitoring bicycle handlebars, smart / enchanted objects, interactive installations, or affordable medical devices and personal diagnostics apps.\nBy supporting our Kickstarter campaign, you can potentially be contributing to revolutionise healthcare and biomedical engineering around the world. BITalino has grown to become the platform of choice for hundreds of people worldwide already, but it wasn\u2019t designed with financial profits in mind, hence the reason we need your help now.\nHeart rate monitoring bicycle handlebars\nBITalino armband controller using muscle & gestures\nLow-cost ECG data acquisition device with 3D-printed enclosure\nMakers: Whether you\u2019re looking for the next challenge or invention, or seeking to enhance an existing prototype, BITalino can open new and exciting pathways for your work.\nStudents: Pursuing a degree in areas related with body signals (e.g. medical, biomedical, psychophysiology)? Looking for a forward-thinking engineering or computer science project? Then BITalino is the right tool for you!\nDevelopers: Want to do quick and easy prototyping of wellbeing and quality of life wearable devices or apps? BITalino can greatly help you in cutting development costs and time.\nProfessors: Enrich your lab activities and student projects with BITalino; the modular hardware and software, makes it a convenient personal companion for your students, and the ideal tool to demonstrate theoretical concepts in practice.\nResearchers: Looking to quickly validate hypothesis, jumpstart your research on a budget, or collect data on dozens of users at once? BITalino can definitely give you a hand.\nQuantified-Selfers: If you\u2019d like to learn more about your body, keep track of your vitals, or create an affordable medical device, BITalino provides you professional-grade quality at DiY costs.\nOver the past year we proved the potential of BITalino, which is perfectly tried and tested and have sold over 1200 units; now we would like to take it to the next level. Our goal is to empower more people to learn, prototype, and build innovative projects with sensors for body signals acquisition both for serious and quirky applications alike. Any help counts and here\u2019s what we can accomplish with you as our backer:\nBITalino (r)evolution kits: That\u2019s right\u2026 our signature hardware base will be fully redesigned to have an incredibly smaller form factor, improved signal quality, Bluetooth Low Energy, digital-to-analog control, reprogrammable firmware, SPI interface for enhanced expansibility, and many other cool features. As before, it will come in the BOARD, FREESTYLE, and PLUGGED flavour, but this time even more affordable!\nBITalino (r)evolution BOARD, PLUGGED and FREESTYLE prototypes\nApplication-specific boards: Can\u2019t find a use for all of the sensors bundled with the kit? Not a problem anymore\u2026 make a pledge to us and we\u2019ll create a series of simpler and more affordable application-specific kits, namely, HeartBIT (1x ECG + 1x BVP), MuscleBIT (1x EMG + 1x ACC), ArousalBIT (1x EDA + 1x BVP), MotionBIT (1x ACC + 1x MAG), BrainBIT (2x EEG), FlowerBIT (1x LUX + 1x TMP + 1x IMP).\nBlocks available as individual components: Until now we haven\u2019t been able to make the different blocks available as individual components. Back us up and we\u2019ll be able to support the production setup costs needed to make batches with the sensor blocks and peripherals found on BITalino (and on the application-specific boards), enabling us to provide them as individual components.\nSensors and peripherals will become available as individual blocks\nAdditional sensors: Users have seen what we can do, and now they\u2019re asking for more; with your help, we\u2019ll be able to expand the possibilities of BITalino with additional sensors. Electroencephalography (EEG), Respiration (RSP), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Skin Temperature (TMP), Force (FSR), Load Cells, and many others.\nImproved cable quality: BITalino is completely rooted in DiY; for that, in the original version we focused on using cables and plugs that would be easily available for anyone, which have shown to have tradeoffs in terms of signal quality and robustness. BITalino (r)evolution will provide you the same DiY capabilities as our previous unit, with the advantage of offering professional-grade plugs and cables as a standard as well.\nBesides DiY cables and plugs, BITalino (r)evolution will have professional-grade counterparts\nMemory card accessory: The ability to roam around freely while recording your data for later inspection is an all time favorite\u2026 up until now you\u2019d need either a computer or smartphone to log your BITalino data. By backing us, you will be contributing to the development of an accessory interchangeable with the Bluetooth module, that has the ability to log the data collected by your BITalino and control it as well.\nGalvanically isolated USB: So, you\u2019re one of those people who would rather hook up a BITalino to a USB port rather than dealing with all the battery recharging fuss. The thing is that our computers are often either directly or indirectly connected to a mains. Most devices, and in particular the USB, have a few built-in safety features, however there\u2019s nothing like removing any electrical connection between the BITalino and any other circuits. With your help, we\u2019ll be able to create an accessory just for that.\nPrintoo paper-thin flexible technology: You know all too well how stiff PCBs and body curves don\u2019t always add up, and that\u2019s where your pledge come in... BIG TIME! We\u2019ve teamed up with our friends at Printoo to make both platforms compatible, but with your help, we can crank it up to outer space by creating a production version of BITalino based on Printoo\u2019s paper-thin, flexible technology! You\u2019ve read it well\u2026 all the BITalino (r)evolution coolness, in an awesome bendable, twistable, and anatomical form factor. Printoo mentioned in their Kickstarter campaign that it would be possible\u2026 we are making it happen!\nImagine a BITalino like this\u2026 with your help it can be possible!\nThe latest global trends such as the affordable care act from the Obama administration are geared towards making healthcare more accessible for everyone, and towards putting the users back in charge of their healthcare. Technology is a keystone in such change, and our vision is to make BITalino and the DiY body signals community unavoidable references by seeking to make body signals more affordable and accessible to the world.\nThe MakerNurse initiative led by MIT\u2019s Little Devices Lab is one compelling example of this vision. Our goal with BITalino is to get this expertise out of the hands of a few medical device companies and use your pledge to empower millions of students, researchers, makers and developers around the world. By providing low-cost, open-source, and easy-to-use hardware and software tools, more people will be able to learn and build novel applications using body signals, contributing to the creation of next-generation quantified self devices and applications.\nTo top it all up, BITalino is on the epicentre of the S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) movement. Imagine how having BITalino in classrooms can contribute to gear young minds all around the world towards finding novel and innovative ways of addressing prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of medical conditions. BITalino gathers the features and functionalities we would like to have had during our education; your support will help us make these technologies more accessible for youth everywhere.\nMoreover, we believe that there are other options beyond wearables, and BITalino has also been positively contributing to transition to a new generation of body signals acquisition technologies that are embedded into your surrounding environment. Some people call these \u201cenchanted objects\u201d, others call them\u201canti-wearables\u201d; the truth is that BITalino is enabling the creation of things like heart rate monitoring bicycle handlebars (as previously shown) and other devices alike. Whether you\u2019re into wearables or anti-wearables, BITalino is the right tool for you.\nResearch-grade body signal acquisition equipment is typically very cumbersome, prohibitively expensive, and with proprietary algorithms and hardware designs. On the other end of the price spectrum you either find affordable devices designed for leisure and quality of life applications but with fixed and unadaptable features and form factors, or DiY projects with a high overhead in terms of electrical engineering and programming skills.\nBITalino brings research-grade technologies to the masses, in the form of a complete DiY hardware and software toolkit accessible to any skill set, and that can be used for prototyping of wearable and quantified self applications in unprecedented ways. This is one kit with a world of possibilities... just take a look at some of the things you can do:\nSurf\u2019s up with MotionBIT\u2026 log your data while riding those awesome waves and share the stats with your friends\nLiving with ALS; use MuscleBIT to control a keyboard and mouse using residual muscle activity.\nArousalBIT allows you to check out your date in new and different ways ;)\nPractitioners can now create their own unique and affordable medical devices; imagine the difference your pledge can make for people in low-income and developing countries!\n  \u2026 but there\u2019s more!\nBITalino is community-driven: One of the strengths of BITalino is the vibrant community; from box designs for 3D printing, to accessories and APIs, this project is bringing together people around body signals. With your pledge we\u2019ll be able to take this BITalino (r)evolution even further\nBITalino gives power to the people: With it\u2019s a convenient all-in-one modular design, BITalino was already in a league of its own, by providing seamless access to tools that typically come with a hefty price tag! Back us, and your contribution will be used to make BITalino even more affordable both as a kit and through the application-specific boards.\nBITalino lets your imagination set the limit: Each individual block can be snapped off and easily combined to prototype anything. You can connect other sensors or interfaces, including your own custom designs.\nBITalino has an open-source friendly design: The hardware uses standard interfaces (UART, Bluetooth, SPI, ...); our software is open-source and fully supported by web-based technologies for maximum flexibility (HTML, CSS, JS).\nBITalino has two main components; the hardware and the software. Below is the main technical information for the full-spec kit:\nSampling Rate: up to 1000Hz\nAnalog Inputs: 4 @ 10-bit + 2 @ 6-bit + 1 @ 6-bit dedicated to the battery level\nAnalog Outputs: 1 @ 8-bit\nDigital Ports: 4 @ 1-bit\nSensors: EMG + ECG + EDA + ACC + LUX (interchangeable and expandable with future sensors)\nActuators: LED + PWM driver\nConnectivity: Bluetooth Low Energy (interchangeable with other interfaces)\nInterfaces: UART + SPI\nBattery: 500mAh 3.7V LiPo single cell (interchangeable with higher capacity alternatives)\nWeight: 20 g\nSize: 60 mm x 50 mm\nSoftware: Multiplatform APIs & SDKs, Firmware, Real-time visualisation & recording, and many other useful tools\nAnatomy of a BITalino (r)evolution\nLaunch: We embark on a global BITalino (r)evolution to take the creation of wearables, quantified self apps, or medical devices to the next level\n$50K: This is our primary goal... back us and help make the BITalino (r)evolution kits, Application-specific boards, Blocks available as individual components, and Improved cabling.\n$75K: Help us go beyond our 1st stretch goal, and you\u2019ll enable the release of the Memory card accessory, Additional sensors, Body signal processing algorithms, and Learning materials.\n$100K: Show your love by helping us reach our 2nd stretch goal, and you\u2019ll be making BITalino history by enabling us to create a version in Printoo\u2019s Arduino based paper-thin flexible technology, as well as a Galvanically isolated USB accessory.\nDo-it-yourself (DiY) hardware toolkits have created a global revolution in the way that digital interfaces interact with the physical world. From twitter-controlled Christmas trees to bicycle jacket turn signal lights, this movement is driving endless innovations and stimulating an age of creative engineering and innovative disruption. \u201cBody signals\u201d largely remain unexplored within this domain\u2026 at least with the attention and focused effort we believe they deserve.\nBITalino seeks to extend the principles of physical computing to the domain of body signals, and forever change the way projects and applications in this space are made. The team behind the project has a combined total of 60+ years of experience in the field of body signal hardware and software tools, together with an extensive track record in the successful launch of award-winning products in the professional segment (e.g. physioplux and ergoplux).\nBITalino (r)evolution is the brainchild of PLUX - Wireless Biosignals, S.A. and joint work with IT - Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es. Established in 2007, PLUX is a multidisciplinary company specialised in creating innovative biomedical hardware and software technologies for healthcare and research professionals.

I listened very carefully your comments and suggestions and improved my visual system a lot. \nThe Interactive \"Learn Python VISUALLY\" is the result of that.\nI must admit that I have great conviction in this project and completely believe that it will be of benefit to many who wish to learn and understand the basics of programming. \nI hope that you are just as excited as I am about this project and that you feel the urge to help others by becoming a backer right now. \nNot only will you be of help to me, but to thousands of others as well, who have tried and given up in despair on learning the Python language. \nPRE-ORDER HERE:\npythonvisually.com\nShow your love and support for code and make this eBook a success!\nTHANK YOU for supporting this project, I can't wait to show you what you can learn from this eBook.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has successfully delivered on time the first project.

Despite all the marketing hype, 99% of ordinary sunglasses \u2013 regardless of price \u2013 are nothing more than colored lenses in frames.  Those frames can be fancy \u2013 or sexy \u2013 or branded with some famous name \u2013 or they might be very ordinary frames from WallyWorld or CheapCo.  But when it comes to the lenses, they are basically all the same.  Generally speaking, there is no performance difference that matters in any meaningful way.  However, now you will have the chance to own sunglasses with a proven, unique and patent-powered performance difference that can actually be experienced.    \nIntroducing ORION4Sight \"Sunglasses on Steroids.\"\nOur ORION4Sight sunglasses are a spin-off version of patented ORION Optical Eyewear Filters used by the U.S. Military and are specifically formulated to provide an enhanced vision experience that has been independently evaluated \u2013 and which easily surpass polarized lenses or anything else available anywhere.    \nWhat is the PROOF that ORION4Sight Sunglasses are so special?\nThe proof that ORION4Sight sunglasses are something different, unique and special is firmly anchored in their American military heritage.    \nOur Company has been successfully selling products using our patented ORION Vision Technologies to elite U.S. Special Operations Commands for almost two decades.  We have 4 patents issued and are \u201cRegistered\u201d to sell ORION Technologies to the U.S. Government.\nNavy Seals and other Special Force Operators regularly use our ORION Optical Filter Eyewear.  If you knew the details about the missions on which our eyewear has accompanied them, your hair would literally stand on end!  We have stacks of personal testimonials.  Here is just one example.\n\u201cThe main thing I was doing was small boat operations in the bay during bright and sunny weather.  The ORIONs worked great!  Even in direct sunlight, I never had to squint and thus never got a headache.  This is an awesome advantage in my line of work.\u201d (Navy Seal Name With-Held To Protect Confidentiality)\nAnd here is another testimonial from a former Marine with personal experience using the ORION technology:\nFinally, we have a testimonial from John Hanson, an experienced sailor who publishes a well-regarded nautically-oriented magazine.\nWho can BENEFIT from using ORION4Sight Sunglasses?   \nAlmost everyone who goes outside in bright sunlight wears sunglasses.  So ORION4Sight Sunglasses are for EVERYONE.  They are specifically designed for people who engage in outdoor leisure activities and sports \u2013 and would like to experience a higher level of enjoyment and performance.  Here is just a partial list of sports and activities where ORION4Sight can improve that enjoyment and performance \u2013 driving, cycling, hiking, fishing, sailing, flying, boating, tennis, golf and all forms of sport-shooting.  The potential list is really endless and limited only by your imagination.    \nHere are the BENEFITS of ORION4Sight Sunglasses\nDistinct Image Contrast\nImproved Image Crispness\nProvides accurate and improved color saturation\nReduces eyestrain\nUnisex wrap-around frames which block unfiltered light from reaching the eye\nPowered by patents proven to improve human vision under extreme lighting conditions\nThese pictures show persons wearing the military version of Orion eyewear.  \nORION Eyewear benefits cannot be replicated with traditional dark lenses.  The bottom line BENEFIT is that ANYONE who wears ORION4Sight \u201cSunglasses On Steroids\u201d will experience enhanced vision designed to increase their performance and enjoyment of outdoor activities and sports.  We are confident that ORION4Sight Eyewear will outperform any traditional sunglasses.\nHOW Does It Work?\nWell that\u2019s sort of a secret, isn\u2019t it?  That is why we have important patents in place.  We are not unlike the famous Coca-Cola Formula.   Many have tried to \u201ccrack our code\u201d, but none have succeeded \u2013 and we\u2019re not talking!\nWHY Does It Work?\nThe diagram below tells that story.\n WHY are we asking for your support?\nWe are honoring requests from our American Soldiers NOT to provide the Military ORION Technology to foreign countries and/or consumer markets. However, we have made certain changes to the core ORION Technology which makes the new ORION4Sight sunglasses vision technology available to you.  We will also have legal expenses as we acquire a necessary new patent. This all costs money \u2013 and we need to keep some capital reserves available for an important new Project we are working on for our military.\nRather than borrow money, we have initiated this Crowdfunding Campaign on Kickstarter to raise the necessary capital to make the ORION4Sight project possible right now.    \nWHY should you support our Campaign?\nWe have something uniquely special, different, and better \u2013 and we know it.  And our American Soldiers know it.  Because of our decades-long commitment to their welfare and the new upcoming Project we mentioned above, we could put our ORION4Sight project on the back-burner \u2013 and delay this Goal.  But no one will benefit from that.  You can play an instrumental role in bringing these ground-breaking \u201cSunglasses On Steroids\u201d to the consumer marketplace NOW by supporting our Campaign.\nWhat do you receive for supporting our Kickstarter Campaign?\nAs the \u201creward\u201d for your support, you can effectively acquire a single or multiple pairs of ORION4Sight sunglasses for a price that will NEVER BE LOWER or repeated again ANYWHERE.  When these sunglasses become commercially available, their price will be significantly higher \u2013 as is appropriate for a product with such a proven performance difference.\nAnd you will be among the first to own these extraordinary, \u201cBest In Class\u201d sunglasses.  People will say to you, \u201cThose look interesting.  Let me try them.\u201d  And when they do, they will ask, \u201cWHERE did you get those?!  I want a pair!\u201d  (Be careful about lending them out.  You may have trouble getting them back!  We\u2019ve learned this the hard way.)\nIf you choose a pair of the ORION4Sight sunglasses as your reward, you will receive the sunglasses themselves, a protective case to keep them safe, a brief Instruction booklet telling you how best to use and enjoy your Orions, and a box to keep everything in.\nThe result of your support is \u2013 you will own The Best Darn Sunglasses Ever \u2013 and you will have played an important role in helping to make that possible for yourself and others.  This is WIN - WIN for everyone    \nA WORD to those who wear prescription eyewear. \nWe do not offer prescription lenses, fit-overs, or clip-ons at this time. It is not possible to address this issue within the parameters of this Kickstarter Campaign. We will be working on this in the future. However meanwhile, consider that you may have family and friends who can benefit from our sunglasses - and enjoy them.\nA SPECIAL NOTE to our supporters in the community of Amazon Sellers.\nAt the end of our Campaign, we will prepare a detailed Report on our Kickstarter Campaign.  It will cover all the relevant details and lessons-learned from our Campaign.  This will be made available to any Amazon Seller who would like to have a Copy.    \nYou can help to insure the success of our Campaign and thus insure delivery of YOUR ORION4Sight sunglasses.   \nLike you, your family and friends wear sunglasses when they go outside. You might want to think of getting an extra pair or two as gifts for someone special.  But either way, you can help insure the success of the Campaign by telling others about it \u2013 and that success will insure delivery of your own ORION4Sight sunglasses.  Pass this web \u201clink\u201d on to others.  Just like you, they can benefit from owning the best sunglasses they will ever wear.  Tweet (#SunglassesOnSteroids), text, phone, post on Facebook and other Social Media you use, email \u2013 and basically communicate this to others in whatever way works best for you.  Help knowledge of these \u201cSunglasses On Steroids and this great offer to go \u201cVIRAL\u201d in all the communities to which you belong.\nWe also encourage you to follow our Kickstarter Campaign by going to our Facebook Page:  www.facebook.com/orion4sight.  By clicking the \u201clike\u201d button there, and interacting with the Page, you can further help to \u201cspread the word\u201d.    \nThe choice is yours. \nYou can continue to use ordinary sunglasses that have NO performance difference.  And you could choose to over-pay for nothing more than \u201ccolored lenses in fancy frames\u201d.  OR you can play an instrumental role in bringing these revolutionary sunglasses to the marketplace \u2013 and experience documented vision enhancement powered by patented technology like Navy Seals use.  When you own a pair of ORION4Sight \u201cSunglasses On Steroids\u201d, you will see things you never saw before.\nChoose your \u201creward\u201d for supporting us from the choices to the right of the screen and be among the first to experience the benefits of this revolutionary technology.
