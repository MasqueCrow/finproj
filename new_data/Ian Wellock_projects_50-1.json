We want to get you the best game possible so for the final push: ALL BACKERS GET ALL PLANNED (& unannounced) REWARDS if we reach $30,000!  UNLOCKED!!\nThis means EVERYONE gets:\nUpgraded to the full core game of 80 Invention Cards!\nUpgraded core game to include 300 Hilarious Pitch Prompt Cards!\nWith Massive Gratitude - Stacy  \nWHAT THE WHAT?! is a 3-10 person party game where players compete to invent outrageous new uses for genuine old time inventions.\nFeaturing audacious attempts, fantastic fails and clever contraptions from the world's patent archives.\nThere are Self Saluting Hats, Rocking Chair Bathtubs, Flying Machines and a few that would likely kill you.\nResearchers from the Smithsonian and White House Historical Association have spent hours curating 100 inventions from circa 1581 to today. \nWe brought this game to Kickstarter because its curious community rises up to support the bold, outlandish creators today. We believe many of you would have backed these incredible inventions.\nWhether it was a lack of access to funding, cultural constraints or an inability to share their message widely, the majority of these inventions, never got past the patent or prototype stage. With your help we can now bring them to life!\nOur beautifully illustrated Digital Booklet deep dives into the journey and motivations of some of the Inventors who, in our opinion, didn't fail, but inspire us with their try. \nMore exciting Stretch Goals planned! Become a backer to help unlock! \nTo unlock voting for which Illustration Card makes it to the final deck go to each social channel and follow us!  Once we hit our goals voting begins! \n\nThese are shipping estimates. Shipping will be added after the campaign in the pledge manager. The game is being manufactured in China and then shipped to the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia for fulfillment. There's currently a bottleneck in shipping containers driving overseas shipping costs way up. We'll keep all the backers in the loop as we learn more. Thanks for understanding. We are working hard to ship you these games at the lowest possible cost!\n Europe Zone 1: Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands\n Europe Zone 2: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus (South), Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland\n Asia Zone 0: China, Hong Kong, Macao\n Asia Zone 1:  Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam\nDue to shipping fees and logistics, we are not able to ship to the following geographies at this time: Brazil, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Russia, Ukraine, Middle East, North Korea, Africa, South America.\n\nVAT - Because of the new laws and changes happening in some parts of the world, VAT will be added in the pledge manager. Depending on where backers are from, we will be collecting the appropriate VAT percentage based off of the total cost of the pledge. For the EU, UK, USA, Canada, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we plan to ship from within these zones, meaning backers shouldn't incur customs charges.\n\nBailey Katz, Paul Katz, Leona & Ronald Katz, Jody Katz, Olivia Pritikin, Ben Pritikin, Joel Pritikin, Marty Shapiro, Shapiro Family, Elizabeth Umanzor, Betty Sosa, Carlos Pantano, Egerman/Nemoy Family, Audpop, Paige Williams, Yarrow Kraner, Tanya Thompson, Mary Couzin, Ramy Badie, Lynn Casey, Anita Landgraf, Tony Serebriany, Josh West, Hosanna Fox, Peyton Lovett, Britt Lovett, Lainie Etzioni, Mary Anne Richman, Carly McGinnis, Daniel Selleck, Jennifer Giambrone, Peggy Brown, David Begler, Devi Brown, Scout Willis, Will Christiansen, Scott Vierick, Dina Ramse, Kobi Yamada, Emily Chang, Lindsey Henn, Leslie Pierson, USM Family, Hatch Family, Sherre Hirsch, Reproject Team, AdMagic & Blackbox Team.\n This project is promoted by Jellop,  the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,400+ successful  Kickstarter projects with over $500M raised in total.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nThanks for checking out our Campaign! The following is meant to set expectations as it relates to this project and Kickstarter's terms of use. It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer. By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, content of the rewards, and the project are subject to change.\n\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address, and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. Until you confirm your pledge, we have no way of identifying which rewards you want to receive or where you wish to receive them. If you do not confirm your rewards in the pledge manager within 3 months of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Well Why Not Media has fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We are a small company and must have a fair timeframe in which to fulfill the games and shipping. \n\nWe work with world-class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out-of-date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is needed.\n\nThat said, even with world-class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If a part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged, we will provide free replacement parts for as long as we have them available. If a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of a reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\n\nOur sincere goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell What the What?! game at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release What the What?! game to retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete. We are so grateful to you, our backers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith over 6 years of growing my first card game I co-created called Not Parent Approved from a friends and family Kickstarter to becoming a best seller card game on Amazon, I understand what it takes to bring this game to market. Production of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straight forward product to make. The biggest challenge would actually be if you blow us out of water. But we are ready to do this!\n\nWe are using the incredible game veterans at AdMagic to print the game- the ones that handled the scale, quality and professionalism of Exploding Kittens, Cards Against Humanity and many more to Kickstarter backers. The awesome teams at Blackbox will fulfill and send out the games to you once they are printed.\n\nWe recognize that COVID or shipping issues cause some logistic challenges. We are committed to keeping you updated!

In case of them not being active, they must be carried in the Item Bag taking up one space.\nThe player that uses more than one spell must choose which one to use when their action is performed.\nSkills\nBefore performing any action, the player must decide whether to use or not the Skill.\nThe Skill, just like Spells, will cost Power and the player will benefit from its stats when attacking.\nElite and Boss Skills\nThe deck corresponding to the enemy is prepared.\nA card is revealed each turn of the enemy and that card\u2019s action is performed.\nIf the Skill persists through various turns, the card is put aside, placing Time markers each turn of the enemy until the effect disappears.\n\n\nAs promised on the campaign comments, here is a video of the game captured on TableTop Simulator (TTS). Due to the current Co-VID situation, inviting unvaccinated people from outside JanduSoft, and without an antigen or PCR test would be irresponsible on our part, so that is why we decided to record the game using TTS instead of our printed prototype.\n\nInitially, our idea was having this video uploaded a couple of days ago, but we had an issue with OBS and we did not record the correct audio output, so the only voice in the video was that of the host of the game, and not the four invited players. So last night we gathered four players that worked with us on another playing test session, and this is the game we have uploaded.\nTablet Top Simulator gameplay of MiniQuest Adventures\nTake a look at the video here.\n\nOnce again, since this project has escalated so much, we didn\u2019t have time to script the TTS because it was not our priority, and the game is in a non updated version that we use for testing.\n\nNonetheless, we considered that it would be good to share this TTS game with our community so you can give us all the feedback you can. So the game will be available on the TTS workshop. (An early version, without the extras we have added throughout the campaign). If someone is interested in scripting it, please contact us. \n\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures on Tabletop Simulator\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures here\nThis is not the final version, and has been cut by hand, so we can assure you that although it looks good, the final product will be much better. The colors might be different to the final ones since the prototype has been printed in matte, and the final version will be printed in glossy paper.\nWhen we have the final prototype in our hands we will post an update on the campaign to show the difference in the current finishes and the final ones, and also show you the size of the game inside the box-\nA lot of things inside the box\nTypical game setup\nPLAY\n\n*Handcrafting the prototype tokens\nDiscover the Heroes\n\n\nMartina is a Human Sorceress that takes advantage of her great power to cast devastating spells.\nHer innate ability will allow her to recover power as long as there are enemies nearby.\nDurlan is a relentless Explorer Elf that will take advantage of his movement to get out of harm's way when convenient.\nHis innate ability will allow him to deal deadly blows to his enemies.\nFaenala is a Dwarf Paladin that will do all it takes to protect her companions.\nHer innate ability will allow her to charge at her enemies although wearing a crude and heavy armor.\nRalen is a combat-skilled Human Barbarian seeking glory for his tribe.\nHis innate ability will all allow him to strike multiple enemies with a single attack.\n\n\nIf you like what you see, tell people about it!\nSpreading the word about the game is the best way to help it achieve the kind of success needed for me to produce more material and products for it. \n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\nBecome a Fan on BoardGameGeek \n Retweet & Like on Twitter \n Share & Like on Facebook \n Like & Comment on Instagram \nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again as our pledge manager to help with your pledge and process accurate shipping fees.

The sleeves that come with the game are not only essential for gameplay, they also help increase the lifespan of the cards. Canvas was designed with expansions in mind, so that Canvas: Reflections and future expansions will not require unnecessary duplicate printing of base game components.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer, PandaGM, will produce replacement components so that damaged or missing pieces can be replaced with a small shipment instead of a second copy of the game, saving gas and materials. Canvas components are stored in reusable storage bags. The box efficiently holds all game pieces and add-ons without wasted space from a plastic insert.\nSustainable materials\nThe box and punchboard are made from 30% recycled materials for the ideal blend of durability and sustainability. The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic. The packing cartons are 100% recycled paper pulp.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPandaGM recycles all plastic and paper waste. The factory is fully air-conditioned for worker comfort and has passed ISO worker health and safety standards, is BSCI social compliance certified, and follows the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.

Everdell is easy to learn, yet offers satisfying strategic depth and endless replayability.\n\nWill the sun shine brightest on your city?\nArtist impression of prototype components. Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Just pledge for the Kickstarter Edition (or, if you're feeling swaggy, the Collector's Edition) and you too can join the ranks of Red Dragon Inn fans around the world!\n\nFarai is a high-ranking cleric of the Great Temple, but his first love is brewing. His brewery and tasting room, The Harmonious Cup, is a part of the Great Temple and not only brews the sacramental wine, but also helps pay for the temple's many charitable works!\nSamantha runs The Scurvy Dog, a feisty tavern down by the docks. Fights break out there so frequently that Samantha decided to start taking bets on their results. Her quick wits and business savvy have turned her \"low class\" establishment into a bustling destination!\nLucky owns a \"booze cart\" that travels around town selling spirits and avoiding trouble with the city guard. She sources her alcohol in various... \"creative\" ways. Whenever some ale is approaching its expiration date, Lucky is there. Whenever a barrel of Dwarven Firewater falls off the back of a warehouse, Lucky is there. Whenever a local thief needs an item fenced, Lucky is there. (But that's the part of her business she doesn't want you to know about!)\nA highly skilled barista and baker, Phyll runs Startusk's, a coffee shop just across from the main entrance to the Mages' Collegium. Many Greyporters thought that it would be folly to open a shop that only serves snacks, high-end drinks and potions, but the line out the door every morning proves those naysayers wrong.\nNerodia is the clever and devious proprietor of The Black Dragon Depths, the tavern catering to the baddies and their henchfolk.

We know how to run a Kickstarter project, and when there are problems, we fix them. However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is nearly done! The only delays that could come here are a) if we notice something really bad in final playtest that we didn't see before, or b) one of our artists gets hit by a bus or something.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have a great relationship with our manufacturers and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise, such as global pandemics. 2020 gave us even more insight into the various things that can go wrong here, so we're facing 2021 even stronger than before.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Once games are manufactured, they need to be shipped from China to regional fulfillment partners, then from those fulfillment partners to you. Things can sometimes go very wrong in that seemingly-simple process. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Customs Delay: We have no control over the border policies of any country we import games into (including the US). Sometimes games get held up at a border - sometimes for a bafflingly long time.\n\n5. Alien Invasion Delay: Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our stated delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur games have long lifespans.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency. \n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason Bezier Games, Inc. will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order. \n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

To date, we\u2019ve raised enough as a company to donate over 60,000 games to kids. This campaign will help give even more! \nThe Newest Expansion to Nemo's War is Here! Featuring...\n A COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL & BETWEEN VOYAGES GUIDE: The new Operations Manual shows how to run the ship turn-by-turn and includes many useful appendices at the end, while the new Between Voyages Guide features instruction for setup, ending the game, scoring, epilogues, variants, and more!\n\n A NEW 2-PLAYER VERSUS VARIANT: Joining the riveting solo and cooperative modes where players command the Nautilus, in this game variant one player will play as the Imperialists, bent on its defeat. Includes special cards and 2 Imperial Squadron Miniatures!  \n\n A NEW CHARACTER TILE: Entering our story is Nemo\u2019s son, Nadeen Dakkar, who crosses paths with his father after hearing news of mysterious events at sea!\n\n NEW FINALE CARDS: Spice up your endings with The Trap, Imperialists\u2019 Catspaw, Scientific Espionage, and The Kraken! \n\n NEW STERN MOTIVES, ADDITIONAL NAUTILUS UPGRADES, AND EVEN MORE TOKENS & MARKERS! \nBrave the hazards of the seas, combat vessels around the globe, incite uprisings, chronicle amazing wonders, find mysterious treasures -- your quest knows no bounds in this Ultimate Edition. Combining all expansion content, including the Journey\u2019s End Expansion, both new and returning players will be able to experience everything Nemo\u2019s War has to offer. Play solitaire, cooperatively, or competitively; the choice is yours!\n\nEach turn, you must address the seas\u2019 challenges in a grand adventure, confront the growing pressure of the Imperialist powers\u2019 navies, undertake Actions with the Nautilus and her crew \u2013 all while maintaining Captain Nemo\u2019s spirit to continue.  The Turn Sequence is as follows:\n\nBegin each turn in the Event Phase by flipping an event, Test, or other card from the Adventure Deck. Favorably resolving Tests, and using resources to manipulate your die rolls in this pursuit, will be critical to securing a victory no matter what your motive is.\nRoll high, captains, but be careful: your mission ends in Defeat if you deplete a Ship Resource. Developing an understanding of the probabilities, risks, and rewards for each Test and to what degree will ultimately be the reason for your mission\u2019s success or failure.\nNext is the Placement Phase, where you roll the dice for this round\u2019s Oceans for Ship token placement based on the game\u2019s current Act and your Notoriety. Strategic choices about where to place your ships, what we call \u201cpainting the board,\u201d will be crucial to your plans! Which Oceans to populate (and, through combat, denude) is the vital strategic chess game you are playing with the Imperialist powers who oppose you.\n You also receive the Differential Roll result of the two (selected) white dice rolled in Action Points for that turn. If the two (selected) white dice are doubles, a Lull Turn takes place..\n  Now it\u2019s time to act! During the Action Phase, you spend your Action Points to Move, Attack, Search for Treasure, Incite Uprisings, and more, all to advance Nemo\u2019s goals.\nAlways remember: you are questing for the greatest number of Victory Points (VPs) that you can acquire, as modified by Captain Nemo\u2019s Motive, while avoiding the many ways to suffer defeat. BVPs are earned in several ways (e.g., sinking enemy ships, passing TEST Events, collecting Treasures, inciting oppressed peoples, making scientific discoveries, etc), so choose your actions wisely each turn, and beware: \n Your mission ends in Defeat if your adventures gain too much notoriety, as you become an international Pariah to be hunted down mercilessly.\n\nRepeat these Phases until the game ends with your early defeat or you reveal the Final\u00e9 card that ultimately instructs you: \u201cThe game ends!\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done, read the epilogue to your voyage in the Between Voyages Guide. Your level of victory and motive will change the story of your Journey\u2019s End.\n\nHere's a Preview and How to Play video for The Ultimate Edition from the Game Boy Geek:\nYou can also check out this How to Play from Meeple University with designer & developer Alan Emrich!

If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific local taxes, or other charges.

Shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager.\nWe are only shipping to the following countries, due to shipping uncertainties and restrictions:\nIf you back this campaign and request fulfillment to somewhere outside of these countries, we will cancel your order and refund your pledge per our Refund Policy (90% of the total you pledged).\n\nWe do anticipate that these products will be available through our online stores around the world so if you cannot participate in this campaign, you should be able to order them through those in the future.\n\nTaxes\nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies!

Allow us to run you through the story so far...\nThe Game of Deep Space Adventure\nThe second game in the Escape the Dark series, Escape the Dark Sector is a simple, sci-fi adventure game for 1 to 4 players with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling and player cooperation. It takes just a few minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and each mission is randomly generated so no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nAlong the way, the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, traps, and terrors. From cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms, with each challenge represented by a large, lavishly illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of tactical dice combat and timely use of item cards to complete them.\nThe goal of the game is to recover your starship by completing every chapter in the mission deck and defeating the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately.\nRead:\n\"A blast from start to finish - 5/5\u201d -WhatCulture\n\"An awesome box full of Space Drama!

Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to a chunky, metal, 'Acting Captain' token. \nNo space crew would be complete without an android or Cyborg. At this level of funding a new android member of the crew along with their crew die will be added to the contents of The Collector's Box.\nAn app to track the health of crew members, replacing the medical records/health trackers with app featuring atmospheric sound and animation to compliment the tabletop experience. This will be free to all backers of this campaign, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items - we're learned the hard way that software takes a LONG time to get right. You can check out what we're doing with the Castle app here. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Sector will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign - we've learned the hard way that software takes a LONG time to get right. \nHow does it work?\nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply add-up the value of all the add-ons you want and then pledge that amount on top of the cost of your chosen pledge. At the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to see exactly how much you pledged, add more funds if you wish, and then browse the following items in your own time to select exactly which ones you want to get.\nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the estimates shown on the charts in our Shipping section. We'll calculate your shipping total in Backerkit at the end of the campaign (based on the total weight of your order).\nImportant note: \nMany of the items in this section are already available for immediate shipping on our website (excluding bundles). If you order these items as add-ons they will ship with your pledge rewards when this campaign fulfils in 2021 so that everything arrives together. \nAdd-ons for Escape the Dark Sector\nPlanning on getting a Level 4 or Level 5 pledge?

This perfect family game is packed with choices that will keep your brain running at full steam.\nThe core of the game lies in completing puzzles with pieces. Completed puzzles give you points as well as extra pieces to use. The more pieces you have, the more difficult (and valuable!) puzzles you may try to complete.\nYou start the game with just two little pieces, and on your turn, you can do three actions (you may do the same action repeatedly):\nTake a new puzzle\nGet a new small piece or upgrade a piece that you have\nPlace a piece on your puzzle\nMaster action (only once every round) \u2014 put a piece on all your puzzles!\nOptimize your actions so that your engine grows rather than runs out of steam. Quick development is crucial since once players have taken all the valuable (black) puzzles, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. \nWith the Finesse expansion, you can complete goals on Finesse tiles to earn Credits. You can then spend the Credits to do extra actions.\nThe Ghost Piece expansion adds 24 new puzzles with unique shapes and new reward mechanics. There are also 3 new types of level-5 pieces, the Ghost Pieces. This expansion enhances the replayability of Project L and opens new strategic options for you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Add-ons? To get the add-ons, click on the Manage your pledge button. Then, click on Change your pledge and increase your pledge amount by the total cost of the add-ons you want. You will be able to select the add-ons you have pledged for in the pledge manager when the campaign ends.\n\nThe Boardcubator Ambassador Program is our way of thanking all the wonderful people in our community who stayed with us throughout the campaigns and whose support and help keep us moving forward. It\u2019s because of your continuous involvement and interest in our games that we amass enough energy and motivation to push our projects further ahead. As a thank you, we\u2019re including a special promo pack in all our Kickstarter campaigns that our ambassadors get for free!\nYou will automatically receive Project L: Finesse Ambassador Pack for free if:\nYou have pledged during the first 72 hours of the campaign,\nYou have supported any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns, or\nYou were subscribed to our newsletter before this Kickstarter campaign launched.\n\n  Looking back to the original campaign in 2018, Project L went a long way. Two years ago, thanks to the support of all the amazing backers, we've fully unlocked all Stretch Goals that allowed us to produce the game in a shape and quality we had never dreamed of. There's not much that could be added or upgraded \u2014 just look at what the backers and reviewers say!\nWhen it comes to the Finesse expansion, we had no other option than to follow the quality of Project L & Ghost Piece (not that we wouldn't like that), so Finesse is already coming to Kickstarter in a super-maximized mode.\nWe prefer to not add anything superficial, untested, or not fitting the content that's been originally planned for the game. And since mostly everything has been already added to the game, the inevitable result is that this campaign is Stretch Goal free.\nOn the other hand, the journey towards making Project L a reality has been so exciting that we just love the idea of sharing it with you in full detail (in even more detail than that the backers of the original campaign remember!). To accomplish that, we\u2019ve prepared a series of behind-the-scenes stories as well as making-of interviews.\nStay tuned for the project updates!\nSince the original campaign from 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with Paul Grogan from Gaming Rules!, a professional rulebook writer & editor, to enhance and streamline the way you can learn to play Project L. Furthermore, focusing on the feedback we\u2019ve received since the first version of the game, we\u2019ve also perfected the rules in terms of game mechanics\u2014mostly concerning the player actions and endgame. \nCheck out the Revised Rules 2.0 (WIP).\nPrinted Revised Rulebook (2.0):\n comes automatically with all pledge levels! So, if you're a backer of the original campaign and are now pledging for the Returning Backer rewards (just the Finesse expansion), you'll receive the physical revised rulebook 2.0 as well.\nincludes the rules of Project L (base game) and all expansions in a single book.\nincludes updated player aids,\nis printed on premium soft-touch paper (that you know from the original campaign).\nis available in English only (see below for more details).\nWe're proud to announce that Asmodee will localize and manufacture Project L (base game) and also distribute it in retail.\nIf you're interested in a localized retail version of the base game, get in touch with your local branch of Asmodee for details about if/when they are releasing Project L in your country and/or language. Since the localization is now in the hands of Asmodee, we're no longer allowed to produce non-English versions of the game.\nPlease note, however, that the retail version by Asmodee and this Kickstarter version by Boardcubator are two separate product lines run by two separate companies. While there's a good chance that the content of one will be compatible with the other, we cannot guarantee that.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager.\nFriendly Shipping \u2014 We offer friendly shipping to the EU, US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Backers from these regions won't spend additional money on customs or other import fees. Based on any given region, we will either ship your reward directly from within the country or will fully cover all potential import fees you might get charged for. \nAdditional Copy Shipping Discount \u2014 If you're interested in getting an additional copy of Project L or one of the expansion, you will spare on shipping for the subsequent copy thanks to reduced rates.

Rulebooks, game boxes, player aids, and puzzle boards have scratch resistant varnish or lamination that ensures that these components will last a long time under frequent use. Based on hundreds of rounds of playtesting, we have gradually improved the technological aspect of puzzle boards into their current 5-layer structure.\n\nThe base game is readily expandable without the need to make any component changes or upgrades to the base game that would require releasing a new version of the game. All expansions of the game can be mixed together.\nReusability and recyclability\nGiven the durability and material quality of the components in the game, Project L will last a long time before it starts showing signs of use or general material deterioration.

Controlled by a mysterious individual, these elongated worms tirelessly dig underground tunnels, causing swathes of territory to sink into the bowels of the earth. \nAfter years of helplessness, the Protectorate finally found a defense against this scourge in the Necrodruids \u2013 men and women who rejected the sacred principles of the Druidic Order to draw upon blood and forbidden incantations. The Necrodruids used their blood rituals to create monstrous plant-creatures capable of combating the Burrowers.\nIn the Citadels, the Necrodruids\u2019 power centers, YOU grow and tend to the abominations developed within, whose seeds are then spread all over the world to protect the territory against the Burrowers. Working as a slave-gardener, you wish that a fatal accident or death by exhaustion would relieve you of your endless toil.\nThe world has clearly changed since the days of your forefathers. The Collapsing Lands are choked in gloom and dust belched up by the Burrowers. The horrific plant-creatures that were created to protect you have spread, sometimes out of control, and are now just as much of a threat to humanity as the Burrowers.\nOn a cold morning bathed in pale light, you awaken for another long day of hard labor in the sacred grove, unaware that this will be your last day at the Citadel and that the course of history is about to change...\n\nSolo or cooperative game for up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure per Threat.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where you are the hero!\nNo die rolls: the more energy you spend, the more you increase your chances of success, but the faster you burn out!\nLive a different adventure every time; there are countless surprises and the game remembers your choices!\nEarn new skills, unlock bonuses, construct buildings: your decisions determine your path. Choose your destiny!\nIn The 7th Citadel, you face a Threat which will inevitably come down on you (unless you perish before you get there!).\nEach Threat comes in the form of a booklet with several scenarios that follow one another, until the final scenario where you either win the game or succumb to the Threat.\nUnlike most board games, you will experience an adventure over time, but rest assured, a simple save system allows you to pause your game at any time to resume it later.\nYou are a slave-gardener, captive of The 7th Citadel for several years now.\nYou start the game by choosing one of the available characters. Each character has an optional quest and a personal Action Deck.\nCasek, female (front) and male (back) version of a playable character\nCasek's personal quest\nAs your adventure progresses, you will choose new skills to create the character YOU want to play. Far from the usual archetypes of warrior, mage, and healer, you will have the freedom to develop your character as you choose.\nAre you more into Cunning or Arcana?\nWhether you want to play a teenage arcane master with a slingshot, an eloquent adventurer who can sneak through the shadows, or an elderly swordsman who summons creatures to assist him in battle, the choice is yours!\nYou progress in the adventure by exploring the Collapsing Lands (the game board, made up of numbered cards).\nHere you undertake actions that usually result in taking numbered cards from the Adventure Deck to progress through the adventure. These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card.

Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 20 years, in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign.

To date, we have delivered rewards to over 60,000 backers around the world.\n\nWe have accumulated experience and selected our partners (manufacturer, logistics, distribution centers) among the best in the world, so we are confident in our ability to deliver this project and ensure its follow-up (communication with the community, after-sales service) with the same professionalism that we have shown so far.\n\nThe main risk factor, which can never be excluded given the complexity of such a project and the potential number of backers, lies in a possible delay in delivery.\n\nCOMMITMENTS\n\nBecause you place your trust in us and allow us, through your support, to bring our project to life, we are keen to clarify our commitments to you.\n\nTo this end, we commit ourselves, as we have always done, to:\n\n1. not launch a new Kickstarter campaign until we have delivered the previous one.\n2. do everything possible to guarantee the sustainability of our company through sound management: control of its workforce, its operating costs and investments.\n3. ensure continuity as far as possible in the event of force majeure\n4. keep you informed with regular updates about the project until its delivery.\n\nWe would like to thank all our backers for the trust and support they have shown us since 2015!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\nIf the refund is requested more than 15 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 15% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Kickstarter.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll payments (pledged on Kickstarter and/or in the pledge manager) will be made in \u20acuros. Any costs shown in $ will be based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign (1$ = \u20ac0.85), the levy of your pledges and the pledge manager will be entirely in \u20acuros.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that you are responsible for providing correct address information, and ensuring that this address is deliverable by normal methods.

She finds inspiration in their imagination, and the dreamlike palette and lively brushwork that combine to create a wonderful atmosphere of enchantment. She believes that they sought to transport us to different worlds and fantastic places though their works. In her own work, known for its beautiful, enigmatic figures and lively creatures, Annie strives to depict this same transportive effect to the viewer. Her work is an exploration of the small hidden worlds that exist in our own backyards and the drama that unfolds with their unseen inhabitants. The secrets that are waiting to be discovered, and the mystery in a hidden moment of time. Annie exhibits her work in galleries and has done notable publishing work for clients such as Disney, Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast, Easton press, Netflix and more. Her work is found in private collections all over the world.\nGallery Gerard\nAnnie Stegg Illustration\nAnnie Stegg Fine Art (Facebook)\nAnnie Stegg Gerard (Instagram)\nShipping for this project's rewards will be collected afterwards via our Pledge Manager tool. We will do an Update when the tool is ready with exact shipping costs. This price will include all shipping, VAT, and customs and will include a subsidy from Forbidden Games that will cover a portion of these costs.\nBased on current rates, the cost/estimate of shipping a single copy of Lizard Wizard will be as follows: \n $10 in the USA \n $16 in the EU \n $16 in the UK* (*subject to Brexit) - We are looking into more info on Brexit - updates coming soon on possible options/solutions should this happen.\n Canada & China - we expect these to fall in the $20 - $25 range\n Oceania - (AUS/NZ/PHIL/JPN etc) - we expect these to fall in the $30 - $40 range\n Other countries prices will vary from $35 - $55 depending on your location (most will fall in the $35 - $45 range, but the high cost to some destinations is outside our control)\nAdditional games ordered will ship immediately after the campaign ends (no waiting), and will have similar first item pricing, and reduced costs for additional items*\n*subject to supply in your shipping area.\nExample: A Lizard Wizard pledge to the USA, and 3 additional items from the sale we estimate would look like: $10 for the first item sent, and $5 each additional item on the immediate shipping, and $10 for the Lizard Wizard shipment later. \nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Russia, Africa, South America, Mexico, or the Middle East due to high postage prices, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company. We continue to work with different fulfillment centers all over the world to ensure better and more affordable delivery each campaign but none will guarantee delivery to these countries.\nPLEASE NOTE THESE ARE JUST ESTIMATES.\nOur EU backers will see their rewards shipped from our EU fulfillment center on our first Wave of shipping. If you do not fill in your survey by the Wave 1 deadline (which will be sent in an update) we may have to send your reward from a different hub unless stock remains in the EU. We will try to fill all Wave 2 EU requests from our EU hub until stock is gone, but to ensure your reward ships to you from our EU center, please fill in your survey and Pledge Manager ASAP. All UK shipments are subject to Brexit effects.\nWe will be sending you all an invite to our Pledge Manager tool after the campaign ends and will do an update announcing its launch as well as when it locks down.

You can assume that we are hard at work making this project awesome!\nShipping: Shipping will be collected after the campaign via our Pledge Manager.

You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The Pledge Manager tool is a 3rd party product that we use to manage orders outside of Kickstarter.\nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nAs always, AEG does not make any profit on shipping & handling fees.

Shipping & handling for the order will be calculated at checkout. You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc. We won't try to figure out a break point where the shipping \"resets\" for a 2nd outer carton (or cartons); we'll just subsidize any marginal cost changes if the order is too big for one outer carton.\nEstimating additional shipping for Add-ons:\nGenerally speaking we are able to put Add-on components into the same master carton as the base Reward in your Pledge which makes them less expensive to ship than they would be if shipped individually. When you build your order in the Pledge Manager the system will generate a shipping & handling cost based on the weight, size, and taxes due for your order. Add-ons typically add a few dollars in shipping & handling cost, add-ons of whole games add about 50% of the base shipping cost.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\n\n                                      United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union + Norway and Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days).

AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited.

So it's no surprise that the construction of the station was riddled with problems. Funding cuts, shifting geopolitical climates, engineering setbacks - these were all just part of the job.

This spacewalk was supposed to be the final step, but a couple of faulty power cables forced the astronauts to abort. Of the six cables needed, two would not fully attach to the facility.

Just like us, the ISS crew had reason to celebrate the beginning of 2021.

The most recent event, on September 22nd, required a coordinated thruster burn by both US and Russian astronauts to ensure their safety.

As a company, we try to cater to the needs of gamers that want unique dice to suit their individuality.\nOne thing that always disappointed me though was that I could never find attractive eye-catching dice for when playing in non-English languages. Robin's Nerd Supplies is hoping to change that with the Talis Evolvere line. Talis Evolvere will include dice in a variety of languages and styles.

Player's take turns adding or swapping parts to their blade, putting up protection with shields, playing game changing gadgets, and attacking an opponent!

It will include three distinct themes:\nDeep Space (Sci Fi Themed)\nFaraway Land (Fantasy Themed)\nKickstarter Forge (Crowdfunding Themed)\nThe Kickstarter Forge theme will include blades that fans and backers of Reforge envisioned and our artist, Sam, made a reality! This continues my mission of getting the community involved with the creation of my games. Three of the blades in the final version of Reforge (The Narwhal, The Written Word, The Anthology) were actually conceived by Kickstarter backers!\nBy popular demand, we have added d12 blades! Forge even farther with these overpowered weapons of destruction! Oh, and did someone say gadgets? We've got some of the craziest gadgets ever in this expansion that are sure to shake up games. Details on all of the cards are below!\nStretch Goals!\nAnd how! I wanted to make this campaign more engaging to backers, so I upped the ante on stretch goals! Through these goals we will be able to add more blades and gadgets to the expansion pack, as well as create the super special Spirit Expansion! \nThe Spirit Expansion?!\nThe stretch goal of $9,000 will fund a smaller expansion that will add an entirely new gameplay mechanic to Reforge. The Spirit Expansion will let players who have fallen in battle continue to affect the course of the game! These special cards will be kept in a small deck separate from the Armory. When a player is defeated, they draw 3 and can use them whenever they want for the rest of the game! Help or hinder players that have helped or hindered you. I'm really excited about this expansion, so I hope we make it this far!

The production of Reforge last year took a little longer than expected and shipped in January, 2020 rather than the planned date of December, 2019.

Due to the different printer, the cards will have slight variation in shape and material. This works out well due to the nature of The Spirit Expansion - it will be kept completely separate from your current Reforge cards and even has a cool new backing.\nPlayers who have fallen in battle will now have the opportunity to change the course of the battle! The Spirit Expansion includes 15 brand new cards, each with a different effect that can be used on surviving players. When a player is defeated, they will draw 1-3 cards (depending on the number of remaining players) that can be used at any time for the remainder of the game.

Randomly generated levels and encounters make every playthrough a unique experience!\n A Thematic Roguelike Experience - An engaging game profoundly inspired by roguelikes and old-school dungeon crawlers. Every floor is randomly laid out, each game plays out differently, and of course, death is final.\nMinimal Setup - This game takes seconds to set up and makes for quick, tense dungeon romps.\nMake Choices - Will you spend your coins at the Merchant's stall for some health points, or choose to fight the Skeleton Soldier for some much-needed experience points before facing greater odds? Many more dilemmas await you!\nNew Co-op Mode - You can now enlist a fellow friend to help you out on the quest to retrieve the Og's Blood!\nBetter than Ever - Manipulations have been streamlined, the difficulty has been balanced, and new unique cards make for unexpected encounters.\nNew Characters  - Will you conjure powerful potions as the Mage, or play as the sneaky Rogue with deadly hands? Each Character comes with unique skills!   \nIf you want to pledge for additional content, you can see all the details in Add-ons and Shipping sections below.\n\n If you want to receive the Old Gods expansion with your additional copy of Mini Rogue, you can look to the Shipping section of this page (there is an explanation about how to add additional pledges like Leather Armor, Chainmail or Plate Armor).

This bonus goal has been unlocked! \nMy co-designer, Randy Scheunemann, and I set out to create a variety of dice games that offer interesting choices and give players some control over how the game plays out. Yes, even the randomness of dice games can include meaningful choices!\nWe spent months working with this goal in mind, we designed a ton of different games, and then we ultimately narrowed it all down to 26 that we feel are the best of the bunch. Those games are all featured in our book, Random Fun Generator \u2014 A Collection of Dice Games, which will be offered in an upcoming Kickstarter campaign from Steve Jackson Games.\nOne of those games, Liquid Courage, was designed specifically for Atlas Games, with the awesome custom dice from Dice Miner in mind, and we hope you enjoy it! \n\u2014 Sam Mitschke / Chief Creative Officer / Steve Jackson Games \nWe'll alert Dice Miner backers about the Random Fun Generator Kickstarter when it goes  live, but you can also monitor dice.sjgames.com, where the book will feature prominently when it launches. We're extremely happy to feature Liquid Courage as a stretch goal for Dice Miner backers.\nLiquid Courage is best played with six tunnel dice per player, but we're unlocking it with the fifth backer pack tunnel die because backers can still play it easily by using the 27 tunnel dice form their copies of Dice Miner.

(We understand that a Standard Edition pledge plus a deluxe dice set costs about the same as a Deluxe Edition pledge. It reflects what the dice cost, and the fact that you wind up with 120 dice instead of only 60.) Includes a Deluxe Edition dice bag.\nStandard Dice Set \u2014 $14. Available to everyone, added by popular demand. This is a full set of the sixty dice that come in the Standard Edition. Includes a Standard Edition dice bag.\nStandard-to-Deluxe Upgrade \u2014 $18. Available to backers at the \"Standard Group\" pledge level only. Each of these add-ons upgrades one of the five Standard Edition games that are part of that pledge level to a Deluxe Edition game.

We\u2019d call your attention especially to the backer updates for Magical Kitties Save the Day, to give you a sense of how we handle things and what we do when the unexpected arises. Past our previous Kickstarters, Atlas Games has been publishing tabletop games and making good on our promises for 30 years.\n\nAs a game, Dice Miner is complete. Its rules have been extensively tested, its components have been modeled, the art is all finished (with the exception of any new art required by unlocked stretch goals), and the graphic design is nearly done. We expect that Dice Miner will go to press before this campaign is over.\n\nAt the same time: Yes, indeed, many things seem very uncertain these days. There are definitely risks that COVID-19 will disrupt our supply chain or affect our staff members.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition.

The focus of this book by Deep Dungeon Games is the ground on which we stand - the earth itself and all the wonders it contains.\nThe Mineralogy Manual has been designed to be extremely easy to learn and use for any tabletop role-playing game, or the foundation for any type of fiction. It can be a fun addition to your long-running game or the start of a brand new short adventure. The book will come alive in your mind's eye through its beautiful and professional illustrations.\nThe Mineralogy Manual also includes a set of five complete adventures (using the 5th Edition ruleset), designed from the ground up to showcase the different aspects of the mineral and elemental resources showcased in the book. This provides an excellent introduction to many different systems and can act as the perfect starting point for a whole earthen or Dwarven campaign. These adventures are ready to run as soon as you get the book, including everything you\u2019ll need to craft your versions of named metal swords, armor, and other earthen devices.\nThe NPC cards from the Decks of Casual Characters offer a perfect complement to your copy of the book.\nThe book is expected to contain a whopping 400 to 450 pages. The exact number will depend on how many of the stretch goals are met since each will add significant text and imagery to the book. You really will get your money's worth! The Mineralogy Manual is filled to the brim, including sections on fantasy elements, minerals, ores, mines, mining companies, and even a fully developed Dwarven language.\nThe tome cards from the Deck of the Arbitrary Athenaeum offer a perfect complement to your copy of the book. Deal your player\u2019s real books from your world as they find new and exciting tales within them.\nThe book can be obtained as either a Digital or a Physical copy, with some tiers getting both versions. The Digital copy is DRM and watermark-free; the Physical copy is a hardcover 8.5\"x11\" book.\nIn the hope of giving you a bit of a summary, The Mineralogy Manual contains the following features, sections, and content to kickstart your underground adventure:\n Treasures of the Earth including 50 Elements, 40 types of Minerals, 30 types of Rocks and 20 types of Ores.\n The Crafting of the Earth including 20 varieties of Gemstones, 20 varieties of Crystals, and 20 types of Metals in all of its forms.\n Hollowing of the Earth including Magic Ley Lines, 10 fully detailed Mines, and 100 Non-Player Characters to fill up your fantasy mines.\n Children of the Earth, featuring 2,000 ready-to-use words in the Dwarven Language, 4 Dwarven Clans, 4 Dwarven Cities, 5 Earthen Dungeons, and 10 individual Natural Locations.\nAs the Kickstarter progresses, we will be adding the current goal and all the achieved goals right here! This is so you as the backer will have an easy time checking up on the progress and what goodies are next.\nThanks for checking out the Kickstarter. You can click here to download a free sample of Dwarven Dice Games and the Dwarven Inspired 5e Character Sheet! Thank you for spending the time and checking out the project! \nAll the features in this section comprise the entire earthen world and the treasures it holds. While some of these are rare, chaotic, or dangerous, they still mix and mold to make up all of the substances in the material realms. Everything comes from the true treasures of the earth and this chapter covers these treasures in their purest, raw forms. Gemstones, crystals, and rare metal ingots would never have been able to form without the true treasures below.\nElements are the source: the building blocks of all minerals, rocks, and everything else from the earth.\n Blighted Elements consist of Clode, Dune, Anima, and Conquitus. In most locations of the realms, it is thought these elements come from another universe or dimension where the laws of physics are slightly different, allowing them to be stable.\n Chaos Elements consist of Kindra, Granius, Halos, Aquifis, Vitae, Soros, and Thun. In most locations in the realms, they are rarely found due to their volatile nature with their own counter elements.\n Dwarven Elements consist of Claire, Fulg, Galvan, Fara, Flaris, Obasus, Lustrous, Thawe, Halo, Pulvi, Flaik, Scaldor, and Ragnis. Unlike chain metals, these metals are more often found in minerals than they are naturally.\n Foundation Elements consist of Coles, Magmith, Avalan, Lutum, Hydrox, Mores, Vox, Bron, Theron, and Monsoo. These elements are the most plentiful in the realms and mostly located in the ground.\n Rune Elements consist of Precipise, Eros, and Adum, and though found in many forms they are among the rarest. They are found naturally but more often take the form of minerals, crystals, and gemstones.\n Chain Metal Elements consist of Aflyx, Striutrium, Lobrese, Mashiydian, Espum, Nustum, and Lathian. These metals are found in minerals and rocks like many others but trace their origin back to the times of creation.\n Unseen Elements consist of Oxyn, Mistrath, Soleis, Lux and Disaris. They exist everywhere in the realms but are invisible to the eye, mingling to form the air that fills our lungs.\nMinerals are compounds that can be divided into their constituent elements.\n Wizard Minerals are unique in several ways. The most notable is that these minerals typically need to be removed from the earth using magical means.\n Apothecary Minerals typically require chemicals for both identifying the mineral and to make removal from the earth easier.\n Devotion Minerals contain a variety of gemstones, particularly rare ones. Unlike the majority of minerals, which can only form a single gemstone, devotion minerals produce many different gemstones of different colors, varieties, sizes, and rarities.\n Primal Minerals are the purest state of basic energies of the material plane in physical form. These minerals are some of the strongest for pure arcane, divine, and primordial magics.\n Blacksmithing Minerals produce a certain amount of utility for the crafting of weapons, armor, or other metallic wonders, and are the most ore-producing minerals across the realms.\n Noble Minerals are often associated with the other chain metal elements and have connections with coinage, riches, and many of the noble families. These minerals can be found in all levels of the earth in its tarnished form.\nRocks are generally composed of an assemblage of minerals and occur in three different forms or varieties.\n Primordial Rocks are formed from the elemental forces and deities primarily through wind, water, fire, and the earth; they comprise most of the surface of the realms.\n Mistral Rocks were once Primordial Rocks that were forever changed by the magic of the realms into totally new forms.\n Geoaegis Rocks were once Primordial or Mistral rocks that were broken apart by time and elemental forces, and then later reformed by the same forces into layers or clusters of different types of rocks.\nOre is defined as an economic concentration of minerals. The richness of ores can be vastly different, depending on the minerals and elements involved.\n Trace Ores contain tiny amounts of many different minerals; the percentages of these minerals can vary from piece to piece.\n Affix Ores have elements and minerals that are often used in a recipe or formula to make alloys, potions, and other complex items.\n True Ores are composed heavily of one type of mineral or element and are often the most sought-after for their overall purity.\nAs the individuals in our fantasy worlds go on about their routines, they use natural resources from the earth in their everyday lives. It is important to consider the form of that earthen resource and that the characters interact and craft with the resources everyday. Though most blacksmiths and jewelers would love to work exclusively with precious metals and gems, there is often much more involved when crafting with earthen materials. This chapter provides you with gemstones, crystals, and metals to fully immerse you and your characters in your fantasy worlds.  \nGemstones of the realms are found in many shapes and varieties. They form most commonly in the rocks and minerals that have undergone powerful elemental changes. A gemstone typically comes in one of three different forms.\n Precious Gemstones are highly sought-after, as there are only 6 varieties of gemstone known to exist that can claim the true title of \u2018precious\u2019.\n Semi-Precious Gemstones are basically every other gemstone that isn\u2019t classified as a true precious gemstone, with the exception of...\n Magical Gemstones, which are rare and form only near the primal and magical Ley Lines deep in the earth. One may have a magical gemstone and not even be aware.\nCrystals are beautiful, solid, often shiny earthen structures that are extremely geometric and semi-translucent in their natural shape.\n Bonding Crystals tend to bond with one if a certain spell or ritual is performed. This bonding takes a variety of forms depending on its origins, but the boons the crystals can bring are highly sought-after by Geomancers.\n Dwarven Crystals are valuable for the great boon they provide to metal crafting. Geomancers and blacksmiths use them to form Anethum and Thentine alloys.\n Mystic Crystals are formed due to their close proximity to the magical Ley Lines of the realms. The majority of these crystals possess a large amount of unspent arcane energy and are used as a spell focus and for spell crafting, enchanting, and soul magics.\n Force Crystals have close ties to the primordial magic from the time of creation. The majority of them have been trapped within the earth for untold years.\nMetals are found in ores, rich minerals, and rocks and must be extracted to form ingots which can later be crafted into items, weapons or tools. Metals can also be combined into alloys which make an overall stronger metal.\n Pure Metals can be found in nature but generally must be extracted or combined from minerals and ores.\n Anethum is an alloy that requires crystals to be combined with the metal.\n Thentine requires the combinations of crystals, metals, and magical gemstones to makes a most unique alloy for metalworking.\nWhen searching for valuable minerals, the traditional prospector relies primarily on the direct observation of minerals in outcrops, sediments, and soil. The modern prospector also employs a combination of geologic, geophysical, and geomancy tools to provide indirect indications for good locations to begin hollowing the earth.\nThe Ley Lines are magical, mystical alignments within the earth that connect other planes to the material realms. Many of the arcane mystics who study the art of Geomancy believe that these lines carry positive or negative energy.  This section of the book will cover what they are and how to add them to your world with ease.\nMany new Dwarven strongholds and landlocked cities of the realms are founded near substantial deposits of minerals or gems. This section contains rules for establishing and operating mines. It is presumed that most existing strongholds are built around profitable and extensive ones.\nEvery mine needs individuals to work them, manage them, and protect them. This section provides a massively detailed list of 100 NPCs to be used in the mines from this book or plugged into your existing worlds.\nWhile every race can trace its origin to the elements of the realms, there are certain races, monsters, and creatures that are more closely tied to the underground regions. Not all the children of the earth have legs and arms like the majority of the creatures. The children of the earth can also take the form of the beautiful creations of landforms, mountains, and more. This chapter will break down the environments, those monsters within them, where they exist, and so much more further detailed below.\nMany races in a fantasy setting have a form of communication that is common among them and their societies. This section of the book will break down the phonology, morphology, syntax, word construction, and alphabet of the original language of the Dwarves. It will also contain an easy to use phrasebook and dictionary containing 2,000 words ready-to-use by those who should know the language.\nThis section examines the lifestyle of the Dwarves, the organization of their clans, and the dwarven family, the smallest unit of dwarf social organization. The clans are the basis of dwarf society. A few dwarves follow professions that set them apart, but they are still influenced by mainstream Dwarf society, its values, and structures.\nMost Dwarves choose life underground, and while it is unusual for them to live in a surface settlement unless events force them upwards, it is not impossible. The origins of these cities spring from the unique world view of the many clans that spent thousands of years living underground.\nThis section includes a variety of dungeons from the different clans in the book and will explore the different elements of fire, ice, earth, and disease. \n Dungeon One: A Return to Mullodar \u2013 The Dwarven clans have come together in hopes of regaining the four long-lost relics of their ancient stronghold. Can the party clear this deadly dungeon of pestilence and disease and return the Dwarven relics to their rightful homes? \n Dungeon Two: The Pit of Gnawed Bones \u2013 The rise of new and powerful Trolls within the Copper Mountains has seen the local Dwarven and Halfing communities under attack. Thrown in the deep end of an immense set of caves, the party will fight their way back to the light.\n Dungeon Three: Qannesdam \u2013 The fires of Mount Blackpeak have gone cold, the Ashfoot clan's livelihood placed on the line. To restart the fiery core that beats within the mountain, the party will have to face the heat and flames of the isle of Qannesdam and return with an Elemental Heart of Fire.\n Dungeon Four: Mesmerizing Ice Vault \u2013 Deep within the heart of the Ridgeline Mountains lays the tomb of Kyvierrun, The Ice Scaled. Or so it has long been told. But with the beating crashes of the Frosthammer Dwarves' iron picks, this mighty Dragon has awoken. \n Dungeon Five: The Skyfall Tradition \u2013 The Skyfall clan lays open for the taking, the decade-long rule of Lunac Skyfall coming to an end. From the list of contenders, a new chieftain will arise. Can an influential party change the course of history for a clan on the verge of a new beginning?\nThis section includes 10 individual, unique locations that are highly adaptable to any campaign and can form a unique variety of terrains and environments. Game Masters can add these into their worlds with very little effort as we provide the environment, important locations, flora and fauna, inhabitants, dangers, a battle map, and more, all ready for adventuring.\nWe've prepared several sample pages that will give you an idea of the contents present in the book as well as the general layout. These were created from a first draft to give you an understanding of what the pages will look like; actual layout, fonts, and text will likely change by the final release to improve the overall quality of the manual.\n CLICK HERE FOR SAMPLE PAGES \nA lot of work has gone into creating and compiling the massive amount of information and gameplay we're packing into The Mineralogy Manual. Once we finish up this Kickstarter there will still be much to do, including editing, layout, proofing, finalization, printing and shipping. Here's our timeline for the project.\n Click here for the rewards spreadsheet version created by K Wirick \n  All content forThe Mineralogy Manual has been completely written and the majority of the illustrations are complete.\nFrom the get-go, we pledged that this book must be visually stunning. That means not only the artwork but the layout and presentation as well. This process usually takes 2 to 3 months, and our editor for the majority of our books has made his career in the realm of editing.\nThe general layout has already been defined as you can see in the sample pages; the trick is to make the final version of the book follow that guideline and still be visually dynamic to convey the look and feel of the book's theme.\nThe content of the manual is ready, so the funding will go entirely to paying our talented artists, securing additional artwork, editing, and stretch goal content. We've already gone through the book a few times to rehash and check the content and playability; the final edit will make everything shine and ensure the best quality possible. We have always found the value in paying for professional layout editing so that the book looks as good as possible, and to pay for a proper test print of the physical books to make sure everything looks exactly as we've envisioned. Funds will also go towards final playtesting after stretch goal additions, to ensure the best quality and balance of all the different systems.\nThe funding goal is average (when compared to similar Kickstarter projects). We're going about this slightly differently from our previous projects because, instead of unlocking tiny stretch goals and slowly building content, we're going to make the book as beautiful and content-heavy as possible from the get-go. The goal is to fill this book with as much world-building as we can and get it out to as many people as possible.\nAs many of our previous backers know, Deep Dungeon Games is no stranger to Kickstarter campaigns. After nearly 12 successful campaigns and thousands of happy customers, we are confident in our ability to tackle both the creation and production of new products and bring them to fulfillment.\nThe printing will commence after everyone has had a chance to view the digital version and confirm that the content turned out as expected. Additionally, this will put hundreds of eyes on the copy and layout to help us catch any fixes or errors before committing to printing. This ensures a better overall product.\nThe cost of shipping will be collected during the survey periods. We hope to keep costs down and will ship EU-friendly to all our friends and backers across the pond.\nWhen the Kickstarter reaches its funding goal, copyediting and layout will start immediately, and fulfilling all rewards will be the highest priority. Additionally, any work for stretch goals will be ongoing during the campaign. Depending on how the Kickstarter turns out we may extend the timeline of the overall project.\nThe PDFs will be the first item to be sent out as soon as the final layout and editing are complete, plus any other digital content. We have estimated the release of the book in October 2020, but are aware that delays may happen, especially depending on the Stretch Goals that can be unlocked.\n Mid May - Kickstarter launches. \n Mid June - Kickstarter completes. \n Early -July - Funds from the Project arrive and are distributed. \n Mid August - All initial content created for Kickstarter sent for editing and layout. \n Early -September - Any additional changes, edits, or new art (including unlocked Stretch Goals) will be complete by this time for final editing and layout. \nEarly October- Final PDF complete and sent to Backers, and sample prints of Hardcover Books ordered.\n Late October - Books arrive and all shipping completed by end of month. \nAgain, this is an estimated timeline and hiccups do happen. We will keep you updated on our progress and any changes through Kickstarter updates. We will also be editing the Kickstarter Page so you can always check the latest status there.\nAs detailed in the Project Section, all base content in The Mineralogy Manual has already been written, so these Stretch Goals are planned to bring more content into the book.\nAll backers that pledge $15 or more will benefit from every single stretch goal attained; there are no pledge-specific stretch goals. This is to make sure that everyone, regardless of the amount of their support, can enjoy the same full experience while using the book.  \nNew Chapter - locked \u274c \n A new chapter named Organizations of the Earth will be added to The Mineralogy Manual. This introduces three fascinating new guilds who pursue crafting and creation with the primary components included in this book. Your character can join one or more of these guilds and gain certain benefits, advantages, and loyalties due to this joining. Also in this chapter, we will be adding sections like religious organizations, geopolitical organizations, secret organizations, and more!\n The focus of Deep Dungeon Games is to create content focused on availability and world-building for tabletop games. It is extremely challenging to create content for every fantasy tabletop game, but we attempt to hit as many as we can. In addition, authors and other writers will find that a lot of our content can inspire a creative landscape, world, or even characters for their writings, and with everything we create, the hope is that you will be inspired to read, play, and enjoy fantasy.\nHobie Hill - A creator and content writer who has written 10 popular fantasy tabletop supplements and is the driving creative force behind Deep Dungeon Games.\nDaniel James - A specialist in dungeon writing, campaigns, and everything in between. Over five years of experience writing campaigns and producing content for tabletop games.\nElizabeth Fowler - A character design specialist with years of creative writing experience. She has many years of experience and adopts individuals from real life to create truly unique characters.\nMark Adams - An elementary teacher who lived abroad in Japan and is a language specialist with a unique ability to adapt the realistic aspects of languages into usable fantasy languages.\nAshten Delgado - A passionate player and creative content writer.\nTeresa Guido - A well-known artist in all Deep Dungeon Games projects who attacks every project with enthusiasm and joy.\nDeryl Arrazaq - A Concept Artist/Illustrator with years of experience in fantasy illustrations.\nRevis A. - A freelance designer for 4 years with clients ranging from local bands to famous pastry makers, with which he developed a vast variety of expertise in different fields of graphic design and illustration.\nOnedaygm - A professional graphic designer and a full-time freelance artist with 8+ years of experience.\nR. Lee Brown - Editor/Story Doctor for over 30 years who first played \u2018that game\u2019 back in the 1980s and has now polished and done graphic layout for several DDG projects.\nWe are forever grateful for your support and cannot wait to see the new tabletop games, accessories, and content we will create for us all to enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs many of our previous backers know, Deep Dungeon Games is no stranger to Kickstarter campaigns. After nearly 12 successful campaigns and thousands of happy customers, we are confident in our ability to tackle both the creation and production of new products.\n\nHowever, after the unforeseen circumstances in 2020 that have affected many of us, we have found that we have also been impacted. This has left us without the ability to attend and bring in revenue through conventions and events. While we have not experienced any delays in previous Kickstarter projects, we have had to reassess our situation. As such, this has given us a reason to push projects up on the timeline, however, this does not cause any delays in our current projects. We want to ensure everyone that everything is on schedule, other than the usual minor delays that happen in every project. \n\nThe support of this project not only grants you the ability to access the content, but you are also supporting a small veteran-owned gaming company that is trying to stay busy during these trying times. This will be our last project this year until we have sent out 100% of some of our other existing projects. \n\nIn spite of all this, we are very aware that game development, and the production of creatively intense projects, is an unpredictable process. Complications, changes, and similar struggles are an ever-present reality, and we won\u2019t pretend otherwise. Trouble may still arise as we continue the creation of this unique new supplement. If delays seem likely, we assure you that we will be open, honest, and swift in our communication of these delays to you. If immediate updates are not necessary, we will be sure to communicate any and all progress in our project updates made every other week.\n\nAny stated dates are goals presented as realistically as possible, at the time they are given. Should the project change during the course of its development, dates will change accordingly. We hold very strongly to the principle that quality comes first, and a delayed game is better than a rushed one that is on time. We want you to be satisfied with every product you receive from us and will do what is necessary to ensure the highest quality possible. Should delays or other changes ever prove necessary, we ask for your patience and understanding as you embark on another exciting adventure with us.\n\nFor production, we're using a proven manufacturer with amazing turnaround time and great product quality. Their facility will handle everything from the printing, cutting, quality assurance, and shipping directly to our front doorstep.\n\nOur artist has a proven track record of beautiful work and a quick turnaround time; this is the single longest part of our production process. We receive consistently amazing artwork on a daily basis with 1-2 finished art pieces delivered every day. We have already included the estimated 25 days of additional artwork in the project, so we expect no delays as we move forward.\n\nAs with our last books, final packaging will be completed directly at the manufacturer; however, final shipping to customers will be going through our hands. We have learned to plan carefully, price as exactly as possible, and remove as much of the time-consuming hands-on process as possible. That's why we'll just be printing labels and shipping pre-boxed decks!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Visitor", "descp": "If you don't have the funds to back this project right now but you still want to get your hands on The Minerology Manual later, simply pledge $1!

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber. You can learn more about Tiny Epic Pirates by engaging with us in the comments, watching the videos below, or by downloading the rulebook below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals\nIncludes 7 Plastic Ship Minis!\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Pirates, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe components shown below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Crimson Silver Mini Expansion\nThe Crimson Silver Mini Expansion introduces new Floating Fortresses and Silver as a new resource!\nPlayers are able to visit the Floating Fortresses as they move around the board and perform upgraded versions of Trade, Plunder, and Crew Up. Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nIn Tiny Epic Pirates: Curse of Amdiak, rumors of the unthinkable are spreading quickly around the islands. Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates. It will share the same width and height as well.

Our goal is to deliver the game in Q1 2021. Note this is an estimation and some things (like COVID-19) might be out of our control. However, we will do our best to deliver the game to you in time!\nGroup Pledges\nBecause each game box is so large and heavy, there is little to none savings to be had shipping multiple games to the same location.

Email us for a confirmation and for any questions: kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com. \nRetailer\nRetailers should be able to receive the same Kickstarter extras as other backers. That means retailers will also get an extra discount and have the option to get the Deluxe version (not available for retail after the campaign) and the Kickstarter exclusive story. For more information see here. If you're an interested retailer, pledge at the Trader level (\u20ac110). This is for the minimum of 2 cases, which is a total of 4 games of the retail version. After the campaign, you will be redirected to a special pledge manager where you can also upgrade your pledge to the Deluxe version and/or order more copies.

We're still astonished by all their enduring, wonderfull support and for making our lives so much easier!\nTerms and conditions\nThe following terms and conditions apply when you pledge to one of our games.\nREFUND POLICY The Kickstarter terms allow you to get a full refund if the request is received within 14 days from the end of the campaign. Any request made after this period will be at the discretion of Black Box Adventures and will be a maximum of 90% of the pledge cost (due to Kickstarter and card fees already paid by Black Box Adventures).\nRETURNING PRODUCTS If you fail to accept your package when it is delivered we will not issue a refund for the cost of the pledge (and shipping).\nDAMAGED PRODUCTS  We guarantee that the packages you receive from us will be complete and include all the items in perfect condition. If not, we will replace any missing or damaged items. Replacements for minor cosmetic damage to external boxes will be decided on a case by case basis.\nSURVEY RESPONSE  We will use a pledge manager. You will be required to fill a survey on that platform. We will send out several mails and updates notifying you of the deadline to fill the survey. If you do not fill out the survey by this deadline after notifications have been sent, we may not be able to fulfill your pledge.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT  Due to ongoing testing and developing and potential improvements suggested by the factory, the final product may be different from the prototype shown on this page. By pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final game may be different from that presented in this Kickstarter campaign. Having said this, Black Box Adventures will make every effort to keep the final game as close to the Kickstarter project as possible and only make changes to improve the game. If major changes have to be made, Black Box Adventures wil inform the backers about the changes and the reasons for such changes.\nOTHER LANGUAGE EDITIONS  The Spanish and French translation will be handled by 2 Tomatoes. The Dutch translation will be handled by Black Box Adventures. For specific questions or problems concerning the translation copies (also after the campaign) you can contact the responsible company. The other language editions will be available in all countries during the Kickstarter. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project and we're partnering up with a few other experienced companies. However, we rely on our suppliers just as you rely on us, and hope for a relationship of mutual understanding.\n\nWe've worked with different manufacturers in the past and don't work any more with those not living up to our expectations. That's why we choose a new manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \nSome events may be out of our reach. One such event is COVID-19. To take such events into account we've talked with the manufacturer and gave ourselves some more time to deliver the game. We would love to tell you your game will arrive earlier, instead of the other way around...\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. After production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We'll also be subsidizing a portion of the shipping cost for all pledges to keep your costs down. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfillment process. For more information see terms & conditions above.\n\nThe EU has recently implemented stricter tax regulations on online sales in general and crowdfunding in particular. We thus are obliged to collect and pay VAT on the value of the total of the pledge and shipping amount. VAT varies between 17% and 25% with most countries at 20% and above. The total amount is calculated on the amount paid for the game and the shipping. We have taken these costs into account so you will not need to worry about them. It is important to note that VAT is a sales tax that is separate from import taxes or duties. We will cover import duties in the USA, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand so you do not have to worry about those. Other regions might incur import duties.\n\nAdventures in Neverland has been developed over 5 years, with numerous play-testers and groups in different countries. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter (and COVID-19) to test the final content and to blind test the rulebook.\n \nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece, drooling with flavor by itself. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers. Together Adventures in Neverland will be a unique game, dedicated to J.M. Barrie's legacy!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll of our games are made with longevity in mind. We use high-quality components for all of our pieces. Short of losing pieces (which we typically replace for only shipping costs), our games should last you for decades to come.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll of our fulfillment and logistics are arranged to limit the number of miles/stops each game travels, by using multiple distribution hubs dispersed on different continents.

For this campaign only, we are including a printed rulebook in French for backers in French speaking areas. \n\nPledging for this Campaign\nShipping is charge during the campaign. To see shipping rates to your country, please click on the pledge level.\nProduction is planned for Q1 2021, with shipping projected for April.\nProducts marked as Exclusive will be reserved for direct sales from Queen Games only. After fulfilling the campaign, and as supplies last, remaining items may be sold at conventions, as part of future campaigns, or on our e-commerce portals. They will not receive a general retail release. \nWe are using Crowd Ox to help manage our campaigns. After the campaign, you will receive an email to  confirm your shipment details and add-on extra copies of products if you would like. More information will be provided after the campaign closes.  \nShogun Upgrade Kit\n3-D Buildings: 3D plastic shrines, temples, and fortresses (previously cardboard tokens).\nArmies: Miniature meeples (previously cubes). These have been included in previous Shogun Big Box Kickstarter campaigns, and have been tested to work in the cube tower. Please note we are not able to sell the upgrade kit without them.\nTokens and Revolt Markers: Plastic bits with heat-transferred image (previously wood or cardboard tokens). Please note these are the some tokens that have recently been seen in the very popular Board Game Geek \"GeekUp\" kits.\nMetal Coins: Custom designed metal coins. The design for the coins is still a work in progress, but they will most likely be printed in Europe, and we are striving to have the best quality metal coins we can. \nWallenstein Upgrade Kit\n3-D Buildings: 3D palaces, churches, and trading posts (previously cardboard tokens).\nArmies: Miniature meeples (previously cubes).\nCoats of Arms: Acrylic with printed image (previously wooden tokens)\nRevolt markers: Plastic bits with heat-transferred image (previously wooden tokens). Please note these are the some tokens that have recently been seen in the very popular Board Game Geek \"GeekUp\" kits.\nBonus Tiles: Acrylic tiles with printed image (previously cardboard tiles).  \n\nQueen Games Cube Tower Games: Hybrid Euro/Conflict Games\nDirk Henn designed Wallenstein in 2002 and it was an instant success with strategy gamers everywhere. The central feature was the Cube Tower which was used for combat resolution. Cubes in a battle are put into the tower, and what comes out eliminates in a 1-to-1 fashion until only one army is left. Some of your cubes might get stuck in the tower, but don't worry, they will come out later and provide you an unexpected advantage. The cube tower draws a middle line between deterministic and dice based combat, allowing for randomness in battles (for excitement), but more even odds across the course of the game. Plus, it is a lot of fun to dump a handful of cubes into the tower!\nThe Cube Tower games pairs this mechanism with area majority scoring for buildings which are built around the map and pre-programmed turns. There are 10 actions each year, and at the start of a year the order of these actions are shuffled and the first 5 revealed. You will need to choose which provinces that you control will perform  the various actions, such as launching attacks or taxing, from the start, much like a commander planning an upcoming campaign. The blend of Euro mechanics with an area-majority conflict game makes Shogun and Wallenstein unique hybrids between Euro games and conflict games. \n\nWallenstein was followed by Shogun which a new theme, new mechanics, and a new map that challenged players in different ways.\nFor More Info, click on the picture or the links below, or scroll to the bottom of the page. \n  Game Rules in Various Languages\nGames Rules in Various Languages \nWallenstein\nThe goal of the game is to earn points by controlling counties which have the three different buildings on them. At the end of the year, whomever own the most of each building type in the different regions of the map will receive the most points (with second and third place scoring as well). In addition to building infrastructure to score points, you must also feed your peasants or they will revolt. Revolting peasants can lose you armies and possibly the county. \nShogun\nIn Shogun, each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his empire and secure points. Castles, temples, and theaters replace the infrastructure of Wallenstein (as rice replaces wheat), creating a thematic experience for players who wish to move their exploits east to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nProduction and Delivery\n\n                     Production for both the upgraded components and Big Boxes is planned for Q1 of 2021. We plan on producing all items, including the metal coins, in Europe to help ensure high quality and a fast turnaround between product and fulfillment. There is typically only a short delay between the end of production and when we can start the fulfillment process. \nPledges to the US will most likely be sent via container to a fulfillment center. Please note that all shipping projections are our best estimates only, and not guarantees.\nWe offer \"friendly\" shipping to a number of zones around the world, including the United States, Canada, the UK, the European Union, and Australia/New Zealand.

In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\nQueen Games assumes responsibility for shipping your pledge to the address provided in the pledge manager and guaranteeing delivery either to that address via our original carrier, or its transfer to your local post service. If the package is successfully delivered to the correct address, or handed over to your local post service, our obligation will be considered complete, and we may not be able to provide a replacement if the package is not picked up or is lost by the local post. Failure to complete the survey by the fulfillment date could also result in a non-delivery of the product.\nPost Campaign Communication\n\n     We will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions. Please note that, since we do not have a full time employee dedicated to Kickstarter alone, we may not be able to actively monitor the comments after the campaign closes.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\nRETURNED PRODUCTS If you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY Surveys will be completed through Crowd Ox. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a few months.

We typically manufacture our components in the EU, which we feel offers us the highest quality and simplified logistics (not to mention the opportunity to support our local and adjacent economies). After the various types of components are produced they are transported to a single facility, compiled into the final product, and sent to our logistics partner in the Netherlands or our HQ in Germany for distribution. However, several of the parts for this product are types we have never made before, and we have determined that we will need to manufacture these specific parts in Asia.

Sharing news of the campaign Nets you guys even more free stuff and attracts new backers! \n Pictura - BoardGameGeek page \nHGG Facebook page\nPictura Facebook post\nPictura Tweet\n HGG Instagram page\n   You can read more about Vernissage here.\n You can read more about Crystal Palace here.\nAn easy to learn, hard to master set collection game with a wealth of strategic possibilities.\nGorgeously illustrated with over 200 unique designs.\n Featuring 180 historical works of art, each with accurate information about the painting and where it is currently exhibited. \nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 20-30 min per player.\nIn Museum: Pictura, players take on the role of aspiring museum curators! Their goal: to acquire the most Prestige points in order to make their establishment the greatest in the world.\nThis is done primarily by assembling Collections of some of history\u2019s greatest paintings. The larger these Collections grow, the more points they\u2019re worth when organising Temporary Exhibitions, as well as at the end of the game. But that\u2019s not all. Savvy curators will also need to navigate the upper echelons of society, attracting wealthy patrons, exploiting the ever-changing art market and calling in favours where necessary...\nPainting cards are the main component of the game. Each of the 180 cards represents a historical masterpiece, along with the following information:\nThese cards are shuffled together at the start of the game and split into multiple decks in order to form the Art Market.\nThe structure of a turn in Museum: Pictura is simple yet players will regularly find themselves confronted with important choices that will determine how their strategy (and Prestige) evolves over the course of a game.\n\nAcquisition phase\nThe player\u2019s turn starts with the Acquisition phase where new Painting cards are acquired from the Art Market by drawing two cards from any of the decks.\nThe player must then exchange a Painting card from their hand with one of the four International Museums on the central board. In Pictura, Painting cards have no fixed value. Just like in the real world of art, the value of a piece is subjective and can depend on changing fashions and opinions, which is where Trend cards come in. These are used in multiple instances throughout the game, but in this case each of the four museums is attributed their own Trend card randomly during setup. This card represents what kind of Paintings that establishment is looking for.\nTrend cards assign a value -in Prestige points- to a certain Period (header colour), Style (icon) and Artist (number). When exchanging paintings you place a Painting card from your hand into an International Museum of your choice before taking another one from them. If you give them a Painting card with criteria present on their Trend card, you\u2019ll gain Prestige. If you take a painting card with one of those criteria though, you\u2019ll lose Prestige points.\nOnce the active player has performed their mandatory exchange, each of the other players may also exchange a card if they so wish.\nIt\u2019s up to players to navigate this constantly changing pool of available Painting cards, exchanging paintings so as to strike a balance between gaining Prestige and acquiring paintings that best suit their strategy.\n\nAction Phase\nOnce they have acquired their new cards, players may perform one of these three actions:\nExhibit Paintings\nThe core of Museum: Pictura, and your main source of Prestige, are the Collections of paintings that you\u2019ll be building within the halls of your establishment.\nEach player has their own Museum board, onto which they\u2019ll be arranging their Painting cards. In order to exhibit a card, you simply discard any other card from your hand to pay for it. Discarded cards can be recovered by performing an Inventory action. However, cards in your Discard pile can be taken by other players, so pay attention to what you discard!\nExhibited cards can then be arranged to form collections of Periods or Styles. The bigger these collections get, the more Prestige points they\u2019re worth.\n\nExhibiting a card into your museum doesn\u2019t earn points. However, there is a Public Trend card that changes each round and represents the public\u2019s current preference. If you exhibit a card with one of the criteria shown on that Trend card, you will gain Prestige points!\n\nPerform an Inventory\nIf your Hand is getting a little sparse, you may decide to perform an Inventory during your turn instead of placing cards. This allows you to take cards back from your Discard pile into your Hand. This is great way to replenish your Hand and prevent your opponents from getting your discarded cards!\n\nIt also allows you to draw a Favour card and refresh the Patron cards currently on the board.\nEven though this action doesn\u2019t (directly) earn you any Prestige, it is great for managing your Discard pile and getting back into the game with fresh resources.\n\nOrganise a Temporary Exhibition\nThe final type of action a player can take is to organise a Temporary Exhibition. In Pictura, your museum is always open to the public but you can organise special events, galas and private viewings which take the form of Temporary Exhibitions. When you perform this action you get to score one of your current collections. This will earn you Prestige as well as the advantages of one of six bonus abilities shown on your player board which can come into effect during or at the end of the game.\nHowever, each player can only do a Temporary Exhibition for each Period or Style once during the game. Additionally, the first player to organise an event for a Period or Style scores bonus Prestige points to represent their visitors\u2019 enthusiasm for something new! The next person to organise an Exhibition on that theme still scores that collection but gains no bonus points. However, after the second one, the public will lose interest and no more Temporary Exhibitions of that type can be organised.\nThis lends a timing element to these events - they can represent a lot of Prestige points but waiting until your collections reach optimal sizes could leave you without a public that\u2019s interested in them!\n\nFree actions\nOn top of performing one of the three mandatory actions, a player can also perform the following free actions during their turn:\nCall in a Favour\nFavour cards are one shot ability cards with a variety of effects. You start the game with one and can play one during each of your turns. More Favour cards can be acquired by gaining more Prestige, as well as performing other actions.\n\n Acquire new Patrons \nDuring a game of Museum: Pictura, you\u2019ll be able to gain additional Prestige by attracting the attention of influential Patrons! The Patron board will show what they\u2019re looking for. If you have the Paintings requested by one of these Patron cards exhibited in your Museum, they\u2019ll reward you!\n\nOnce they\u2019ve performed their actions, the turn is passed to the next player and so on and so forth until someone reaches 50 or more prestige points.\nThe end of the game is set off when any player reaches 50 or more Prestige. They finish their turn and then each other player has one more turn before moving on to final scoring.\nTo the Prestige they\u2019ve earned during the game players will also be adding the values of the collection in their museums, bonuses from their personal Trend cards which are chosen at the start of the game as well as points from your temporary Exhibitions and rewards for filling out your galleries.\nPlayers will also lose points if they have too many cards in their Discard pile, so managing it correctly during the game is important.\nThe player with the most Prestige points at the end of the game, wins!\nYou can find the full rulebook here\nWe also have a rules and playthrough video:\nPictura is part of the Museum \u201crange\u201d. Despite having certain mechanics and contents that harken back to its predecessor in a recognisable way, it has always been designed to be its own game with the goal of providing a fresh new set collection experience and not simply being an \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cmore recent\u201d version of the original game.\nTherefore, despite its familiar appearance there are some significant differences from the original. You may have picked up on some of them whilst reading through this page but if you\u2019d like to know about all the new elements, then we\u2019ve prepared a video just for you!\n Don\u2019t have time to watch the video? Here are the main differences in a nutshell:\n-          The cards: Painting cards in Pictura work differently to the Object cards in the original Museum. They don\u2019t have individual values, so to place a card in your museum, you simply discard any other card, 1 for 1.\n-          Scoring Points: The way you score points during the game is completely different. In Pictura, you have a far greater variety of ways to score (and lose!) points during the game, from following Trend cards to organising Temporary Exhibitions and attracting Patrons. This gives you a lot more opportunities to consider during the game.\n-          The importance of timing: Although the original Museum had a certain element of timing to it, choosing the right time to perform certain actions in Museum: Pictura is incredibly important! Organising a Temporary Exhibition at the perfect moment can truly be a game changer. Keeping an eye on a fellow curator whose score is creeping perilously close to 50 is crucial too\u2026\n-          Optimising your Collections: Thanks to Temporary Exhibitions and your personal Trend card, it\u2019s possible to score a Collection more than once in Museum: Pictura. You\u2019ll need to plan your collections carefully to squeeze out every last Prestige point from the cards you place!\n-          Managing your Discard: In Museum: Pictura, managing your Discard is more important than ever before! Contrary to the first game, once a card has been discarded, performing an Inventory is the only way to get it back. On top of that, every card in your discard will lose you points at the end of the game, which can add up to a lot if you don\u2019t stay on top of it!\n English\nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish\n\nPictura has been in development since early 2019. After a studious research phase spent identifying all the paintings we wanted to have appear in the game we began testing the game extensively as the mammoth task of illustrating all the game\u2019s contents got underway.\nFast forward to 2020 and we have a game that is fully illustrated and tested. All other content shown during this campaign is also basically finished, some graphic and balancing tasks outstanding.\nApart from making some material upgrades, we\u2019ll be using the same manufacturer as the first Museum. With them having handled the original game, the pre-production and manufacturing Pictura should be a very smooth process.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nThe chart above shows the estimated cost of shipping the game to your region for each of the pledge levels. Please note that ordering multiple copies will increase these costs. For regions 1, 2 and 3 the shipping cost of each additional copy should be about 30-50% the first. \nFor RoW orders with multiple copies or particularly large orders in the other regions we will have to use particular courier services that willbe more expensive than usual. If this concerns you and you would like a more accurate quote of your shipping  you can message us and we will endeavor to provide you with one ASAP. \nNote that these costs are barring any unforeseen circumstances outside of our control. \nExact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase but we are confident that the numbers shown here are a very good estimation of the maximum final price.\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by March 2021. This may seem like a long time given the advanced state of the game, however, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.

From that portal leaps Pooky's evil doppelganger, ready to wreak havoc in our heroes' beloved tavern!\nUnlike his kinder, gentler (although still somewhat chaotic) namesake, this Pooky is evil right to the core. Our heroes will have their hands full with this harmful little bunny and his otherworldly doppelgangers.\nEvil Pooky is the 50th character in our long-running Red Dragon Inn series, so we've really pulled out all the stops for this one. The retail version of this game has a bunch of great stuff, and the editions you can get through this campaign just get better from there!\nThe Red Dragon Inn is a game for 2 or more players with each player taking on the role of a heroic adventurer (or sometimes a dastardly villain) in a wild free-for-all party at a fantasy tavern. Brawl, drink and gamble the night away to prove your mettle and be the last player standing at the end of an evening of bad decision making. Will you be able to outplay your opponents? Or will you wake up the next morning with a throbbing headache, a bit less gold in your pocket, and a horse awkwardly nudging you out of his stall?\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn. And if you're new to the game, we have two pledge levels just for you: the Newcomer Edition and the Newcomer Collector's Edition. These include the new Evil Pooky product, the original Pooky, and the original Red Dragon Inn game. With either of the Newcomer editions, you will have everything you need for a six player game!\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Here are the editions available through this campaign:\nThe basic edition contains (of course) the Evil Pooky character deck and side deck, plus his Boss Battle deck (he is a villain, after all - check out the Boss Battle rules on page 13 of this document). It also contains a complete 30-card Drink Deck with some old classics from the history of RDI, plus eight new ones. It also contains two promo Prize Cards for use in the Prize Variant we introduced a couple of years ago. (Stay tuned for the update about these!)\nAnd as a fun bonus, we've also decided to include something a little zany: Epic Pooky - a Boss Battle deck for the original Pooky! Yes, now you can play Pooky himself as the Boss in a Boss Battle! You could even play Epic Pooky vs Boss Evil Pooky in a Boss Showdown Royale!\nAs with most of our campaigns, all content in this game is unlocked on day 1. No need to hit a bunch of arbitrary stretch goals to get the game to have a good contents list - it already has that. However, to keep engagement high, we will be doing a bunch of updates with drink card reveals, so stay tuned!\nFor the Collector's Edition, we're going super heavy on the pimped-out swag.\nFirst, there are two additional brand-new promo Prize Cards for use in the Prize Variant. (Again, to be revealed later!)\nNext, some plastic bits. Have you ever wanted fancier, more tactile Fortitude and Alcohol Content Markers? Us too. This project will have them - molded plastic pieces sized to the numbers on your player mats! The Collector's Edition comes with 6 of each, and you can add more packs of 6 of each to your pledge by overpledging $12 per extra pack you'd like. \nBase diameter approx. half an inch\nIn addition, there will also be a plastic Pooky Mood Marker!\nApprox. 1 inch tall\nSo you get all of this:\nCrude rendering of awesome plastic bits!\nBut, you may be asking, what good is a plastic marker if you don't have the original Pooky deck? Well, the Collector's Edition will include a holographic foil reprint of the original Pooky deck. Pooky has always been a fan favorite, so we decided to swag out his deck. And while we're on the subject of holographic foil cards...\n... ALL cards in the Collector's Edition will come in BOTH holographic foil and non-foil versions. Yes, you read that correctly. ALL of them. The Evil Pooky character deck, the Evil Pooky Boss deck, the original Pooky deck, the Boss deck for original Pooky, the Drink deck, the promo cards, everything. So now you can blind your opponents not only with the brilliance of your plays, but also with the shininess of your cards!\n(Note that adding non-foil versions was a change that we made post-launch, so we are not allowed to change the items listed in the pledge level. Please see our update for more information.)\nThere are two pledge levels for folks new to The Red Dragon Inn: the Newcomer Edition and the Newcomer Collector's Edition. The Newcomer Edition is the Retail Edition, plus a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game, plus a copy of the original Pooky expansion. The Newcomer Collector's Edition is the Collector's Edition, plus a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game. (Remember, the Collector's Edition already includes the original Pooky!)\nThe Newcomer Editions give you everything you need for a game of up to six players, so either one is a perfect entry-level pledge if you'd like to dip your toe into the RDI waters!\nIf you'd like to go \"Red Dragon All In\", we have just the pledge level for you. The Ultimate Edition starts with the pimped-out Collector's Edition and adds all of the other RDI games as well. You get RDI 1-7, all of the RDI: Allies, the Smorgasbox, Battle for Greyport and its Pirates expansion, and even our Pathfinder supplement, The Red Dragon Inn Guide to Inns and Taverns.\nYes, you get all 50 RDI characters with the Ultimate Edition. But that's not all!\nFrom our merch store, you'll get a metal coin set, plus your choice of any character t-shirt.\nFinally, the ultimate piece of our Ultimate Edition is 20 copies, plus an art print, of a drink or prize card of your own design! You design a card, we art it, and you get copies to distribute to all of your RDI-playing friends!\n Backers from the US: Packages will be shipped from within the US. If you would like additional copies of the game added to your reward, simply over-pledge in $25 or $57 increments for each extra copy of Evil Pooky you want to add to your rewards. You can add any number of additional copies to your rewards and you need only pay shipping once.\n International Backers: Where possible, we will try to use regional shipping options. However, where that is not possible you may be responsible for your country's import duties or fees. Note that this includes Canada. We do not guarantee \"friendly\" shipping to any country other than the US for this project.\nFurthermore, we want to make it absolutely clear that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign. Backers will not have the opportunity to upgrade their pledge level after the end of the campaign and should pledge what they want during the funding period. Backers will receive a survey via Kickstarter to provide their shipping information a few weeks before we begin the fulfillment process. It is your responsibility to fill out this Kickstarter survey in a timely fashion if you want to receive your rewards by our predicted delivery date.\nFinally, if you would like to review the SlugFest Games Kickstarter Policy, you can find it on our website here.\nAs with most of our campaigns, we are not using a post-campaign pledge manager. However, if you want to pick up another RDI game to go with the cool stuff in this product, you can head to our web store,  where you can pick up any of our products without having to wait for your backer rewards to ship! During the campaign, we are offering free US shipping on all of our games, as well as our fancy metal coin sets. (Sorry, but our other specialty merch still requires shipping charges!)\nIf you'd like to try Evil Pooky or some of our upcoming semi-sorta-secret stuff, then you should join the SlugFest Games Digital Play Test Community today! All you need to participate is a microphone for chat, Discord and Tabletop Simulator. We host daily sessions and would love to see you come by and give our stuff a test drive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe pride ourselves in our ability to deliver a quality product on time, and we stand by our track record of doing so. We know how to run a Kickstarter project, and when there are problems, we fix them. However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is nearly done! The only delay that could come here is if we notice something really bad in playtest that we didn't see before.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have a great relationship with our manufacturers and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise, such as the situation happening right now with the spread of the Coronavirus.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Sometimes your stuff just goes missing and we have to print everything all over again. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Customs Delay: We have no control over the border policies of any country we import games into (including the US). Sometimes games get held up at a border - sometimes for a bafflingly long time.\n\n5. Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns much to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our suggested delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Retail Edition", "descp": "Get the basic version of the game.

This has allowed for a lucrative industry: Dino Ranching! \nIndependent ranchers have begun farming dinosaurs to sell to the highest bidders for use in their high thrill theme parks. \nYou are one of those ranchers. Do you have what it takes to out ranch your opponents and operate the most successful dinosaur farm!?\nTiny Epic Dinosaurs is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of dinosaur ranching, worker-placement and resource management. It features classic euro game mechanics with unique twists that portray the dangers of farming these prehistoric beasts.\nIn Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players control a team of ranchers and will be acquiring, breeding and selling dinosaurs. The game is played over 6 rounds. With each round consisting of several short phases.\nIn phase one, players will harvest the resources from their farm that are not being consumed by their dinosaurs.\nIn phase two, players will put their ranchers to work. This phase has ranchers wrangling and buying new dinosaurs to farm, improving their farm\u2019s security and supplies, vying for high dollar contracts, and researching technologies and unique dinosaur breeds. These unique dinosaur breeds introduce a large variety of special benefits players can utilize to separate themselves from their competition.\nIn phase three, ranchers return to finish their day\u2019s work at the farm.\nIn phase four, players arrange their ranch, making sure their ranch is suitable for the types and quantities of dinosaurs they have.\nPhase five is the feeding phase, and every dinosaur MUST be fed. Dinosaurs that don\u2019t eat will escape, posing a grave threat to your enclosures\u2019 security and your other dinosaurs.\nPhase six is for breeding. For each pair of matching dinosaurs you have properly enclosed, you\u2019ll welcome a new dinosaur to your farm!\nAt the end of the game, players will receive victory points for each dinosaur they have, public and private contracts they acquired and for their research developments. The player with the most victory points, wins the game.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Laboratory Mini Expansion\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion introduces certain rewards to players during play, like extra dinosaurs, resources, or research cards. To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats. \nDuring setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

The two expansions are designed and developed and require a last round of playtesting before being complete. We've got one of the most dedicated and talented teams around, and we are more than confident that everything will be complete ready for a timely transition to the next stage of the process as well as being great fun!\n\n*Artworking*\nAll art assets and all design assets required for the core game are complete, with the majority already ready for print. There's still a couple of bits left for the expansions, and a few sculpts left, all of which is scheduled for completion before the end of the campaign. Diana, Marco, Tim, and Tom are fast, effective and professional and are all dedicated to making this their best project yet on budget and on time.\n\n*Pledge Management*\nAfter the campaign is complete we will launch the backer survey, or 'Pledge Manager'. This will be using the service pledgemanager.com\nThe Sub Terra II PM page is already in progress, with completion in the next week or so, meaning it'll be ready almost immediately after completion of the campaign. We will leave the PM open until we begin freighting goods around the world from the factory in China. With any complex software platform, there's always the chance of something going wrong or someone making a mistake. We've used this platform for 4 years now, and have direct communication on a daily basis with the PM team to fix bugs on the fly.\n\n*Print Preparation*\nAll files for the core game without any stretch goals applied are complete and ready for print. expansion and upgrade pack packaging is laid out and ready for final assets. Artwork required is minimal and all print assets are laid out ready for final assets where needed to minimise turnaround time to print.\nThe ITB team will be visiting Longpack in Shanghai for a site inspection and print preparation session for one to two weeks to ensure the print goes to plan, on time.\n\n*Mass Manufacture*\nLongpack games are our manufacturing partner for Sub Terra II and the reprint of Sub Terra. Longpack is an incredibly well-respected printing company based in Shanghai who we've worked with on NewSpeak, Crypt X, and now Sub Terra. They are driven, professional, honest and effective. Importantly they are realistic and open about timelines, giving us the information we need to communicate with you on changes to plans. Mass manufacture of board games is really complex and can be delayed as a result of suppliers, other production projects, machinery breakdown or anything else that can affect a large company like Longpack.\nWe've made sure that all the stretch goals are pre-planned, costed, communicated with the factory and worked out production-wise to ensure there are no snags.\n\n*Freight & Fulfilment*\nInternational freight can have a deep impact on the timeline, as there are so many factors that determine how long it takes a shipment to get from the factory. We've selected the best logistics partners in the world, who are both knowledgeable about the tabletop industry as well as professional and experienced in international logistics. We have predeveloped plans for freight around the world, with estimates of the proportion of total print to each region to make planning for partners easier. Fulfillment has been planned out with packaging and labeling to be complete by the end of the campaign. Fulfillment planning has taken into account all pledge options, shipping regions, and possible stretch goals' impact on size and weight.\n\n*After-Campaign Care*\nWe now have a productivity platform that integrates all support emails, accounts emails, project mail, social media and more - meaning we can be far, far quicker and more comprehensive in responding to backer queries and issues. We will also be looking to hire a new customer service assistant as a full-time member of the ITB team should we reach a sufficient number of backers to warrant it, to allow for seamless service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a329 or more", "title": "Explorer", "descp": "The Sub Terra II Core Game, with all Kickstarter promos.\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["977 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "Seasoned Explorer", "descp": "The full Sub Terra II gameplay experience with core game, both expansions and Kickstarter promos.\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Expansion\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Expansion\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,083 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a399 or more", "title": "Expedition Leader", "descp": "The fully expanded and equipped Sub Terra II set, with core game, both expansions and all upgrade packs, as well as Kickstarter promos.\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II Upgrade Pack\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Expansion\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Upgrade Pack\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Upgrade Pack\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Expansion\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["955 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3119 or more", "title": "Grizzled Archaeologist", "descp": "The Sub Terra gameplay set\nAll original Sub Terra gameplay content\nAll Sub Terra II gameplay content\n*Sub Terra: Incubation, the new ST1 expansion also available as an add-on\"\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Expansion\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Expansion\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives\nSub Terra\nSub Terra: Extraction\nSub Terra: Annihilation\nSub Terra: Investigation\nSub Terra: Incubation", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["170 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3199 or more", "title": "Legendary Archaeologist", "descp": "The entire Sub Terra adventure, from cave to temple.

The other is a fearsome werewolf, who is both a formidable villain and a literal party animal.\nPresenting: The Red Dragon Inn Allies: Piper vs Ripsnarl!\nYou've seen these two tangle in Battle for Greyport, our cooperative deckbuilding game, but now they're coming to the tavern to join the party as our 48th and 49th characters for The Red Dragon Inn!\nThe Red Dragon Inn is a game for 2 or more with each player taking on the role of a heroic adventurer (or sometimes a dastardly villain) in a wild free-for-all party at a fantasy tavern. Brawl, drink and gamble the night away to prove your mettle and be the last player standing at the end of an evening of bad decision making. Will you be able to outplay each of your opponents? Or will you wake up the next morning with a throbbing headache, a bit less gold in your pocket, and a horse awkwardly nudging you out of his stall?\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn. And if you're new to the game, we have two pledge levels just for you: the Newcomer Edition, which includes a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game, and the Newcomer Collector's Edition, which includes all the fancy swag plus the original Red Dragon Inn game. If you get one of the Newcomer Editions, you will have everything you need for a game of up to six players!\nAnd so, without further, ado...\nHere's what you get in the Retail Edition:\nIn the Collector's Edition, you get several new bits of promo content, including two new Drink Cards, a new Prize Card and a second new Prize \"Card\" made out of metal! Expect more details about the promo content in a campaign update.\nAnd all of the content for this game is unlocked on day one of the campaign - no need to submit your pledge and then leaving the actual game's contents up to the mercy of the fickle Stretch Goal Deities.\nWe have some very important information for backers regarding shipping options for the various Pledge Levels. This info is divided into two broad categories of backers:\n Backers from the US: Packages will be shipped from within the US. If you would like additional copies of the game added to your reward, simply over-pledge in $25 or $45 increments for each extra copy of Piper vs. Ripsnarl  you want to add to your rewards. You can add any number of additional copies to your rewards and you need only pay shipping once.\n International Backers: Where possible, we will try to use regional shipping options. However, where that is not possible you may be responsible for your country's import duties or fees. Note that this includes Canada. We do not guarantee \"friendly\" shipping to any country other than the US for this project.\nFurthermore, we want to make it absolutely clear that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign. Backers will not have the opportunity to upgrade their pledge level after the end of the campaign and should pledge what they want during the funding period. Backers will receive a survey via Kickstarter to provide their  shipping information a few weeks before we begin the fulfillment  process. It is the backer's responsibility to fill out this Kickstarter survey in a timely fashion if they want to receive their rewards by our predicted delivery date.\nFinally, if you would like to review the SlugFest Games Kickstarter Policy, you can find it on our website here. \nAs with most of our campaigns, we are not using a post-campaign pledge manager, and we are not offering add-ons. However, if you want to pick up another RDI game to go with the cool stuff in this product, you can head to our web store, where you can pick up any of our products without having to wait for your allies to ship! During the campaign, we are offering free US shipping on all of our games, as well as our fancy metal coin sets. (Sorry, but our other merch still requires shipping charges!)\n\nWe've done substantial playtesting on all of the stuff in this product, but if you'd like to try one of the new characters or have a look at some of our upcoming semi-sorta-secret stuff, then you should join the SlugFest Games Digital Play Test Community today! All you need to participate is a microphone for chat over Discord and Tabletop Simulator. We host daily sessions and would love to see you come by and give our stuff a test drive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe pride ourselves in our ability to deliver a quality product on time, and we stand by our track record of doing so. However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is nearly done! The only delay that could come here is if we notice something bad that we didn't see before.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have a great relationship with our manufacturers and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Sometimes your stuff just goes missing and we have to print everything all over again. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Customs Delay: We have no control over the border policies of any country we import games into (including the US). Sometimes games get held up at a border - sometimes for a bafflingly long time.\n\n5. Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns much to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our suggested delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Retail Edition", "descp": "Get your copy of the latest expansion!

Each episode is a self contained short story set in the near future.\nEpisode 5 will focus on an environmental theme. With the living conditions of our planet in an increasingly poor state, the Silent Eye team have developed the next episode to reflect on a disturbing vision of the future, if we as a species continue acting as we are.\nAt the same time, we feel this is a strong episode narrative which confronts the issue, without ever becoming a \"message\" story. This episode doesn't preach to anyone, or pointing the finger of blame.\nThis story addresses the dilemma we face as a species. Aside from that, it's a very personal, emotional tale about a woman (RASHA), who is a wife and a mother of 2 small children.\nTo help save the planet, she faces the horrifying prospect of losing her future with her family. And this story is about her coming to terms with the sacrifice she is asked to make.\nBut there is still a chance she may escape the Sleep House... \nWhat is Silent Eye?\nSilent Eye is a science fiction TV show shot with smartphones. Each episode contains a new story with new characters. The series is currently available via Amazon in the USA, UK and Germany.  \nIn the last 4 weeks, Silent Eye has been watched on Amazon Prime for 1.7 million minutes.

Designed by the legendary Richard H. Berg, Mark Simonitch, and John B. Firer, Successors brings you the  best of this kind of game: tense and ruthless gameplay in a world of ever-changing alliances. \nThe development team at PHALANX has given this game a careful, meticulous update. It is now more accessible and easier to play. It contains gorgeous miniatures. It has received new, stunning art. It is even better than it used to be.\nJoin us to publish the Fourth Edition of this splendid game together!\n What do the players say? \nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nDuring the campaign we have unlocked 26 stretch goals. All of these items will be added to each SUCCESSORS game for free! \nOther pledge levels\n20th Anniversary Edition of Mark Simonitch\u2019s Hannibal & Hamilcar, winner of the Golden Geek award for the Best Wargame of 2018, sold out early this year. The game is going to be reprinted in 2020 in an updated version, containing a bigger box and rewritten rules. There will be also available an upgrade pack for the owners of the previous edition. These items are available for pre-order during this Kickstarter campaign. \nIf you already own Hannibal & Hamilcar, consider choosing the \u00a380 pledge to get the Upgrade Pack.\nIf you do not own Hannibal & Hamilcar, choose the \u00a3130 pledge to get the bundle of the best ancient war games ever published! \nPlease note that \u00a380 and \u00a3130 pledges are English edition only. But you will be able to choose French or Spanish edition of Hannibal & Hamilcar as an add-on to your SUCCESSORS Pledge in the pledge manager.  \nSUCCESSORS \nImmerse yourself in one of the best multiplayer strategy games ever published. Take part in the conflict between the titular diadochi \u2013 Successors \u2013 to the legacy and empire of Alexander the Great. Clash with your former brothers in arms turned enemies to gain control of provinces in order to increase the number of your Victory Points or pull appropriate strings to secure the Legitimacy Points (e.g., by providing Alexander\u2019s tomb with a suitable resting place). But beware, too many Victory Points with respect to other players and you will end up having the esteem of a Usurper who could be attacked freely by everyone. Therefore, choose your strategy wisely. It sometimes is more profitable to bide your time because every aspect of the game is intertwined and the sudden turn of events may surprise you with the most unfortunate outcome. For instance, you might be forced to take sides with someone who stabbed you in the back a couple of rounds earlier. However, as they must have said even in 4th Century B.C., the end justifies the means. Especially, when succession is at stake. \nThe fourth edition of this card-driven, point-to-point movement strategy is undergoing  a plethora of upgrades that will make it stand out among similarly themed games. It also pays homage to its past editions released by Avalon Hill and GMT Games, respectively. A new, improved layout of the board, charts, and cards, a rewritten and updated rulebook, an introduction to historical scenarios that streamline the gameplay and shorten game sessions, etc. The icing on the cake is its graphic design \u2013 a state-of-the-art map board based on an original art by Mark Simonitch, over 60 outstanding illustrations inspired by historical sources, and 12 large 40 mm plastic leader miniatures. All of these make the game a pleasure to watch and even more pleasurable to play. \nSo prepare your armies to buckle down, sharpen the blade of your tactical sixth sense, and whet your appetite for claiming your right to Alexander\u2019s throne, for Heaven cannot brook two Suns, nor Earth two masters. There can only be one true Successor! \nReviews\nGame Rules\nPlease click here to read the rulebook (beta version).\nWhy pledge now?\nTo save 20% off the MSRP!

This combination drives your hero's strengths, weaknesses, and defines your special abilities. We've build a bunch of unique choices for you, so no two games will ever play the same.\nYou'll work together to gather Platinum, Gold, Ravager Crystals, and Power Ups in order to advance your hero's strength while the Ravager wipes out crucial locations on the board.

Check out our Stretch Goals section below for more information on the added content.\n\nThe World\nNomadic legends speak of a great worm slumbering beneath the sands, stoking the fiery heat of the desert. Tales were told how the beast would awaken when the desert grew too cool, emerging from its slumber to bake the world above. For centuries the desert has grown and extended, proving, say the tribesmen, that the Ravager grows stronger.

These digital chapter books present new, augmented rules to play through an entire multi-session campaign using the same heroes! \nYou\u2019ll use specific map tiles and play through a ton of new content in these choose-your-own adventure scenarios. Players are presented with several \u201cWhat do you do\u201d choice branches throughout the course of play.

For more info on Campaign Mode, check out this update.\nKlik\u2019s Madness follows the rise and fall of Goblin Emperor Klik as hordes of goblins become better organized under his command, raiding and pillaging the Runecrest Valley. Your heroes will have the opportunity to save NPC\u2019s, earn new campaign items, get captured in Under Valley, witness Klik\u2019s transformation into an Undead Lieutenant working for the Dead King and much more! \nIn the Fall of the Ancients, the heroes will attempt to keep Hathowyr and Urgos' mind safe from the Magi's influence. They'll work for Elowen the Dryad, moving through the forest to stop Adrimon in her tracks. You may come face to face with Sarthowyr the dark dryad, and a cult of humans who feel Adrimon is a goddess. The story can unfold in a myriad of ways, and we can't wait for you to get your hands on it! \nIn Noko's Ritual, our heroes will find themselves unwittingly woven into the terrible plans of Emperor Noko, who works to summon the Ravager of Shurax. The heroes will begin the campaign working as guards for the City-State of Tarri and will unknowingly aid the tyrant in gathering the resources he needs to perform the ritual. Early in the story the heroes may uncover the terrible truth, and will gain the option to continue to help Noko, or to devise a plan of their own to stop him- possibly preventing the Ravager from even being summoned! \nAre you ready for this new way to play through HEXplore It content? \nExpansion\nExpansion Highlights:\n A new Play Style: the Ravager vs. All: Like our previous Volumes, the SoS Expansion allows you to play as the Villain against the other heroes.

You\u2019ll choose how to ruin the map, and will have an entire card deck to yourself. You\u2019ll also have access to powerful Rituals, which you can perform by expending your Ritual Points. You\u2019ll be forced to react to them, and better yet, force them to react to YOU! There are several ways to play as the Ravager, which means no two games facing off against the heroes will be the same.\n New Bosses: There are four new bosses that appear in the Sands of Shurax Expansion box. These bosses each have unique reveal triggers.\n Traits: Traits give your hero a distinguishing quality that you gain at the beginning of the game. Check out our video about Traits here. \n HEXclusive Heroes: We're offering more HEXclusive Roles and Races. These heroes are more powerful than our normal heroes. They are perfect for solo play, or can be used in small groups to up the ante and increase the Difficulty of your game. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!\n The Black Pyramid: HEXplore It's very first Maze! \nThe Black Pyramid: Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of the Sands of Shurax Expansion is the inclusion of the Black Pyramid. We've built the Black Pyramid to be its own play-style. You can go through the entire game, gathering power, facing new threats, terrifying versions of the Bosses, and perhaps most importantly, uncover epic new gear! The Black Pyramid is laden with traps and secrets chambers, so beware adventurers! \nFamiliar Mechanics: Here are just a few of the familiar mechanics you'll find in SoS that also appear in previous volumes.\nNew Mechanics: Sands of Shurax is no mere reskin of our previous volumes. Here are just a few of the new mechanics we've implemented which makes the Sands of Shurax entirely unique! Check out our videos page for more information on these.\nNew Game Locations: There are several new location types in the Sands of Shurax. Caravansaries are locations where the heroes can purchase low-value goods and join a Caravan. The heroes can heal Energy and refill their food stores while in an Oasis.\nUnlike Quests or Destinations (introduced in Volumes I and II), Missions are not tied to specific locations on the map. Instead, Mission locations are grouped into three terrain categories: Desert, Highland, and Silt Sea. Heroes may go to any Mission location that matches the terrain type to attempt to complete the Mission there.\nArenas & Scarabs: We\u2019ve built in 2 new mini-games into HEXplore It: the Sands of Shurax. The heroes can now earn fame and fortune in gladiatorial arenas and can gamble away their fortune playing Scarabs. For more info on each system works, check out our videos page.\nThe Wastes & Caravans: The Wastes is an area at the center of the board that is separated from the four quadrants and the other HEXtiles. This simulates a great distance between the City-States. To cross from one section to another, the heroes will need to travel with Caravans (or find the Magic Carpet!). Work with Caravan Masters to move into and out of the Wastes. Each journey will present unique challenges, risks, and rewards. Check out our videos on the Wastes for more info.\nRemnants & Mutations: Remnants are 3-hex map tiles that are placed on the board when the Ravager disappears back under the earth, leaving huge Crystal Towers in its wake. Crystal Towers are dangerous places where heroes become Irradiated and gain Mutations. Mutations reduce your maximum Energy ranks, but also grant special bonuses and increase the Power Up reward you receive for a particular stat.\nBoth the heroes and their opponents can gain Mutations, but Opponent Mutations function a little differently than Hero Mutations. Check out our Mutation video below for more info on these. \nThe City-States & Reputation: In the Sands of Shurax, your heroes will gain Reputation, which is a bit like their alignment. The four Reputation regions are: Righteous, Rebellious, Cruel, and Corrupt. \nThe City States are each aligned with two of the four Reputation regions.  You\u2019ll earn rewards for interacting with City-States whose Reputation matches your own, and  encounter dangerous scenarios when interacting in a City-State whose Reputation does not. Each City-State gives the heroes access to a new way to gain power.\nThe heroes can also find work in each of the City-States, spending time to earn both Gold and Reputation. Earn more Gold based on your Role type in certain locations. For instance, Strikers earn more Gold while Employed in Tarri, while Healers earn more Gold while Employed in Phorora.\nHeal the sick and help the poor in Phorora.\nBecome a street hand, helping merchants or picking pockets in Dria.\nBecome soulless guards of Emperor Noko, patrolling the streets of Tarri.\nPerform for the wealthy in Nemsynet\u2019s smoky gambling dens.\nWe've built in systems to prevent an entire game being spent in a City-State, however clever heroes can find ways to focus play there, instead of in the Wastes. Check out our video below for more info on the City-States.\nNew Opponent Subtypes: We're introducing a few new subtypes of opponents in the Sands of Shurax. Our heroes will now face Swarms and Hordes, opponents which have a new Vital called Outlast. Your normal attacks are largely ineffective against them. \nIn addition to Swarms and Hordes, we're also unveiling Titanic opponents. The Ravager is our first. These foes have more than one Health stat. Some opponents can even Mutate to gain the Titanic subtype. For more information on these new systems, click the video link below.\nRule book\nA beta version of the HEXplore It app is now available for download for both Android and Apple users. Check it out:\niOS users, click here to install.\nAndroid users, click here to install.\nWe are excited to announce that a new print cycle for both previous Volumes and their Expansions has been unlocked.

Here are some things our previous backers are saying about Volumes I and II:\nCheck out our hero randomizer on our website. Click away to create your next hero!\nDual Games - Play more than one Volume at a time.\nIf you have the Valley of the Dead King or the Forests of Adrimon, you can play along with Sands of Shurax in one session. You'll have two main bosses on the board (aside from the other 18!), both main bosses will be gaining power, and depending on how your game progresses, one or the other will take the upper hand.\nImagine if the Dead King came to control an undead version of the Ravager, or perhaps just as bad, Adrimon mindwiped the Ravager!  You'll need to defeat both in order to win this game. Your group will have access to all content that both games offer:  \nVisit several new game locations.\nComplete Quests, Destinations, or Missions.\nGain new items and build Relics.\nAcquire Gold, Platinum or Nature's Essence in order to gain powerful treasures. \nAttempt to destroy up to 18 more bosses! \nPower Up your heroes in an epic way using this play style. \nAll cards are marked for easy storage after play.\nSample Volume I and II Dual Game setup\nWhat are add ons? Add ons are items that we're selling apart from the pledge levels shown on the right sidebar. If you're interested in any of the below items, simply add up the cost of all add ons that you'd like to grab, and increase your pledge amount by the result. Add on's can also be added after the campaign ends in our Pledge Manager.\nAvailable Add Ons\nDice (choose from four types)\nDice Bags (choose from two types)\nLiving Card Decks (all 3 Volumes are available)\nHEXplore It Hero Chest\nVolume I: The Valley of the Dead King - 2nd Edition (Core + Expansion)\nVolume II: The Forests of Adrimon (Core + Expansion)\nVolume III: The Sands of Shurax\nDice & Dice Bags\n*These highlighted sets can improve your play experience for the Sands of Shurax.

Find the 36 Living Cards from our Living Card Campaign, as well as 24 new Peril cards which are played in an entirely unique way. Peril cards become an optional draw when the group rolls a hex on the Circumstance for the turn. When you roll a hex, you may choose to draw from the Circumstance deck normally or from the Peril deck. If you do, the revealed Peril card will have you play a specific set of two or more cards.\nThe HEXplore It Hero Chest: We\u2019re now releasing a premium storage box for the HEXplore It system. This box has three independent containers inside. It will hold all Roles, Races, Traits, and Legendary cards that we\u2019re planning to release in the HEXplore It gaming line, and it comes with a bunch of extra content! \nPoll: Take our poll to choose how you'd like to see the Hero Chest textured.\nPrevious Volumes & Expansions: We are excited to announce that we have unlocked a new print cycle for both of our previous volumes.

The above table shows our estimated shipping costs. The right column displays the amount of shipping cost that is added to your pledge at checkout.\nTariff Disclaimer: Due to the uncertainty of the current administration as it relates to tariffs, these shipping costs are subject to change. Our promise to you is that we\u2019ll only change our pricing structure if we\u2019re forced into that situation. Thankfully, tariffs were not enacted earlier in 2019; we\u2019re simply adding this disclaimer to be transparent with you. If you\u2019re unaware of how tariffs can affect the board game industry, check out this article: https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/5/18652411/trump-china-tariff-board-games. \nFlat Kickstarter Shipping Rates: One thing you'll find about our campaign, we're locking in our shipping prices based on the structure shown above. You won't pay any additional shipping costs for more content! Pay the shipping cost once, and load up on multiple products to lock in the best pricing. This pricing is only available for our Kickstarter backers only!\nTimeline\nOur first campaign delivered on time, and our second campaign delivered 3 months later than we had promised. This is largely due to the fact that we created 3 new boxes and remastered a fourth (volume 1 core). We are confident the time frame shown above (delivery to backers August of 2020) will be met or exceeded.\nOur Manufacturing Partner: We expect to team with Panda Manufacturing to produce the products found in Volume III. We're extremely happy with the quality of the components found in each of our previous volumes and are excited to work with them once again. \nOur Pledge Manager Partner:  Once again we're partnering with the helpful and somewhat ferocious gnomes at Pledge Manager to ensure your experience is a great one. You'll be able to alter your order and manage all add ons in our Pledge Manager shortly after the campaign ends.\nWe wanted to take a moment to say thank you, and to tell you a little about our company. We are a small team who greatly desires to bring you all fun and fulfilling content that can be used in a multitude of ways (even ways we haven\u2019t dreamed up of yet!).\nThe HEXplore It line was developed because there is a sort of fierce enjoyment that comes from telling a great story. The kind of story that evolves and changes because of the people telling it.\nWe are not a large company, and we rely on Kickstarter because we need your help and support to make these games a reality. Thank you for your consideration!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 3rd Kickstarter campaign in the HEXplore It series.

In After the Empire, you'll be recruiting refugees, gathering resources and fortifying your defenses in order to prepare for assault after assault of invaders seeking to sack your castle and take its riches. \n Cost:  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. There's a lot of plastic pieces and awesome game to pack up here, and that doesn't make it any cheaper. Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.    \nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \n Delivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.)  \n\nThe fine print stuff:\nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% more or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.  \nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to buying our company \"team building\" yacht.  \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

It combines the fun of crafting a unique blade with the polyhedral dice combat of D&D! Players start the game with a lowly wooden grip and Adventurer blade and compete on the tabletop battlefield to forge more powerful weapons with a plethora of grips, guards, and blades to power up their attack and defense, all while utilizing gadgets and shields to turn the tides of battle in their favor. The last player standing wins! For more detailed rules, scroll down a bit or watch our video! \nThe detailed rules and a printable PDF version of the rules can be found here!\nPhoto from demo event at Cool Comics & Games in Cape Coral, FL.\nAll 56 unique cards included in Reforge.\nHere's how they fit together during a game.\nHere's the layout with a four player game.\nWhere did the idea come from?\nThe idea for Reforge came to me (Stephen) in a dream early 2019 that involved a card game where you build swords. I immediately started writing down what I saw in my dream and built off of that. The game mechanics came after as I experimented with custom made cards. After working tirelessly for a couple months, I had a product that I was happy to show to the world! After doing some conventions and demos, I'm really looking forward to getting the game into peoples hands!\nI work full time in a hospital, but have always wanted to create. I haven't stopped since this idea came to me, and I don't intend to until it is realized!\nAbout the team!\nThe team for Reforge includes game designer Stephen Royka and artist Sam Donez (Twixxo). After being best friends since high school, we decided to make something awesome together! Reforge is the result of decades of love for gaming and cartoon art.\n I (Stephen) love videogames, with my favorites being Okami, Resident Evil 4, Hollow Knight, and Bloodborne to name a few. I work as an ultrasound tech to pay for my love of game design. I'm hoping to be able to transition into working full time on card game design for my new company Secret Boss Games someday! \nSam is an artist by hobby and trade. While he kicks ass at cartoon art, his real focus is 3D environmental design. Check out his stuff on his website, Art By Twixxo!\nWhy the $6,000 goal?\nThe initial goal is primarily to cover production costs for game and shipping costs from the factory. We are trying to keep this goal as low as possible because we really want this to get made. From the quotes we've gotten, it's looking like this will just be enough to cover all those costs. We have put tons of time, money, and effort into this project and want nothing more than to see it become a reality that people love!\nAnd what about that $8,000 stretch goal? (Reduced from $10,000!)\nIf we hit that response, then every copy of Reforge purchased on the Kickstarter will include four sets of polyhedral dice! You need dice to play the game, but we have a solution just in case we don't reach that stretch goal. A webapp will be available for free that acts as a companion for Reforge to keep track of health and roll attack die! The app is currently in development, but a preview of its functionality can be seen here. We really want to ship the game with dice for a complete experience (and we know most people would prefer the feel of real dice!) so we really hope we can reach this goal!\nWe recently received new quotes from manufacturing facilities, so we will be able to bring Reforge to everyone with dice if we reach our stretch goal of $8,000!\nCheck below for info on gameplay, rewards, and more!\n For more of the nitty gritty details for the rules, check out the complete rule list here!\nThank you to all the generous Tier 7 backers! Here are the Final Blades that they came up with that will be included in every copy of Reforge!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately, the project is already completed!

Shaking a hot chocolate will result in a quicker, smoother and more delicious hot chocolate with the added benefit of a little theatre. \nThe secret to a great hot chocolate is the formation of an emulsion between the chocolate and hot liquid. If you fail to create an emulsion, you will find your hot chocolate is weak, has poor texture and typically will have pieces of chocolate sitting at the bottom of the cup. \nAs artisan chocolatiers, we knew that to form an emulsion we had to create friction to bind the chocolate and hot liquid together. When we looked at stirring the chocolate and hot liquid together we found that not enough friction was being created to bind the two together. \nThe Challenge:\nWhen we started shaking a hot chocolate, we saw that it created an emulsion very quickly, however we also found that the shakers would explode resulting in chocolate all over our kitchen. \nThe Solution:\nWe discovered that when a hot liquid is shaken, the air trapped in the shaker warms due to the hot liquid and expands in volume. This means that a pressure is created when shaking a hot liquid. \nIf the shaker does not have anyway of accommodating that pressure, it will result in a hot chocolate explosion. Upon understanding this, we decided to try to develop an expanding shaker that would accommodate this pressure. We achieved this with our innovative popping lid. \nOther features of the Hot Chocolate Shaker include: Double Walled Beaker, Tritan Shatterproof BPA Free Plastic, Dishwasher Safe, Microwave Safe, Made in the UK, Recyclable.\nHot Chocolate Shaker Features\nHow to Use The Shaker:\n1. Reset the Shaker:\nResetting the shaker lid is the most important part of using the shaker. To reset the shaker, simply push the popping lid so it is in the 'Down' position. The clip below shows how this is done.\nPLAY\n\n2. Filling & Shaking:\nOnce you have the lid ready in the Reset position. Simply follow the below steps for deliciously smooth hot chocolate in seconds. The great thing about the shaker, is you can use solid pieces of chocolate, you don't need to use powders or flakes, you can simply chop up your favourite chocolate bar and shake!\nHow to use the Hot Chocolate Shaker\nThe Journey:\nThe Hot Chocolate Shaker journey started two years ago when we first came up with the idea. \nWe have had the tooling designed and made and run first offs, we are now looking to place our first order.\nYour Support:\nWe feel that we have created a truly innovative product that looks set to shake up the hot chocolate market, \nIn order to bring this product to market we need to hit a minimum quantity of shakers and that\u2019s where you come in. By supporting us, you will be pre-buying one of our rewards, which will allow us to place our first Hot Chocolate Shaker order. \nAs a thank you for supporting us, our rewards are all at greatly reduced prices \u2013 up to 60% in some cases. \nThe Timeline:\nWe hope to be sending the shakers in September 2019, if not sooner. \nIf we can fund this project and hit our target we can go to production very quickly. \nA Vehicle For Creativity:\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the Hot Chocolate Shaker is that since we have been using it, our creativity for hot chocolate has expanded enormously. \nWe believe our product is versatile and unique as it enables you to use\n- different types of hot liquids (milk, dairy alternatives or even just water).\n- to serve the product hot or cold.\n- different infusions and alcohols.\n- different chocolate types, origins and percentages.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have spent a large amount of time developing a product we are truly proud of.

Unleash a Flying, Flipping, Spinning Kick on your opponents, but be careful to hang onto a Block or two for when they try to do the same to you!\nAs SlugFest's first published game, Kung Fu Fighting has always held a special place in our hearts and the hearts of our longtime fans. This exciting card game hit a really good sweet spot as a quick and light game that still had some interesting choices and lots of silly, over-the-top cinematic Kung Fu moments.\nA typically over-the-top attack.\nSo after it was out of print we tried to Kickstart a totally new edition: fancy art, overhauled mechanics, higher production value, etc. Response was overwhelmingly meh.\nSince that failed project, we've thought a lot about this game, and we still get occasional requests for reprints. After the success of our low-key print-on-demand version of En Garde Reforged, we decided we should do the same thing for Kung Fu Fighting.\nWe are very much using the KISS principle for this project: Keep It Simple, SlugFest! Rather than redoing everything (art, mechanics, etc.), we are simply creating a lightly-updated set of cards with the original art and mechanics and sending that off to our friends at DriveThruCards for printing.\nHowever, as with the En Garde Reforged campaign, we have one stretch goal. If we pass $30k, we will do a manufacturing print run of the game instead. It will still be the lightly-updated original game, however. (For our previous Kung Fu Fighting campaign we underestimated the amount of love that was out there for the original version!)\nAs with our En Garde Reforged campaign, we can offer you the game right now, in a very functional, if minimalist way. Our colleagues at DriveThruCards do great, reliable work and are ready to publish this game through their print-on-demand services. In essence, your  pledge of support is a pre-order for the new print-on-demand version of the game, consisting of:\n Kung Fu Fighting deck\n More Kung Fu Fighting expansion, including extra cards for the base game, Archetype cards and cards for Team play\n6 mini-player mats\n2 large plastic deck boxes (the game is too big for just one!)\nThe rules will be available online and you will need to supply 6 objects to use as Chi Tokens  (which conveniently fit in the deck boxes!).\nIf demand for the game is high enough, then instead of offering a minimalist print-on-demand version of the game, we will manufacture a full production run of the game! Allow us to introduce you to our one and only over-funding milestone: the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal!\nAs you can see, we do not have an all-or-nothing initial funding level. We can create and deliver the print-on-demand version of the game with even just a single backer. What this Kickstarter campaign is all about, however, is whether or not we can get enough folks interested in the game to elevate it to the next level, taking it from print-on-demand to full  manufacturing. Therefore, there are no nickel and dime micro-upgrades with dozens of micro-goals like you might expect from traditional board game campaigns. We only need one, all-or-nothing stretch goal: If we can raise $30,000 everyone's rewards upgrade for free, becoming a manufactured version of Kung Fu Fighting with all the bells and whistles, including:\n Kung Fu Fighting deck\n More Kung Fu Fighting expansion, including extra cards for the base game, Archetype cards and cards for Team play\n6 full-size player mats\n6 Chi Markers\n1 Game Box with Cover Art\nRules\nThis upgrade includes all the usual micro-goals you usually see from  other campaigns: improved box, glossy rules, token upgrades, etc. Best  of all, even if we don\u2019t hit the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal, everyone will still be getting a great game (and, as a consolation prize, they'll be getting it way ahead of schedule)!\nThe unique nature of this campaign has some big ramifications on the estimated delivery date for the rewards. If we do not reach the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal, we will ship rewards as soon as the campaign funds become available. Therefore, we actually have two estimated  delivery dates:\nIf we receive <$30,000 of funding, rewards will be shipped out by August 2019.\nIf we receive >$30,000 of funding, rewards will be shipped out by February 2020.\nBecause we can only list one estimated delivery date on the pledge levels we can offer, we opted to use the farthest out date.\nBackers are required to fulfill all of their regional obligations for import. Unfortunately, there is no region-friendly shipping for this project.\nIn addition, we should note here that we will not be using a pledge manager for this project.\nInterested in picking up some of our other games?

We are offering two different versions of the rewards depending on whether or not we hit our stretch goal.

One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes,  who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side  takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to  achieve their objectives.\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a mission which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game,  number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to  achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing  sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game.  The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards... everything the  heroes need to play a mission. The villain box contains the miniatures,  tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the  fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals you have unlocked during the first campaign.\n This pledge level allows you to pick and choose what you want, and then decide on your pledge level \u20ac total.

This is a great starting point for you, and if you\u2019re curious about the journey so far you can view our previous campaign here.\nWherever you hail from, step aboard with us now as we launch the series into the farthest reaches of space\u2026\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  is a simple, sci-fi adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling, and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes about 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nOver the course of three acts the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, from cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete the challenges before them.\nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the mission deck, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive. If any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122 is inspired by classic sci-fi books, films, and TV programmes, including Alien, the original Star Wars trilogy, and Star Trek: The Next Generation to name a few \u2013 and of course, this being part of the Escape the Dark\u2122 series, it also has its roots in the classic adventure experiences of the Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. \nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within about 5 minutes. Below is a step-by-step overview, or scroll down for a gameplay video. If you\u2019re interested in learning more you can read a very early draft of the rule book here. \nKeen to know what it's like to play Escape the Dark Sector? \nSit back and enjoy this demo game with the team at On Tabletop: \nAt its core, Escape the Dark Sector\u2122 utilities the same narrative game engine as Castle, but adds several new features that make it a different experience altogether: \n A 3-Act Adventure: The chapter cards which make up the mission deck are divided into three acts, each getting progressively more challenging as the mission goes on and each also offering different item drop-rates and a different ratio of encounter types - allowing for a new layer of decision making and strategy. \n Thrilling Ranged Combat: From lowly Slug-pistols to formidable Beam-emitters, a ranged combat system has been designed from the ground up to add thrilling firefights to the adventure. But even with an array of weaponry at your disposal, teamwork remains vital to mission success. \n Tactical Combat Actions: As the game\u2019s intense firefights play out, the highly-trained crew have a wide selection of tactical options at their disposal - including Shoot, Charge, Take Cover, Flank, Ambush, Treat Wounds, and Reload. Forming a robust plan of attack is essential to taking down tough enemies. \n Cybernetic Implants: Each member of the crew is fitted with a interchangeable neural-augmentation chip, giving them a unique enhancement to call upon during the adventure - from pain inhibitors to advanced-reflexes. Players will have the option to switch these out, either to swap with another member of the crew or to replace them with upgrades found along the way  - but doing so incurs an HP penalty! \nYou can find more information about these and other features of the game, in our early draft rulebook here. \nHere's an interview with co-designer Thomas Pike, talking in more detail about some of the game's features: \nSince the game is still in development, the exact contents may vary from that shown here.\n What makes the ESCAPE THE DARK\u2122 series different?\n\u2022 It\u2019s approachable - The game is designed with non-gamers in mind, but is no less rich and rewarding for it. Now anyone can enjoy the atmosphere of a classic sci-fi mission. \n\u2022 It\u2019s quick - It takes less than 5 mins to set up and around 45 mins to play. No downtime, no elimination, and full player engagement throughout. No-one will be bored.\n\u2022 It\u2019s social - Many chapters offer a the group a choice, stimulating regular player interaction and discussion. It's perfect for the pub or a games cafe, but can even be played solo!\n\u2022 It's different every time - You never know what the next chapter will be, so there is plenty of tension and suspense as your unique adventure unfolds each game.\n\u2022 It has a unique look - Many games look alike these days. Here is something truly distinct for your collection. We've worked hard to create a stylish look evocative of retro classics.\n\u2022 There are no heroes - The playable characters are refreshingly ordinary. No musclebound heroes or buxom heroines here, and there is an equal mix of male and female characters.  \n\u2022 You'll be part of something big \u2013 With a wide range of Escape the Dark products already released, a wealth of adventure awaits you. Join our ever-growing community of players! \nWe have organised our pledge levels and add-ons to allow every possible combination of rewards.\nAt each pledge level, on top of the pledge itself, a shipping charge will apply based on your location. We've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum. See the Shipping section for details.\n LEVEL 1: \u00a330.00\n(RRP \u00a334.99) \nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section.\n LEVEL 2: \u00a335.00\n(RRP \u00a341.97) \nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nOne pack of A6 Clear Matte Sleeves\nOne pack of A8 Clear Matte Sleeves\nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section. \n LEVEL 3: \u00a355.00\n(RRP \u00a361.94)\nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nFour Crew Terminal Playmats\nOne Mission Playmat \nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section. \n LEVEL 4: \u00a360.00\n(RRP \u00a368.92)\nOur top level pledge, the complete package with a large discount for the ultimate Escape the Dark Sector experience! \nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nOne pack of A6 Clear Matte Sleeves\nOne pack of A8 Clear Matte Sleeves\nFour Crew Terminal Playmats\nOne Mission Playmat \nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section. \nOur \u00a316k funding goal will cover the manufacturing and associated logistical costs of this campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer our backers the following freebies and upgrades: \nPlease note: All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP.\nUNLOCKED! \nAt this level of funding, we'll commission an Original Soundtrack to perfectly accompany gameplay -  composed and performed by Alex Crispin.\n All backers will get the MP3 files delivered to them free of charge via Backerkit when the campaign delivers, and physical copies of the soundtrack on vinyl will be unlocked as an optional add-on.\nUNLOCKED!   \nAt this level of funding, we'll commission two books by Thomas Paul Pike: \nMission Log - a collection of interconnected short fiction, delving into the background stories of the crew and their ill-fated mission, and of course offering what little is known about the game's vile adversaries.\nDeath in Deep Space - adds contextual death scenes to gameplay.  No matter which chapter, item or boss brings about your untimely death, simply flip to the corresponding page for full immersion into the final events of the mission.  \nAll backers will get a free PDF of each of these books delivered to them via Backerkit, and physical copies of the books will be unlocked as an optional add-on. \n UNLOCKED!    \nAt this level of funding, we'll produce a range of T-shirts for Escape the Dark Sector, available to all backers as a optional add-on. \n At this level of funding, we'll produce a companion app for Escape the Dark Sector. Free to download when it launches, and compatible with both iOS and Android devices. \nSimple, elegant and atmospheric, it will be designed to be used on the tabletop alongside the physical game to do things like: \nTrack Crew HP, play the soundtrack, display pages from Death in Deep Space, and offer searchable rules and FAQ. \nThis will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. \nWhile the best way to experience Escape the Dark Sector will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny making a digital version does sound fun. If we raise a million pounds, we'll take the plunge into computer games. \nThis will be free to all backers, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nHow does it work? \nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply increase your pledge amount by the total value of all the add-ons you want. \nAt the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to select exactly which items you want to put your pledged amount towards. \nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the base level shown on the charts in our Shipping section. We'll calculate your new shipping total in Backerkit at the end of the campaign (based on your location and the total weight of your order). \n In case you want more than one, we're offering additional copies of the main game. \nLuxurious card sleeves specially designed to protect your Escape the Dark Sector collection. \n There are sleeves for both sizes of cards: A6 (large) and A8 (small). One pack of each is enough to completely sleeve the game.\nTake your game to the next level of desirability with our beautifully illustrated neoprene playmats - transforming your play area into a computer terminal. Each mat serves one member of the crew. \nThere is a lot going on in the mission area during a game of Escape the Dark Sector. Add a bit of 'mission control' to your experience with this evocative playmat.  \nA soundtrack specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay, housed in a luxurious sleeve. A must for collectors. \nPrepare to immerse yourself even further into the Dark Sector with Mission Log - a collection of short fiction penned by published game-writer and co-designer of Escape the Dark Castle, Thomas Pike. Delve into the background stories of the crew and their ill-fated mission, and learn what little is known about the game's vile adversaries.\nAdd a new narrative dimension to your games with Death in Deep Space, containing a contextual 'death scene' for every chapter card in the game capable of killing you, and of course for the bosses too.\nNo matter which chapter card finishes you off, you'll be able to flip to the corresponding page and read out all the gory details of your demise. What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Sector?\nIf you choose to pledge for the Join the Crew add-on, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw an exclusive crew portrait - of you! \nHow it works: \nPick the crew member you'd like to become, then take a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines (we'll send these out after the campaign).We do the rest. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. The cards will be produced to full game specification, and will be fully playable when paired with the die of your chosen character. \nImagine the satisfaction when you Escape the Dark Sector personally!\nEscape the Dark Castle Bundles\nIf you missed out on our first game, this is the perfect chance to catch up, and save money while you're at it.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMojito Studios is a newborn publishing house, but it comes from a 10 year long experience in the boardgame world and as a natural consequence of a planned growth over the course of time. This is our first Kickstarter campaign: everything must begin somewhere, so what could have been better to begin our experience on KS than a project as big as \u201cCleopatra and the Society of Architects: Deluxe Edition\u201d? We want to assure you that we worked hard for this KS to be a success: we contacted professionals to guarantee the highest possible quality throughout the planning, production and shipment phases. Of course, unexpected events can happen in every project, but we can ensure you that we have made all the possible, foreseeable arrangements to minimize their possible impact. The estimated date of arrival of \u201cCleopatra and the Society of Architects: Deluxe Edition\u201d is March 2020, but keep in mind that this is just approximate and that we will do everything in our power to release it earlier. As soon as the game is ready, we will ship it to all the backers: keep in mind, though, that, due to international shipping logistics, backers from some regions might receive their rewards before. We will do everything we can to make sure you will get the best possible experience and to deserve your trust. We need your help to make this project come true and we hope you will support us: stay with us, then, and we will see our dream come to life!\n\nThank you, \n\nMojito Studios Team\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Pledge Manager Access", "descp": "Follow along with the campaign.
