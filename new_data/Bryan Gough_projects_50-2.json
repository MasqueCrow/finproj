Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions! Check the FAQ for details.\nPledge levels and the shipping fees above do not include VAT. If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

Playtesting has been underway for several months. Much of the art for the book has already been completed. \n\nAbsolute Tabletop has developed dozens of RPG products, and managed four successful Kickstarter projects. They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

Whoever has the Agent itself scores even more points, but only if they successfully lead others off their trail!\nAs the end of round approaches, the stakes get higher and higher\u2014every action taken affects who ends up with the Agent card, as well as who might know its location! Deceive your friends with mind games, reverse psychology, and other strategic plays to maximize your points.\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg\u2014keep an eye out for stray point cards, the valuable Asset card, the elusive Double Agent, and much more\u2026\nIf you enjoy strategy card games or spy-themed stuff as much as we do, join the #Agency and help us make this game a reality! Your mission is a go.\nWith all the love in the known universe,\nJohn \ud83d\udc27 , Ethan \ud83d\uddff, Alex \ud83c\udf2e\n\nWhen the campaign ends, we will be ordering the decks in bulk from PrintNinja, a top-reviewed custom printing manufacturer we've partnered with.

Our current estimate for when you'll get the game in your hands is October 2021!\nThe above is a prototype from The Game Crafter. The final decks will be ordered from PrintNinja using higher quality materials with all the same card counts!\n The Origin Story \nOn day 5 of a 16-day cross-country road trip, deep into the barren yet beautiful highways of Idaho, arguably hallucinating in the heat of the van, John turned to Alex and asked, \u201cYo, wanna make a card game?\u201d\n\u201cIght.\u201d\nThe original idea was to have a ~special card~ and aim to end the round with it in your hand. The card was nicknamed \u201cthe card\u201d, and so the game \u201cthe card the game\u201d.\nSoon enough, basic action cards like Search, Investigate, and Wiretap were added (various name changes omitted), among others.\nFinally, the yin to the yang of \u201cthe card\u201d was added: the endgame voting chart. \u201cIt would be super interesting if you only want to end with \u2018the card\u2019 if some players don\u2019t know you have it\u2014it\u2019d be a constant mind game battle whether to keep it or give it away, and how many players know where it is or not!\u201d\nEventually we added a spy theme to spice things up. \u201cThe card\u201d became the Agent, and the game became \u201cIntel\u201d. Of course\u2026 it\u2019ll always be \u201cthe card the game\u201d in our hearts. \ud83e\udde1 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: a tuck box poker deck is a relatively straightforward product to make.

Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts!\nBattle massive monsters in a wild open world.\nWith two complete core sets, playable standalone or together, you can embark on quests in two distinct habitats teeming with native beasts. \nAs you gain more experience, the monsters get tougher. Every beast has three difficulty levels to challenge your skills. Successfully slay a 4-star monster, and you\u2019ll win your campaign!\nWant a one-shot monster fight without the tracking? \nArena quests let you hunt any monster, at any difficulty level, using any hunters, right away. Simply equip your hunters with the recommended loadout and dive headfirst into the fight!\nExplore the lush Ancient Forest...\n\n...the arid Wildspire Waste...\n...or combine sets to expand your world!\nPlay with any combination of hunters and hunt any combination of monsters during your campaign. Because hunters can make equipment from other sets, combining sets opens up a whole new world of weapons and armour for your hunters to craft.\nFind out how the core sets combine\n\n\nBecause hunters are defined by their weapons, every hunter is a different way to play. Where the great sword hunter trades movement for raw strength, commanding respect with its incredible stopping power, the dual blades hunter favours swift strikes and mobility \u2014 dashing in with a flurry of blows before dodging to safety.\nSome video game weapons come with extra special features, like the charge blade and insect glaive. To really squeeze the juice from that Divineapple in the board game, those hunters come with special rules.\nThe monsters you hunt will determine which loot you earn and what weapons you can craft to help on your next quest. So, you\u2019ll need to decide together where to follow the Scoutflies next. \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a monster, track them through the lush Ancient Forest or arid Wildspire Waste using the choose-your-own-adventure quest book.\nImmerse yourself in the New World, gathering resources, avoiding health-sapping pitfalls, and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment.\nJust like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. The tracks you discover will determine what state you find the monster in, and which special attack is added to their deck.\nEnjoy the beauty of the landscape as you climb trees, scale cliffs, and explore caves for bonus resources \u2014 but don\u2019t get too distracted. Every quest has a time limit. As you hunt, you\u2019ll discard time cards, giving you less time to take down the beast when you eventually track it down...\nDiscover more about the Gathering Phase\nIt\u2019s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these! Every monster is a boss, and every boss is a unique challenge, with different ways of moving, different attack styles, and special rules that will trigger during battle to change things up.\nMonsters dictate the flow of battle, deciding who to target and even taking the first turn.\nLuckily, the more experience you gain, the better you\u2019ll get at predicting the monster\u2019s next move. As you learn their \u2018tells\u2019, the clues on the back of every behaviour card will give you a bigger hint at what\u2019s coming next.\nOnce the monster has made their move, it\u2019s your chance to react! Because these are wild beasts you\u2019re fighting, you won\u2019t always have the same opportunity to act before the monster moves again. \nYou\u2019ll need to decide who\u2019s best placed to attack, who needs to sharpen their weapon, and who needs to get the heck out of the way before the beast strikes again...\nDiscover more on Monster Behaviour\nYour position matters. Monsters have four arcs for their behaviours and their body parts: front, left, right, and rear. Where you\u2019re standing determines whether you\u2019ll get hit, but also what parts you can target.\nBreaking parts can trigger rules that change monster behaviour and earn bonus loot for your whole party, which you can use to craft upgraded weapons for taking on tougher beasts.\nWhen you\u2019re taking on a monster, three things are vital to success: positioning, teamwork, and managing your cards.\nThere are no dice in combat. Instead, combat is controlled by cards which you\u2019ll use to create combos, meaning you\u2019ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina.\nBecause attack cards can also be used for movement and dodging attacks, which also uses stamina slots, you\u2019ll need to make strategic choices about when to play cards and when to keep your board clear.\nKeep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!\nDiscover more on How Hunters Work\n Craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles, swapping cards into your deck to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks.\nChecking potential rewards is key to choosing your next monster quest. Some equipment offers elemental damage and resistance which could help you in a future hunt.\nBecause everything you craft stays in your inventory, switch equipment between quests to give you the best chance against the next beast!\nYou\u2019ll start with a unique attack deck based on your hunter\u2019s weapon and upgrade options you can craft from bone and ore. The more monster loot you claim, the better your weapon choices become!\nDiscover more on Upgrading Your Hunter\nLike the video game, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game is a campaign game. Over multiple sessions, you\u2019ll face tougher monsters, upgrading your hunter and equipment as you go.\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt \u2014 until you\u2019re ready to take on a 4-star monster and win your campaign!\nWith 25 campaign days to spend (more if you're playing with combined sets), you'll need to make strategic choices about which monster to hunt and when. \nWill you hunt tougher versions of the same monster to craft all the weapons you can? Or try a fresh challenge?\nAfter a heart-pounding hunt, you may want to kick back and relax. Spend a few campaign days at HQ visiting the Smithy to craft new equipment, petting the Poogie, and enjoying a meal whipped up by the Meowscular Chef!\nHow Hunters Work\nTracking Monsters\nMonster Behaviour\nUpgrading Your Hunter\nArena Quests \n Combining the Core Sets\n   We\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs.

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

Players deploy recruits into battle, then spend their available action points during each activation. Trigger powerful attacks and abilities from either a deployed recruit itself or from the cards in their hand.\nTo begin play, each player chooses a runelord then everyone chooses one of several game modes. Follow the setup and win conditions found in the Battle Compendium and hit the battlefield!\n\nQUICK OVERVIEW  \nLet's have a look at some gameplay basics:\nACTIONS\nThere are several types of actions that recruits can take during play. All actions will have a cost associated with them and every recruit has access to three action points to spend per activation. If you see an action point icon, simply pay the corresponding point and perform the action shown. \n32mm runelord miniatures available as an add-on! Models do not come painted.\n\nBATTLE DICE\nThere are 5 battle dice in the game, each tiered by color. The higher the tier, the more powerful the dice.\nThe combat system is progressive. The better you roll on the battle dice, the more wounds are dealt and the more varied the attack's effects will be. In the example below, watch how this melee attack gets better as the rolled dice tier increases!  \nTAKING ENDOWMENTS\n  During each warzone activation, players have three options when using Facilitators:\nOption 1: If activating a warzone with a runelord deployed, simply discard any number of Facilitators from your hand during the Endow Phase and increase any rune of your choice by one for each Facilitator discarded in this way.\nOption 2: When activating a warzone with a non-runelord recruit deployed, you may discard a single Facilitator during the Endow Phase and destroy the deployed recruit to increase any rune of your choice by one. If you have another recruit in your hand to deploy, do so, and keep fighting!\nOption 3: During the Active Phase of any recruit you control, you may discard any number of Facilitators from your hand and draw a card for each Facilitator discarded in this way.\nRECAP: Unique Aspects\n Recruit Actions: When you draw into a recruit, if you do not need or want that recruit to be deployed into battle, you can spend them from your hand for their actions just like any other card! Does that Peacekeeper need a ranged attack this turn? Play your Hound Master for her attack action and discard it. This not only creates surprise attacks that your opponents don't see coming, but it is also a great way to free up hand space if you need to draw cards and you are at your max hand size. \n Endowments: Runes allow players to level up mid-combat! Do you need that one extra hex of movement? Good thing you drew that Facilitator. Unlock an endowment of Grace and get there!\n Modular Map Tiles: Do you want to play a small, single-tile battlefield where there's nowhere to run? Select one of six double-sided tiles small enough to bring the battle to a coffee table. Want to play a full-on war with four players? Put all six map tiles together for a 19x27\" double-sided battlefield! [Spoiler: If we are fortunate enough to unlock our second set of double-sided map tiles, they are designed to combine with the core tiles offering two more 38x54\" battlefields! Not recommended for coffee tables.] \n Battle Dice: The progressive battle dice system puts all of the important information during combat into one place. Simply roll the attack's denoted dice and apply the wounds rolled to the target along with any Weak (circle), Strong (triangle), or Critical (star) effects rolled, each effect unique to the attacking recruit! \nThis guide is a work in progress.\nJoin the game designers for this quick overview of combat basics: \n [NOTE: All components shown are prototypes and can change based on your feedback.] \nThink you're ready to give it a shot? Download our demo on Tabletop Simulator!\nAdventures are scenario-based experiences for 1-4 players depending on the selected adventure. Each adventure will have a guide on how to set up the components for play and specific win|lose conditions for players to solve, hindered by the actions taken by AI-driven recruits called villains.\nVILLAINS\nVillains follow a simple series of behaviors that are unique to each villain in the adventure. When activating a villain, simply follow its list of behaviors in the order shown. When they have completed all of their behaviors, their activation is complete.\nLet's have a look at a villain from the adventure, The Unrighteous King:\nAt the top, you will note that this Brute has rulesets for both one or two-player experiences. Every villain will have rulesets that scale its difficulty based on the number of players. In this example, all of this villain's innate actions are listed in the top section while all his behaviors are listed below. When you activate this villain, you would follow its behavior list from behavior 1 through 5 then complete its activation.\nFor a better look at the contents of an adventure, download the demo rulebook below or give it a shot on Tabletop Simulator!   \nThis guide is a work in progress.\nActual prototype shown above.\nThe Sovereignty Stage is an optional game mode where players can take the armies of their favorite runelords and mix them into a resource-management, deck-building engine where players take turns purchasing cards over twelve rounds of play. Purchasing is done from three available markets: The Barracks, The Armory, and The Training Grounds. Along the way, journey cards are drawn where dangerous encounters, exciting events, and aggressive PvP cards can dramatically change the outcome of a player's resources. \nPHASES OF A ROUND\nDRAW: All players draw and reveal five cards.\nJOURNEY: Beginning with the first player, each player draws a single Journey card, then resolves its contents. If the card being drawn has the PvP card back, only that single card is drawn and all players perform its contents together!\nPURCHASE: Beginning with the first player, players may purchase a single card from the available markets or they may pass. After each player has passed or purchased, restock the markets and begin again until all players have either passed or can no longer afford to purchase.\nDISCARD/RESTOCK: All players discard any remaining cards from their hands and restock all markets.\nActual prototype shown above.\nWHY THE DECK BUILDER?\nThough it's optional, the deck builder mode allows players to create countless new combos by mixing their runelord's cards with the cards from other runelords' armies. As new runelords are introduced in future expansion, old runelords will get a new lease on life, expanding the game's replayability for years to come!\nPLAY\n\nNOTE: Battlefield/Adventure Add On is set as an $85k stretch goal.\nActual prototype shown above.\nYou may be asking: \"What is a runelord?\" \nWho better to answer that than the creator himself, author David Farland?\n Here's an interview with David Farland and game design John D'Angelo:\nRunelords take qualities like strength, intelligence, and beauty from their willing vassals. As runelords do this, they became stronger as their vassals become weak and infirm. But there's a catch! The Runelord must keep the vassals safe, lest they lose their powers. \nVIDEOS\nDoug of 2+Tough breaks down what he thinks makes The Runelords stand out.\nMark Streed from Dice Tower goes into the biggest changes from the first campaign. \n Unfiltered Games gives the rundown on The Runelords and gives a live playthrough!\n Not_A_Superhero learns the game in real-time!\nGloryhoundd presents a quick overview of theme and gameplay!\nJoin Mike from One Stop Co-Op Shop as he attempts to tackle The Unrighteous King Adventure solo!\nThe Battle Cast breaks down what makes The Runelords so unique and helps answer the question: Should You Play?  \nThe Hungry Gamer discusses the evolution of The Runelords.   \nARTICLES and PODCASTS\nGabe and John go over the value of community feedback.\nCheck out this interview with Board Game Halv!\nA fun episode where designers John J.

As such, we're well aware of the common bottlenecks in Kickstarter fulfillment. We also are well aware of the supply chain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSo with this in mind, here's what we're going to do to make sure you get your game on-time and in mint condition:\n\nWe have an active relationship with our manufacturer. We've had prototypes created and we can vouch for their quality. As soon as the campaign funds, we're ready to manufacture the game. That includes stretch goals too - every single additional goal has been vetted so we can confidently fulfill on-time and within our budget.\n\nSlow shipping is also a common problem. That's why we've chosen our domestic and international shipping partners very carefully. We've scoured online reviews and have contacted some of their current clients to make sure they're up to the task.\n\nHave a concern that you don't see addressed above?

She also noticed that the selection of products offered for water activities lacked sophistication and a cultural connection. Alma Ocean is the first, Black-owned pool inflatable start-up with a mission of promoting inclusivity, creativity, and sustainability through the design and production of inflatable pools and water activity accessories.\nFounder + CEO, Danielle Hodge\n\nCREATIVITY: Inflatable pools should not only cool you off in the Summer, but they should create an experience and set a mood once placed and filled. Alma Ocean offers creative designs that will enhance any outdoor space and serve as the centerpiece to every backyard barbeque or balcony. \n\nSUSTAINABILITY: Alma Ocean believes in protecting the ocean, which is why upcycling is such a priority. Reusing and recycling inflatable pools and water products is a way to alleviate Alma Ocean\u2019s environmental imprint on this Earth. We have partnered with some of the best Upcycling Guru's worldwide to help us accomplish our goal of inflatables being a \"Forever\" product.\n  INCLUSIVITY: We want EVERYONE to enjoy the water and have access to swimming resources at their finger tips.  Alma Ocean offers resources for swimming lessons, surfing groups, and other water activities to encourage EVERYONE to safely get their feet wet. We empower swimmers and non swimmers to navigate through the water with confidence.\n\n WHY CROWDFUNDING:\nAlma Ocean is currently in the crowdfunding phase and early manufacturing phase. We are dedicated to offering countless varieties of inflatable pools and water product designs; however, financial limitations only allow for a small selection of designs to be available at this part of the process. With the help of donations from supporters, the capital raised will be used to manufacture current designs and expand to include additional design concepts for production. The crowdfunding capital is also being used for marketing, graphic designers, product shoots, media, and other production costs. Every dollar raised is a step towards the business goals and mission of Alma Ocean.\n\nWHERE WE PLAN TO GO:\nOnce the crowdfunding goal is reached, the capital received will be allocated in a variety of ways. This includes the production of the inflatable pool and water accessory designs that are currently available, and fulfilling orders generated from crowdfunding supporters. It will also be allocated towards marketing, graphic designers, product shoots, media, and other production costs. Additionally, Alma Ocean will use the capital raised to expand and grow its business. As the business grows, the product designs available will also grow.\nCulture Addict Inflatable Pool - Fits 3 adults comfortably.\nThe future of Alma Ocean is limitless. Its long-term plans include expanding product variety, evolving product design to incorporate innovative engineering, developing consumer connections, and increasing awareness for water safety. Alma Ocean strives to be the resource on everything related to water activities. Whether someone needs to learn how to swim, wants to enhance their swimming experience, or wants to upcycle their current water products, Alma Ocean will be their destination.\nIn production phase\n\nTo say thanks to everyone who makes a contribution to this campaign, we are offering Alma Ocean products through this campaign before we offer them anywhere else. Contribute now and help us create wealth in the black community \u2013 supporting a group of black entrepreneurs who are building a business that means something.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nIn addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for what we are doing by sharing a link to the campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people hear about Alma Ocean today, the smoother our launch is going to go.

Being in the water is healing for your mind, body, and soul. A little history on our OG leaf float, this one is special to us. We asked our designer to give us something that speaks to culture. He looked up leaf patterns in Africa and BOOM, low and behold the OG leaf float was born. We call this float OG because Its original and unique design left us with no choice but to put it at the top of our list. P.S.

Here lie the remnants of the First Born, an advanced civilization that conquered the galaxy long ago but have since been dormant, waiting for the younger species to take their first steps into space.\nThis sleep wasn\u2019t dreamless, and over the millennia the First Born were slowly driven mad. Fanatical and paranoid, they have learned to fear and despise the new species that they once longed for.\nWhen the Traders arrived in a seemingly abandoned asteroid field to pick over the bones of a long-dead people, the First Born were awoken\u2026\nCore Space: First Born is a sci-fi miniatures board game in which you control a band of Traders venturing into the ancient First Born temples. The game takes place on the highly- detailed 3D board included in the box. Your Traders must explore the area, fulfil their objectives, salvage what they can and then escape back to their ship, spending their earnings on desperately-needed repairs. The exciting campaign system will track your crew from game to game, developing their skills, upgrading their equipment and immersing you in their story.\nFirst Born is based on last year\u2019s cyberpunk bestseller Core Space (see \u2018What is Core Space?\u2019 below for full details) but is a fully standalone starter set playable by new and existing players alike. It retains the same simple core mechanics and our unique \u2018real search\u2019 system while seamlessly integrating this new and mysterious alien race.\nTo find out more about the gameplay, download the rules HERE or check out the playthrough videos further down the page.\nThe Crew of the Eidolon \u2013 these incredible characters are just some of the 32mm scale plastic minis included in the box (supplied unpainted).\nThis time the narrative campaign in the starter set is built for a single crew and playable co-op and solo \u2013 something that\u2019s long been requested for the game! It is of course fully compatible with the existing range of crews and expansions as well as our wide selection of terrain. All Core Space expansions and boosters are modular so you can mix and match them for a fully customisable experience, from a solo RPG-style adventure to a full-on 6-player PvP skirmish.\nTo win you will need to follow the Trader credo:\nSALVAGE // TRADE // ADAPT // SURVIVE\nCore Space is a fully self-contained skirmish game \u2013 everything you need to play the game, including a 2\u2019/60cm square neoprene mat covered in our award-winning modular terrain (no glue or paint required!), is included in the starter set. Established players will be excited to hear that all of the miniatures, terrain and equipment in the box are brand-new, expanding on the huge Core Space universe with never-seen-before settings, characters and stories.\nLet\u2019s find out a bit more about the two pledges on offer:\n You can find Xanadib's latest Pledge Calculator HERE.\nHave you been living under an asteroid?

Genetically engineered to be the most intelligent form of First Born; millions of years without stimulus has atrophied their once-great minds. In a real sense this has reduced them to little more than beasts, but they are extremely powerful and near indestructible.\nThis expansion includes one of these True Gods. It\u2019s the biggest miniature we have ever made for Core Space and stands over 120mm tall! It\u2019s designed to straddle the terrain, representing its phenomenal power to reform the living rock of the surrounding chambers it as it moves. Flanked by its two hulking Guardians and with brand-new missions to tell its story, this is a challenge your Traders can\u2019t afford to miss. \nThe Gates of Ry'sa are a network of interlinked portals to other worlds, times or alternate realities. The gates are not wormholes like Lagrange points nor tears in time and space like Core Space; instead the gates imprint a galactic 'map' on the traveller's own neural network to alter its place in time, space and reality.\nThe First Born primarily use the Gates to travel between asteroids within their own star system, and they keep this technology heavily guarded from intruders\u2026\nThe Gates of Ry\u2019sa is a brand-new expansion to Core Space First Born that adds these gates to the game along with some powerful new First Born threats \u2013 the Talos and the Cerberosa. See Update 11 for full details.\nThe new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders attempt to secure one of these gates for themselves before passing through it to reach yet more undiscovered treasures in the more distant First Born asteroid bases. New equipment and mining opportunities await amongst the incredible new terrain pieces included in this set. The gates are housed in enormous caverns large enough for all manner of creatures to come through, and the shifting colours in the energy pylons make for an eye-catching centrepiece to your gaming table. New event cards shuffled into the deck will represent the reality-shifting nature of the nearby gate.\nThe expansion can be added to your pledge for just \u00a331 (see Add-ons below for full details).\nTrading Post 5 is a waystation hastily established in a crater on an abandoned asteroid just beyond the Lagrange Point. Here an enterprising Captain can hire traders, mercenaries and other useful hands and stock up on fuel, machines, equipment and weapons in a eclectic bazaar of stores, workshops, bars and dens of iniquity.\nThe outpost attracts a colourful assortment of dubious characters and ne'er do wells; exactly the sort of tough, shifty types you'd expect in the final outpost before untold wealth or grisly death!\nTrading Post 5 is a new expansion for Core Space that brings the Traders back out of the asteroid temples and introduces a host of new characterful NPCs. See Update 21 for full details.\nThe new narrative campaign in the expansion will see your Traders visit the Trading Post hoping for a big score from their recently acquired alien loot. They can peruse the stores, meet with contacts, and even recruit new Traders to their cause. However, the aliens that they so rudely awakened have followed them back\u2026 Can they defend the settlement from its attackers trying to reclaim their asteroid home?\nThe new terrain in the set forms part of Trading Post 5 and is made up of shops and cargo in pre-fab containers. The expansion is populated by new NPCs, including Civilians, a lone Galactic Corps agent, the Ganger proprietor of the Trading Post, and four new playable Traders!\nThe expansion can be added to your pledge for just \u00a331 (see Add-ons below for full details).\nTo add an item to your pledge, simply increase the total amount of your pledge by the cost of the item.

The next stage is getting them tooled and produced, with many samples stages along the way to ensure quality. We predict that we will begin shipping in autumn 2021. However, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China, especially if any components do not meet our high quality standards during production. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nBy backing this campaign you acknowledge that the final product may vary slightly from the prototypes shown in the images, due to tooling tolerances or artwork improvements during production. We will notify backers of any major changes should they occur.\n\nWe are aiming to deliver this Kickstarter in full in advance of the retail release date.

Be careful though, as an alliance can only last so long. Only one player can be crowned the most victorious. Be ready to strategize, calculate, backstab and deceive the other players to victory.\nEach player takes a set of 5 Ships and 5 Cargo cards in the color of their choice.  Each player places their Cargo in front of themselves in a row, with the value face down.  Players can place their Cargo cards in any order they choose.  Place a Ship card on top of each Cargo card, with the Ship side up.\nShuffle the main deck, deal 5 cards to each player face down.  Place the remaining cards face down in the center of the play area.\nThe player that travelled the furthest today goes first.\nPlayers take turns in clockwise order.  The active player may take any of the following actions in any order.\nPlay a single Crisis card\nPlay Crew cards\nPlay Command cards\nTrade card(s) with other players\n  A player that plays no cards, may discard their entire hand.\nAfter each turn, the active player will check for Crisis that still has a Crisis card attached. If that player ends their turn with a Crisis card attached to a SHIP, that SHIP is destroyed and its Cargo is lost.  The Cargo attached to that Ship will not be counted towards their score at the end of the game. The active player then draws from the Main Deck until they have 5 cards in hand, before proceeding to the next player.\n\n\n\nAfter you complete all of your actions, your turn ends.  Any of your Ships with Crisis cards still attached are now destroyed.  Flip over the affected ship, revealing the destroyed side, leaving the cargo in place underneath it.  Discard the Crisis card and any Crew cards that were attached to that ship.\nDestroyed Ships are out of play for the rest of the game.  The attached Cargo underneath the destroyed Ship must remain concealed and will not count towards your final score.\nAfter removing any destroyed Ships, draw from the main deck until you have 5 cards in hand.\nThe game ends when a single player's entire fleet is destroyed.  Everyone else will score points for Cargo attached to their Ships that are not destroyed.\nPlayers will flip over their undestroyed Cargo and total up the points.  The player with the highest sum of points is the winner.\nIf multiple players have the same sum of points, the player with the most intact Ships wins the tie.  If there is still a tie, the player with the most Crew cards attached to their Ships wins the tie.\nSpace TrailBlazer: Standard Game- Backing this reward will get you a copy of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals with an early bird discount.\nStandard Game - Backing this reward will get you a copy of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals.\nSharing is Caring - Backing this reward will get you two copies of Captain\u2019s Log: Crisis Detected and access to all our unlocked stretch goals.\nShare the Love - Double the fun!

With decision branching, you\u2019ll be able to make choices while you listen that could change your story\u2014just like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. \nForteller\u2019s previous work includes Gloomhaven, Frosthaven, Jaws of the Lion, and The Isofarian Guard. So, your legend is in safe hands!\nListen to a sample of Forteller Games' audio for Bardsung:\nBecause Bardsung can be played as a campaign game, the custom Game Trayz insert (unlocked on Day 1) will keep everything from your core box organised between play sessions\u2014so you can pick up right where you left off.\nImage shown is for illustration purpose only. Actual product may vary due to product enhancement.\nLegends are heroes who have adventures worth singing about.\nIn a world where being sung of by bards is the mark of a true hero, you begin with a single tile, a destination, and the desire to become songworthy. What unfolds is a labyrinthine dungeon of your creation, filled with dangerous enemies, wandering monsters, challenging puzzles, and valuable treasure.\n\nThe immersion of roleplaying games meets the elegance of board game mechanics in an epic 50+ hour campaign. \nInspired by dungeon-crawling and roleplaying classics, Bardsung is a cooperative dungeon explorer for 1-5 players that combines the best elements of both with contemporary gameplay to create a powerful new experience.\nInspire the songs.\nDescend into the depths of an ancient forge, building your dungeon and creating your legend as you explore\u2014with no game master needed. As you venture through the ruined halls, you'll face the strange and terrible creatures that call the darkness home...\nLive your legend.\nFrom your path through the dungeon to the growth of your character into a fabled hero, the decisions you make and directions you take will evolve your story.\nBecome Bardsung.\nWith multiple potential paths through the depths, you can always return to take a different route. Play through again and again, hero. The ancient forge is a warren of secrets waiting to be discovered, and your legend is just beginning!\n Bardsung is a game of pathways. \nFrom your physical journey through the ancient forge to your metaphorical journey of building your character into a fabled hero, your choices define your experience.\nExplore the dungeon in standalone sessions, or as part of a narrative campaign that evolves based on your decisions.\nEach dungeon has a way in and a way out. The journey between is up to you.\nWith swift setup, a procedurally generated dungeon, and easy-to-grasp mechanics taught by an intuitive tutorial-based rulebook, your descent into the depths will be quick...\n\nTo hasten your descent, the hero you choose will have a starting role in the party\u2014but how they progress is up to you. You have the freedom to either follow their suggested path, or create your own bespoke hero with a unique set of traits and arsenal of attack combos.\nRead more on Levelling Up\nA classless path system lets you build the hero you want, your way.

Because each adventure includes its own dungeon and takes around 45-90mins to play, adventures can be played as one shots or as part of a campaign.\nRegardless, the choices you make while exploring will change your story, from the secrets you uncover to the way the adventure ends\u2014which, in campaign play, leads you to the next adventure...\nIn a hidden vault, you\u2019ll find set cards that are unlocked by your choices as your game goes on. Perhaps you find a dwarf prisoner, chained to a wall. Free them, and you\u2019ll draw a numbered card from the vault and shuffle into one of the decks.

Aspect decks evolve with your campaign, and can create lasting and long-ranging effects.\nRead more about the Aspect Decks\nAs you walk the ruined halls, you'll face strange creatures that call the darkness home. \nControlled by simple and intuitive AI, enemy behaviours are varied and quick to resolve. Be wary, for enemy behaviour will change as you move deeper into the forge and your foes adapt to your presence.\nJust like your hero, enemies can level up, evolve their attacks, and can even learn to hold grudges against heroes who defeat them.\nEnter intelligent and dangerous combat featuring cooperative combo play that goes beyond simply moving toward an enemy and rolling dice each turn. \nIn a zone-based system that emphasises freedom of movement, teamwork and positioning are vital to solving the combat puzzles created by battle aspect cards, which are unique to each encounter.\nBattle aspect cards modify combat encounters. Be wary of cards that grant enemies more dangerous attacks, such as poisoned weapons, or add more enemies through either a sudden ambush or time-delayed reinforcements. \nYou'll need to adapt to the changing state of play, hero\u2014but your abilities can't be used over and over, so choose your moment wisely!\nRead more about Combat\nRound length, turns, and enemy activations are governed by a dynamic marching order that will keep you on your toes, encouraging you to adopt strategies that control the ebb and flow of initiative.\nThe marching order determines initiative each round and refreshes each turn. Combat can be unpredictable\u2014the marching order is a second battleground you can use to control the chaos, so manipulate it to your advantage!\nRead more about the Marching Order\nPerform heroic deeds to gain fate that can be used to power special abilities. Any fate you earn is shared amongst your party, so working together is key.\n\nAnd speaking of fate, darkness can descend with the roll of a die. \nAs you build your dungeon, you may find yourself needing to double back\u2014perhaps you missed some loot, or an aspect card triggered an earthquake that blocked your route.\nYet turning back may not be so simple. The dungeon may be yours to explore, but you aren't the only inhabitants. Wandering monsters stalk the halls, their movements signalled by echo tokens that come ever closer. \nKept at bay only by closed doors, the nature of the beast won't be revealed until the last moment...\nRead more about Wandering Monsters and Mini Bosses\nExploration\nCombat\nAspect Decks\nMarching Order\nWandering Monsters\nLevelling Up Heroes\nExample Hero Builds\nWeapons & Equipment\nCampaign System\nAlternative Endings\nMini Bosses\n\nEverything you get in Bardsung: Legend of the Ancient Forge!\n\nWe\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs.

Keep in mind that these costs could change based on the total number of stretch goals unlocked during the campaign. Once the campaign is finished and you\u2019ve confirmed your address and any add-ons, your accurate shipping cost will be calculated in the pledge manager.\nSadly, due to customs, import laws, and other restrictions, Steamforged is unable to ship pledge rewards to these locations (see point 10 of terms).\nBecause of the size of the package, we\u2019re also unable to ship to P.O. Boxes.\nKeep in mind that any pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from our UK hub at a later date. For non-UK backers, this will likely increase shipping costs.\nFor the regions listed as \u2018friendly shipping\u2019, we cover any VAT or sales tax charges. So, those are accounted for in the pledge price and shipping estimations. \n                                                               Backers in other regions will be liable for any VAT or sales taxes which may be applied in their own countries. There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin. Because circumstances are different from project to project, this timeline is estimated based on our experience.\nWe want to get your rewards into your hands as soon as possible. Because of the potential for unexpected effects on planning and production schedules, there\u2019s a chance you might not get your rewards before the game is available at retail.

You can then spend the Credits to do extra actions.\nThe Ghost Piece expansion adds 24 new puzzles with unique shapes and new reward mechanics. There are also 3 new types of level-5 pieces, the Ghost Pieces. This expansion enhances the replayability of Project L and opens new strategic options for you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Add-ons?

It\u2019s because of your continuous involvement and interest in our games that we amass enough energy and motivation to push our projects further ahead. As a thank you, we\u2019re including a special promo pack in all our Kickstarter campaigns that our ambassadors get for free!\nYou will automatically receive Project L: Finesse Ambassador Pack for free if:\nYou have pledged during the first 72 hours of the campaign,\nYou have supported any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns, or\nYou were subscribed to our newsletter before this Kickstarter campaign launched.\n\n  Looking back to the original campaign in 2018, Project L went a long way. Two years ago, thanks to the support of all the amazing backers, we've fully unlocked all Stretch Goals that allowed us to produce the game in a shape and quality we had never dreamed of. There's not much that could be added or upgraded \u2014 just look at what the backers and reviewers say!\nWhen it comes to the Finesse expansion, we had no other option than to follow the quality of Project L & Ghost Piece (not that we wouldn't like that), so Finesse is already coming to Kickstarter in a super-maximized mode.\nWe prefer to not add anything superficial, untested, or not fitting the content that's been originally planned for the game. And since mostly everything has been already added to the game, the inevitable result is that this campaign is Stretch Goal free.\nOn the other hand, the journey towards making Project L a reality has been so exciting that we just love the idea of sharing it with you in full detail (in even more detail than that the backers of the original campaign remember!). To accomplish that, we\u2019ve prepared a series of behind-the-scenes stories as well as making-of interviews.\nStay tuned for the project updates!\nSince the original campaign from 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with Paul Grogan from Gaming Rules!, a professional rulebook writer & editor, to enhance and streamline the way you can learn to play Project L. Furthermore, focusing on the feedback we\u2019ve received since the first version of the game, we\u2019ve also perfected the rules in terms of game mechanics\u2014mostly concerning the player actions and endgame. \nCheck out the Revised Rules 2.0 (WIP).\nPrinted Revised Rulebook (2.0):\n comes automatically with all pledge levels! So, if you're a backer of the original campaign and are now pledging for the Returning Backer rewards (just the Finesse expansion), you'll receive the physical revised rulebook 2.0 as well.\nincludes the rules of Project L (base game) and all expansions in a single book.\nincludes updated player aids,\nis printed on premium soft-touch paper (that you know from the original campaign).\nis available in English only (see below for more details).\nWe're proud to announce that Asmodee will localize and manufacture Project L (base game) and also distribute it in retail.\nIf you're interested in a localized retail version of the base game, get in touch with your local branch of Asmodee for details about if/when they are releasing Project L in your country and/or language. Since the localization is now in the hands of Asmodee, we're no longer allowed to produce non-English versions of the game.\nPlease note, however, that the retail version by Asmodee and this Kickstarter version by Boardcubator are two separate product lines run by two separate companies. While there's a good chance that the content of one will be compatible with the other, we cannot guarantee that.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager.\nFriendly Shipping \u2014 We offer friendly shipping to the EU, US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Backers from these regions won't spend additional money on customs or other import fees. Based on any given region, we will either ship your reward directly from within the country or will fully cover all potential import fees you might get charged for. \nAdditional Copy Shipping Discount \u2014 If you're interested in getting an additional copy of Project L or one of the expansion, you will spare on shipping for the subsequent copy thanks to reduced rates. Check the table for the discount.\n\nIf you're interested in getting an additional copy of the game, check out the Shipping section for shipping discounts.\nBigger Groups \u2014 If you\u2019d like to pledge for even more copies, get in touch with us at sales@boardcubator.com and we'll get back to you with a special offer.\nJan \"Suki\" Soukal \u2014 Co-founder of Boardcubator who left his day job in IT security a few years ago to become an independent board game creator.

However, we believe that with the experience we have from the previous campaigns, we will successfully overcome any obstacles that might come up.\n\n\u20ac1 PLEDGE \u2014 If you aren\u2019t decided which pledge level you want, just rewrite the pledge amount to \u20ac1.

Rulebooks, game boxes, player aids, and puzzle boards have scratch resistant varnish or lamination that ensures that these components will last a long time under frequent use. Based on hundreds of rounds of playtesting, we have gradually improved the technological aspect of puzzle boards into their current 5-layer structure.\n\nThe base game is readily expandable without the need to make any component changes or upgrades to the base game that would require releasing a new version of the game. All expansions of the game can be mixed together.\nReusability and recyclability\nGiven the durability and material quality of the components in the game, Project L will last a long time before it starts showing signs of use or general material deterioration. In the rare case a component gets damaged, we will provide replacement parts.\nSustainable materials\nProject L holds Verification of Conformity according to the EU Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC, which declares the game as safe for children and parents to play with and also verifies that there are no physical / mechanical, flammability, or chemical risks.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPanda GM, the manufacturer of Project L pays extreme attention to worker comfort and safety standards with a fully air-conditioned environment, while being BSCI social compliance certified and following the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.\nSustainable Distribution\nBased on our previous experience with successfully fulfilling Kickstarter projects, we are constantly optimizing the shipping routes to make sure that the distance the game travels is as short as possible. We use several distribution hubs and fulfillment companies to make sure that packages are shipped in bulk where possible before the last mile delivery to our backers.

For this reason, we have carefully selected our manufacturers and with them we are committed to optimizing and defining every single content of the Soulgivers box according to high standards, both for the prints and for the game elements.\n\nWe give particular importance to the chosen finishes and materials, because we want the visual and physical aspect of the game to be part of the experience itself. But we are also putting all of our energies into this project. All of our energies go to a collaboration with an Italian company that has been dealing with imports for over 40 years, which financed the first prototypes and financially supported Soulgivers to get to where we are today. With their experience, we are confident that we can better manage any aspect of production and imports from China, with the upmost attention to safety, with Quality Control on site. \n\nWe believe in our project so much that we have opened a company dedicated to the design of board games, operational since July 2020: Gravity Games. \n\nMoreover, today Soulgivers is already in an advanced phase of its production.

See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company.\nINTERNATIONAL DELIVERY NOTE: No physical rewards are offered to international backers. If the project closes successfully, we will offer the Random Fun Generator book through Amazon's print-on-demand service*, which will make it cheaper for you to purchase the print books (shipping will cost a lot less).\nWe continue to search for reliable, economical solutions to international Kickstarter delivery.\n* As a perfect-bound book, not a wire-bound title.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSteve Jackson Games is an established game publisher with a successful track record and we have enough Kickstarter experience to deal with issues should they arise.

To reduce the chance of delays, we are limiting physical rewards to U.S. only.\n\nNow it's time for you to tell us whether or not to complete the project.

See below for the full box contents.\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is a stand-alone multi-player sequel to the original solitaire game Deep Space D-6.\nIn Deep Space D-6: Armada, you and up to 3 friends will work together to complete missions, fight enemy fleets in ship to ship combat, and ultimately defeat an evil federation. \nYou'll get stronger as the game progresses, building the perfect starship from over 50 station modules, hiring heroes from a pool of more than 30 unique units, and finding resources to help you dismantle your opposition. \nArmada is a complex and deep game made simple and intuitive through visual and user experience design. If you've played Deep Space D-6 before, you'll be immediately familiar with the mechanics of Armada. If you're new to the series- I hope you're ready for tough decisions and tactical planning! \nDeep Space D-6: Armada is played over a series of game rounds. Each round consists of three phases:\n\n1) Planning: Players perform actions to travel between planets and prepare for upcoming tasks such as upgrading their ships or hiring Heroic crew.\n2) Encounter: Players complete Away Missions or combat enemy fleets at their current location (together or alone).\n3) Resolution: Event and Threat Detected cards are drawn and hazard effects are resolved. \n Learn more about the game in upcoming updates:\nThe Starships (Update #2)\nStations Modules and Weapons (Update #4)\nCrew and Special Abilities (Update #6)\nTeam-Up encounters (Update #8)\nRule Book\nWant to know more? Check out the prototype rulebook. This is a work-in-progress rulebook and is subject to change. \n PHASE 1: Planning\nTravel, repair, upgrade ship, hire crew.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 2: Encounter\nShip-to-ship combat and Away Missions.\nPLAY\n\nPHASE 3: Resolution \nDraw new event cards, spawn enemies, resolve hazard effects.\nPLAY\n\nCreating a science fiction world where the primary color wasn't black proved to be a large challenge. As a lover of classic science fiction, I was drawn to the bright colors and \"loudness\" of pulp era sci-fi. A true test of Armada's visual direction came from designing the board- or lack thereof. \nA space themed game without the empty blackness of space almost felt wrong, and for some people they probably won't be able to get over it! So Armada uses free floating planet tiles making whatever surface you play on the core color of the \"board\". Still want that dark sci-fi feel? Play on a neoprene star field map. Want to feel like you're floating in space? Try a glass table! \nFor the art, I've enlisted in the help of Gareth Davies. Gareth's unique art style creates a vibrant science fiction world while keeping things minimal and clean. \nFor the components themselves, I aimed for a classic board game look with a slight vintage feel. There are over 50 custom dice in this game!  We're taking advantage of new manufacturing technologies, but don't want to go overboard with component gimmicks. \nGet the full game as a $2 add-on!\nJUMPSHIP is a hidden identity party game for 5-10 players. You can get a copy of the mini-version for $2 with your Armada pledge. Just add $2 to you pledge. See the update for more info (Not available by itself. Limit 1 copy per copy of Armada).\nNo stretch goals. Tau Leader Games does not do Kickstarter exclusives. We fully develop our games and don't piece parts out to be added as stretch goals later.\nBut with your help and community feedback, I've been able to redesign and upgrade the shield and hull trackers! They look like this now:\nOther upgrades:\nA dedicated solo scenario meant for quicker play.\nCustom plastic insert for the hero dice.\nBlack Core cardstock on all cards.\nDrawstring bag for beacon tokens.\nPrinted player pawns (instead of stickers)\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. Thanks to the funding progress of this campaign, I've been able to lower shipping rates.\nGames will be shipped though fulfillment partners primarily in Canada, China, the EU, the US, and Australia. This should reduce custom fees and VAT. Shipping rates are partially subsidized. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies by adding $48 for each additional game to your pledge. There will be no extra shipping charge for extra copies. \nFor larger orders (cases of 6+) or retailer pledges, please inquire by sending a message to the creator.\nTabletop games are becoming more and more popular every year. We as consumers (and designers too!) employ platitudes and conjecture comparing the increased complexity and immersion of board games to the capabilities of video games. If we are to make these comparisons, we must also recognize the dangers of any consumer-focused game mediums. Publishers have a responsibility to be morally accountable for any practices that manipulate fans, deceive consumers, or incite misbehavior among those that partake in our hobby. Deceptive pricing schemes, endless boxes of collectible miniatures, nickel & dime expansion structures, undisclosed kickbacks, even player toxicity- these are just a few areas of growing concern within the emerging tabletop industry. Please take a moment to consider how your purchasing habits and use of games reflect on the industry, whether it is my games or someone else's. \nNever forget that tabletop games are a place for communion, self-expression, can have positive effects on our health and mind, and can lead to wonderful careers and societal impact. As an independent publisher I'm committed to creating games that respect players, and delivering them with practices that are healthy for the community. \nHave fun and play nice. \nJoin the Armada today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeep Space D-6: Armada is my most ambitious and largest game to date. Though the game is already designed, we continue to balance and add new features. There is also a non-trivial amount of art assets to be completed. These things will take time. \n\nThis will be my 6th Kickstarter game project. I've been all over the place- let me tell you. From last-second funding escapades to projects far exceeding my own projections and everything in between. This means I've also seen failures and made mistakes. I've been late to hit deadlines. I've been unresponsive when I needed communication the most. I take full responsibility for my actions and hope people will be fair in judgement and understanding. I am fully aware that being an individual does not necessitate leniency in a market full of large companies and publishers with impressive capabilities. Let's just do our best to be reasonable and keep the spirit of independent self-publishing alive!\n\nTauLeaderGames has a 100% delivery rate but every project still has inherent risks. October 2020 is my best estimate for a project of this scope based on my past experience. While this timeframe includes room for errors and overages, it doesn't encapsulate every possible obstacle.

Play as one of four street urchins each with their own book and a different talent that will make your personal experience differ from that of the other players.\n Play multiple cases (4) as you explore the mean streets of London and experience hours of case-solving fun.\n A multi-player gamebook experience... if you always wished you could share your gamebook experiences with your friends than you are going to absolutely love our cooperative Graphic Novel Adventures games and this game takes it to a whole new level.\nSo how does it all work?\nSherlock has some casework for the Irregulars. It is up to you, to prove your worth.\nYou'll each choose one of the four Irregulars (it is ok if you have fewer players and only choose some, or even one!).\nWiggins has begun to master the art of deduction under Holmes's tutelage.\nMyrtle is a master of disguise and can help the Irregulars slip past all but the most observant.\nIke is particularly good at throwing a beatdown on foes of the Irregulars, or providing some muscle.\nVicky is an expert at climbing and acrobatics, allowing her to spot things for the group.\nNow you are ready to play! Select a Mission from the mission book and set out across London to solve the mystery.\nPlayers will need to be on the lookout for how their special skill can help the group.\nClick to see a larger version!\nAfter you've completed a mission decide to move on to the next or save your place and continue later.\nFor the first time, you can see where it all began. The entire line of Sherlock GNAs take place after the famed dive off of Reichenbach Falls, where Sherlock and Moriarty allegedly plunged to their deaths. Now you can see what happened after those incredible events, and how Sherlock got back in the investigatory saddle, through the eyes of his trusted friend, Dr. Watson.\nSherlock trusts you to prove your deductive prowess and solve cases that have left Inspector Lestrade, and Scotland Yard, puzzled to say the least. Be careful though, not only are your investigations perilous, but Sherlock himself has little tolerance for failure. However you choose to go about solving the mysteries, as always, it's your story, your choices, and your adventure.\nWe want to make this as simple as possible, so there are just three options for pledging.\nWe know it's holiday season, and many of us are running around looking for the perfect gift still.

We have this handy holiday certificate for you, so you can have something to give one of those special people in your life while they wait to crack the case on Baker Street.\nClick on the image for a Hi-Res download.\nThe game has multiple missions to experience.

Equipped for a twenty-year voyage, she will carry the Travellers on an epic journey from Charted Space to the edge of the Orion Arm. Deepnight Revelation must forge a path through uncharted systems and the territory of unknown alien races. Everything she finds will be new, and if she meets with disaster there will be no rescue.\nDeepnight Revelation\u2019s destination is a mysterious radio source at the mouth of the Great Rift. Described in the ravings of a madwoman as the place beyond everything, Terminus Point holds a terrible secret. Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have always delivered on our Kickstarter projects and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of previous Traveller projects such as The Great Rift, the Element Class Cruiser Blueprints or JTAS, we believe you would hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it, and you tend to end up with more than you originally pledged for!\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure Deepnight Revelation does not overrun its projected completion date.\n\nFor a start, much of the work has already been done on the box set, and the first adventure in the set has already entered the art and layout process - you can freely download what has been completed for free using the link above.\n\nSecond, we have brought in fan favourite Martin J Dougherty, to pen the campaign.

It has such a fun feeling while playing, it\u2019s light-hearted, it plays solo, it plays up to 4 and you can talk a lot of smack while laying out Traps. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s the perfect roll and write to play at the pub or with the brunch bunch.\"\n\n\nBoardgames & Bourbon shows off Deadly Doodles and notes that the game is for a younger crowd . . . agreed!

For this campaign, international delivery is estimated as up to three months after United States delivery due to the complexity and time required to transport packages from the U.S. to other nations.

For a very limited time, the datasphere is revealing secrets. Backers only: check out this update to access the vertice and see what secrets the datasphere is revealing!\n\n\nExplore a vast new realm. Uncover never-before-revealed secrets of how the ancients shaped the Ninth World. Face the legacy of those secrets\u2014and, possibly, the utter destruction of the Ninth World.\nThe Numenera: Liminal Shores Kickstarter seeks to fund three thematically linked, hardcover sourcebooks containing all new material for the award-winning phenomenon of the Numenera tabletop RPG. \nOver a billion years into the Earth's future, great civilizations have risen and fallen, each attaining wonders beyond our wildest dreams and furthest imaginings. The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a beautiful but weird place of both wonder and danger. \nYou have explored ruins of the ancient past and found the magic there called the numenera. You have wandered the Steadfast and the Beyond, to discover cities and peoples you never knew existed. You have dived the ocean deeps and found that there, too, lie wonders of the past. Perhaps you have even followed in the footsteps of the prior worlds and voyaged to the stars, or beyond. \nBut the Ninth World still has more unexplored places. One of them is all around us, even now. It\u2019s a network of ancient information, sustained by machines far above our heads circling the world far overhead. And it\u2019s much more than that. It is knowledge and secrets, but it\u2019s also a sort of place. A conceptual space. The datasphere.\nUp until now, people have only caught glimmers of the datasphere. But recently access points, called vertices, have been discovered. Those who find these access points can use them to explore a metaphysical space and plumb the depths of its mysteries. Further, they can use them to learn of new discoveries in the real world. Whole new lands to explore. And even to uncover the mysteries of the prior worlds, and the grand actions that took place aeons ago, affecting the Earth, the Sun, and the other planets. Actions that have an impact\u2014perhaps a massive impact\u2014on our world today.\nNumenera is a game about exploration and discovery. The three new hardcover books offered in this Kickstarter campaign give you all-new methods of exploration and incredible discoveries to be made. They will take your campaign to new heights while embracing the game\u2019s core focus. \nThis Kickstarter will help us launch three new hardcover sourcebooks for Numenera:\nVoices of the Datasphere\nNo other aspect of the Ninth World evokes as much wonder\u2014and generates as many questions from Numenera players\u2014as the datasphere. This hardcover sourcebook delves into the datasphere, making its mysteries yours to command!\nVoices of the Datasphere opens up a whole new aspect of game play, where characters interface with and explore the reaches of the datasphere. This strange new metaspace is not just an ancient alien data network, but in fact multiple such networks\u2014some damaged, incomplete, or aged or evolved past their original purpose\u2014created by myriad civilizations and interacting in unexpected ways. The datasphere offers knowledge to be learned, treasures to be discovered, and wholly new challenges to be overcome. \nLiminal Shore\nThis hardcover Numenera sourcebook offers a new land in the Ninth World, discovered only through clues found in the datasphere. What new people live there? What wonders do they command? Do they know more about the mysterious prior worlds than you do? Do they have cyphers and artifacts never before seen by anyone from the Steadfast or the Beyond? Liminal Shore will offer answers to all these questions, plus new creatures, new NPCs, and new adventures for your Numenera campaign. Be the first to explore a whole new land!\nEdge of the Sun\nThe sun\u2019s luminosity is increasing: a billion years from now, it should have all but swallowed the Earth. So how does the Ninth World even exist? And what happened to the planet Mercury? How, and why, was our world engineered to survive this long?\nThe beings of the prior worlds clearly did . . . something. And now, thanks to discoveries made in the datasphere, the PCs can find out what happened unimaginably long ago, and how those discoveries are vitally important to events transpiring even now.\nEdge of the Sun offers a jaw-dropping, entirely new adventuring locale out in the infinite void, and thrilling, epic, adventures that potentially affect the entirety of the Ninth World itself. Although it can be a part of any Numenera campaign, if you were ever looking for an incredible finale, this would fit the bill!\nAnd perhaps, with stretch goals, we will unlock even more books and additions to the game . . . \n\nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nNEW TO THE NINTH WORLD: This is a great level to take if you're just discovering Numenera and want to give it a try. The Numenera Starter Set has everything you need to start playing, and because it's an existing product, we'll ship your copy within weeks of the close of this campaign. But note: This backer level doesn't include the titles we're funding through this Kickstarter. To get those, you'll need to add them on (see Add-Ons, below). Or for the best deal, choose a different level and then add on the Numenera Starter Set.\nALL THREE PDFS: This is the level to choose if you just want the PDFs of the key titles being funded by this campaign.\nINTO THE DATASPHERE: Choose this level if you want PDFs of the three key titles from this campaign, plus PDFs of the follow-up titles that we hope to unlock through stretch goals. (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know we usually unlock a number of additional titles.) For the best deal, though, ONTO LIMINAL SHORES gives you all the same titles in print and PDF.\nALL THREE BOOKS: This is the level to choose if you want the hardcovers of the key titles\u2014plus you also get the PDFs.\nONTO LIMINAL SHORES: Choose this level if you want both the PDF and print versions of three key titles from this campaign, as well as all of the follow-up titles we hope to unlock through stretch goals. Who knows how far the campaign will go and what will get added by the end? (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know this will become a great deal.)\nAUTOGRAPHS: The same great deal as ONTO LIMINAL SHORES, but you get a hand-signed autographed bookplate with each book.\nPLAYTEST AND EARLY ACCESS: Just like with the ONTO LIMINAL SHORES level, you get everything this campaign unlocks, but you also get early access to the material and autographed bookplates for each title. Basically, you\u2019ll get the material when the playtesters do, and if you want you can provide feedback from your playtests like they do. You\u2019re not obligated to do so, though\u2014you can also just select this level and gain access to the manuscripts early. \nRetailers: The LIMINAL RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many Numenera products are right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you two copies each of the three titles funded by this campaign (Voices of the Datasphere, Liminal Shore, and Edge of the Sun). You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Numenera point-of-purchase promo kit. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping. \n\nAdd-ons are additional items you add to your reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-on items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. It also lets you, the backer, redeem them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or (if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase) you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop using the email address you gave us in BackerKit. Once you\u2019ve logged on to your MCG Shop account, you\u2019ll go to your Coupons page, and you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. \nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the UK. United Kingdom backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but due to Brexit uncertainty we cannot at this time promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the fifteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Pledge now for all four decks. \n Update #16 - PDF news.  \nThe Dossier Deck campaign introduces a series of tools for game masters to create, customize, and populate their games with detailed system neutral NPC's. To launch this new line, SkeletonKey Games is creating three unique card decks; Merchants, Mages, Commoners, and Orcs & Goblins. Each 51-card deck is a stand-alone accessory capable of producing over 4,000 different combinations. You can combine all three decks to open up over 100,000 variations. \nNow with four decks to choose from. Better yet, choose them all!\nEach Dossier Deck contains three different card types; Appearance cards, Traits cards, and Story Hook cards. Simply shuffle each card type into its own mini-deck and draw one card of each type.\nEvery game master finds themselves in a pinch from time-to-time. It's actually part of the fun of being a game master. Dossier Decks provide a tool to help game masters springboard great roleplaying opportunities with their players. \nNeed a detailed alchemist for your players to interact with? Mix your Mages and Merchants decks and draw one out. In an instant you could have a temperamental gnome who distrusts humans and would make you a great deal if you could help him out with his rare feather collection.\nA goblin ambush makes for an great random encounter but how about an ambush lead by a stout goblin covered in boils that fears water and possesses a treasure that belongs to a far more powerful entity.\nNot a seat-of-your-pants kind of game master? Planning out a collection of unique NPCs has never been easier. Draw or select the cards for as many NPCs as you will need (and a few extras just in case) and store them in a 9-pocket card page. You can get three NPCs per sheet or six if you double side them! \n A. Appearance Card - The content of this card is perfect to share with players.\n B. NPC portrait.\n C. NPC name.\n D. A short descriptive blurb, perfect for reading aloud as a first impression to players.\n E. Traits Card - This card is focused on the character's personality and skills. It is perfect for guiding the game master in making the character unique.\n F. Trait text gives game-master-only insight into the character.\n G. A quote gives an example of something the character might say or a look at the overall way they speak.\n H. Story Hook Card - This card features inspiration for side quests, treasure, and extra drama in your story line.\n I. This text describes an item, place, or creature related to the character in some way.\n J. Art related to the content of the Story Hook card.\n K. The story hook text gives game masters a subplot that can be a springboard for adventures and side quests.\n L. Set Symbol and Card ID Number - If you decide to shuffle your sets together, you can keep track of which cards go with which set should you ever want to separate them back out.\n\n\nOnce SkeletonKey Games has produced this project, the final fulfillment will be handled by the great team over at Nord Games.\n Shipping: Estimated shipping rates are listed by region in the FAQ below.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSkeletonKey Games has run and delivered four Kickstarter campaigns.

His callous fingers ran tenderly across the anvil, he knew this was the last time he\u2019d ever see it. The thuul closed his eyes and thought about all the marvellous armours and weapons he had crafted in his smithy, deep within Voronoy-Kefas, and sighed. Then he turned to the beautiful Murgla resting upon the anvil, his masterpiece. The Mittraka-inlaid runes gleamed in the dying light from the Logi furnace, runes he had crafted and empowered, runes holding fragments of his own memory. \nHe closed his eyes and ran his fingers for the final time across the Murgles, feeling the holy power held within the runes. \nAs he opened his eyes again, the shadows in the smithy deepened. It was on the move. The Hunter. And Argothar was the only prey left in Voronoy-Kefas... \nRunes of Memory is an official campaign for Trudvang Chronicles, which will take the player characters across the Stormlands and the Oster Sea in search of a lost dwarven kingdom, Voronoy-Kefas. \nThe Campaign\nAges ago the dwarven kingdom of Voronoy-Kefas became hit with a terrible plague of madness. As thuul Argothar T\u00e9waz was also hit by this curse, he crafted a mystic rune and bound a part of his soul in a marvelous Murgles, hoping that one day a dwarven hero would come along and be able to unlock the Murgles' secrets.\nAfter being attacked by goblins the adventurers discover the Murgles of T\u00e9waz. Seeing it has unknown runes a Thuul is needed to interpret them. At the same time the bearer of the Murgles starts to have vivid dreams of grand caverns, great furnaces and dwarven smiths at work. As the adventurers learn about the Runes of Memory, they start to get leads as to where to find Voronoy-Kefas, the lost dwarven kingdom.\nTheir mission to find the kingdom takes them far and across dangerous lands and open seas. Once they find the secret entrance, they will find that the old kingdom is the home to skeletons and an intangible demon. To reclaim the kingdom and discover what happened to the dwarves in Voronoy-Kefas, the adventurers must face the demon along with their own darkest fears and nightmares. Only the most brave and clever heroes can prevail and help restoring Voronoy-Kefas til its former glory. \nPrinted version of this book is KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!\n Adventure: Curse of Runes \n Written by Max Herngren\nCover by Alvaro Tapia\nThe Thuuls etched great runes and magical wards all along the scarlet blade of the sword, for this new material was unknown to the dwarves and thus they were yet weary of it. The jewelers and artisans etched gemstones that shone like stars into its hilt and weaved its grip with the thick hide of the toughest tunnel hog in the kingdom. Forged from the boiling blood of dragons, every dwarf in Trudvang grew to fear its name. \nFor this runeblade bore a cruel destiny, and the king named it Krovabonh \u2013 \u201cIronblood.\u201d\nCurse of Runes is the tale of the characters\u2019 struggles to free themselves from an ancient curse cast upon them by primordial powers of fire and soot that dwell within a dwarven sword from the Age of Dreams. The journey will take them across Muspelheim, the home of the dwarves \u2013 deep into the heart of the fabled kingdom of Tvologoya and the molten core of Trudvang. \n\u201cYes, indeed.

In Catacombs Cubes, you take on the role of a Catacombs hero and compete to expand the small village into its full glory!\nUse wooden cubes to build unique structures, and then add them to the Village Grid. Put a tile in the right place to enable combos that can quickly turn the tide of a game.\nStrategic tile placement, efficient resource management, and timely combos will determine the victor!\nWe are excited to be releasing our first non-flicking game.

Additionally, some gameplay rules may have been altered.\n\n\nHow To Play\n Note: Only the English manual is available for download.\nThe Quarry\n   At the start of the game, the players choose whether they would like to play with dice or with tokens. The Quarry Foreman then draws or rolls the Quarry Offers, one for each player. During their turn, each player gets to pick a Quarry Offer.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\n\n                                      Each Quarry Offer allows a player to collect Cube Pieces or perform special actions, such as contribute to the town's Palace or transform one of their existing Cube Pieces.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nBuilding a Tile\n  Instead of drafting from The Quarry, players have the option to Build a Structure on their turn.\nPlayers can build either their Residence Tile, or one of the available tiles in the Village Plans. To build a structure, a player must have the adequate Cube Pieces in their Construction Yard or Warehouse to physically replicate the shape of the cubes on a blueprint. \nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nOnce built, the player places the tile in the Village Grid next to an existing tile. The player earns various rewards based on the structure they completed, and based on where they placed the tile.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nCoins\nPlayers can earn Coins when they build a structure in the town. Coins can be spent at any time during a player's turn which allow them to perform additional actions. Otherwise, saving coins can potentially earn players some Victory Points during the end game scoring.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nContributing to the Palace\n   Unlike other structures, the Palace is built over the course of the game by all players. Each contribution a player makes earns them some rewards. To contribute to the Palace, a player must get the Palace Action Token or spend a Red Coin.\n  Only the player that contributes the last cube to the Palace gets to actually add the palace to the town, and reaps extra rewards.\n  Animated GIFs may take a moment to load.\n End of the Game\nOnce the Village Grid has reached its maximum size, the game ends. The maximum size is determined by the number of players, for example, a 4 player game ends at a 4x5 Village Grid. \n Players who decided to hold on to their Coins for the end of the game will get extra Victory Points for having the most of one type of Coin.\nThe player with the most Victory Points wins!\nSupport\nFor customer support and inquiries: \nPlease email: ks@elzra.com\nPlease note also that we cannot respond to specific customer support requests on the comments page of this project.

If you want to know what I am up to in the future, the url WWW.FORW.DE is always going to forward to my latest project (or to my homepage, Twitter feed, etc., if I am not currently running a project). In addition, you can follow me on Twitter @KaiHerbertz\nThis Kickstarter campaign aims to expand Albedo - a space-themed  deckbuilding game. The base game is required in order to use the expansion. Therefore, this Kickstarter campaign also offers the Albedo base game in the reward levels.  \nThis expansion retains Albedo's innovations, for example space ship cards that can be rotated  to retrofit them or the extra decision layer at each planet. Albedo's simultaneous action selection results in minimum downtime and a uniform game length. In addition the expansion includes new planet cards, a new type of card, and a new faction.\nHere are a few how to play videos about the base game as well as a short explanation with images. The expansion adds a new playing style for the new faction, but the core mechanisms remain the same. \nDRAW 2 PLANET CARDS (3 PLANET CARDS WITH 5-8 PLAYERS)\nDRAW 6 UNIT CARDS\nEVALUATE THE PLANETS\nCONFIGURE YOUR UNITS\nSECRETLY ASSIGN YOUR UNITS TO THE PLANETS WITH THE NAVIGATION CARDS\nONCE EVERYONE HAS ASSIGNED THEIR UNITS, RESOLVE THE PLANETS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE PLAYER ABOVE MIGHT FACE OTHER PLAYERS AT PLANET 1:\nPLAYER 1 HAS 7 SPACE COMBAT (ACE PILOT 3 + FIGHTER 2 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1) WHEREAS PLAYER 2 HAS 8 SPACE COMBAT (FIGHTER 2 + FIGHTER 2 + FIGHTER 2 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1 + SECONDARY LAYOUT FIGHTER 1)\nPLAYER 2 GETS THE FIRST PICK OF PLANETARY LOCATIONS.\nAFTER PLANET 2 HAS BEEN RESOLVED AS WELL, PLAY CONTINUES WITH THE NEXT ROUND AND 2 NEW PLANETS.\nTHE GAME HAS A SET LENGTH OF 7 ROUNDS, AFTER WHICH THE PLAYER WITH THE MOST POINTS WINS THE GAME.\nSean and Ronan from the Gamepit podcast produced one of their Pit Stop videos to concisely explain how Albedo works:  \nToucan Play that Game also produced a How to Play video about Albedo: \nThe expansion consists of a box, a rule book, and 100 cards: the new faction takes up 56 of those cards. There are also 16 planet cards and 20 \"secret\" cards (see explanation below). That leaves 8 cards, which are going to be used for additional copies of the Aerospace Fighter unit from the base game.\nAs a new catch up mechanism, whoever has the least amount of victory points at the end of rounds 2-6 is dealt a secret card. If players are tied for the lowest victory point total, then each of the tieing players receives a secret card. \nThere are 5 different secrets, which are duplicated thrice for a total of 20 cards. Each secret is worth 1 victory point. Instead of taking a victory point a secret can be played for its card effect. Here is a selection of three of the five cards. However, their layout and wording might change slightly. \nPraise for the Albedo base game and the Albedo Space Pirates! expansion: \nFellow game designer Robert Seater, who triggered the idea for the Yggdrasil alien species with his forum question \"Can I play as a fungal or plant-like alien race?\", has this to say about Albedo and its first expansion on BoardGameGeek: \n\nHere is a blurb (click the image to see their review) by Fiona and Amy from the Game Shelf about the Albedo base game: \nThe Cardboard Cultist made a timelapse video about Albedo: \nHerbert and Philipp of the \"Nerds-gegen-Stephan.de... caught in play, der nerdige Trashtalk\" podcast talked about Albedo in one of their earlier episodes (in German). \n Elea and Philipp of the \"Nerdige and niveauvolle Trashtalk\" talked about Albedo in their latest episode, which was recorded on the 6th of July 2019 (in German). You can find the relevant section at the 8 minute 45 seconds mark.\nHolger Christiansen of the Teilzeithelden also reviewed the Albedo base game.

He only had the  first edition available, but apart from cosmetics the first and second  edition are functionally the same: \nLast, but not least, I was a guest on the We're not Wizards podcast and talked about the Albedo Yggdrasil campaign.\n BoardGamePrices.com gave a shout out to Albedo Yggdrasil in their News & Features section!\nIf the base level funding goal is exceeded, additional promo items are added for free as stretch goals to the reward tiers that contain the expansion.\nPromo items may appear at different occasions (for example at a trade show), but Kickstarter backers have early access to these promotional items.\nOnce a stretch goal is reached, the next stretch goal is going to be revealed.\nIf you are a retailer and are interested in Albedo, please get in touch  via e-mail (info at hespiele dot de) to discuss specifics.  \nAs with all Kickstarter campaigns that have physical rewards, one of  the highest costs is shipping, which is about \u20ac9,- for most countries. \nIn  order to reduce the cost for backers, I am going to subsidize the  shipping cost and cover a portion of the shipping cost myself.  Therefore, there is a flat shipping cost fee of \u20ac5,- for everyone instead of different shipping costs for different regions. \nSince the game is produced in Europe, distribution within the European Union is not going to incur additional duties. \nPlease be aware that there might be duties in your country (USA, Canada, Australia, etc.) if you are not residing within the European Union. \nThe EU-friendly shipping image was downloaded (with implicit permission as per their blog post) from Stonemaier Games. \nAlbedo on Boardgamegeek \nHESpiele Website \nImprint \nData Protection / Privacy \nHESpiele on Twitter \nKai Herbertz on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the experience of previous Kickstarter campaigns and two completed board games (\"Das Katastrophenspiel\" and \"Albedo\") I do not expect any unsolvable difficulties.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Our first 2 books touched briefly on the character design process, but this new book is a really deep dive into the art. Character design is such a vast field, which is why it needs it's own focused, indepth book. \nWe're working with an amazing line up of incredible industry PROFESSIONALS, and the book is jam-packed full of their combined experience, gained over their long careers. \nDesign Example - Unofficial Cover\nDesign Example - \"Character Archetypes\" Chapter\n The Goal! \nOur goal is to help YOU be a better artist and have fun at the same time! We want to provide you,  both hobbyists and pros, with a better understanding of the WHOLE character design process. Most importantly, the book gives you the tools you need to produce unique and memorable characters. \nThe techniques and tutorials included in the book help build your confidence and strengthen your knowledge of the art of character design, enabling you to successfully design for any project, and most importantly, in any style. And that's why we have such a wide array of artists with varying styles contributing to book! \nThis is a book that we have dreamed of making for a long time and it is our biggest project to date.

Most evident is our new, easier-to-use format. The original Traveller, many years ago, was three Little Black Books (LBBs) - 48-page black-covered booklets with the titles Characters and Combat, Starships, and Worlds and Adventures. We're formatting this edition as three Big Black Books (BBBs) with the same titles, but 280 pages (Book 1) or more (304 pages for Book 2 and Book 3), and all in a slip case.  \nThe T5 Core Rules Set\nWe have been working on this project constantly since 2015. Oh, there were breaks along the way. After the last printing, I was inspired to write the Traveller novel: Agent of the Imperium; somewhere in there, I had a quadruple bypass (I'm recovered, thank you). But we've been playing Traveller5 and working through its rules and concepts.\nThe Three Core Rules Books\nNow is the time for a reprint. \nAdventuring In The Traveller5 Universe. The Traveller5 Core Rules are a foundation, and  they support all sorts of adventuring within the rich Traveller universe. To help get everyone started, we have created a set of five Traveller EPIC Adventures: \"The Voyages of the Free Trader Insert-Name-Here.\" This 32-page PDF follows the exploits of any Free Trader as it wanders through Regina subsector in the Spinward Marches. We'll release it at the same time the physical books ship (that is, in August). \nAdventuring In Regina Subsector: our introductory EPIC adventures\nCards. If you have ordered anything from us in the past few years, you have probably gotten a few cards stuck in your order. We find these are great pieces to use in adventuring. So we have created the Traveller5 Benefits Deck - 54 Poker Cards in a box (subject to some last minute changes): \n12 ships (Beowulf, Scout, Yacht, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, as encounters, or as goals for adventure.\n12 worlds (Regina, Capital, Rhylanor, and more) for use as homeworlds, interesting places, or as destinations.\n12 weapons (StapleGun, Magnum, Advanced Combat Rifle, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or available in the local weapons shop.\n 6 arcane tasks (Drive Tuning, Knack for Astrogation, and more) for acquisition in the course of adventures.\n 6 medals (Starburst for Extreme Heroism, Exemplary Service, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or as adventure hooks.\n 6 random items for use in adventures. \nJust a sampling; subject to change.\nThe Captain's Supplement (with the Ship captain Level) provides still more items.\nAdd-Ons.We also have three add-ons (they are included at the Owner-Aboard level) that enhance the Traveller system: Deck Plans, the Traveller Novel, and the Traveller Audiobook.\nThe Deck Plans were originally issued with the Big Black Book. This edition describes them in detail based on the Ship Design System, and we find they are a great resource for adventures. \nAdd the Deck Plans to your Pledge for $20.\nThe Traveller Novel - Agent of the Imperiumgives insights into the history of the Imperium. If you missed it, this is your chance to get reading copy, and the Audiobook (on two CDs; about 10 hours of audio). By the way, the Audiobook disks include the novel eBook, AND a footnoted PDF: 300 footnotes explaining and detailing what's going on in the story. \nAdd the Paperback to your pledge for $14.\nAdd the Audiobook to your pledge for $14.\nOr, add both to your pledge for $22.\nAdd Ons\nFinally, each level has one or more Crew ID Cards: Traders' Guild Member Cards with a pre-generated, named character corresponding to the Backer Level (and all the lower level cards as well). At the First Officer (and above) Level, we'll edit the name of the character to a name you specify (within reason).\nAside. This is intended to make you support at a higher level: to bump your pledge up so you'll get more of the cards. But I just can't do it.

Photo by Kyle George.\nA Tribute to the Creative Forces of Trout Grass \nThe film's production lasted nearly three years and spanned two countries, including locations in China, Seattle, Montana, Wyoming, Florida, and Arizona. Andy Royer and Ed George were there, guiding the operations, every dynamic step of the way.\nRecently, these two energetic creators of Trout Grass passed on to the spirit world. Producer, co-writer, and bamboo extraordinaire Andy parted from two daughters and a wife when he died in 2015 after a years-long battle with cancer. Director and cinematographer Ed left unexpectedly in 2016 following a heart attack. Ed\u2019s first gig in filmmaking was as an assistant on the legendary Woodstock documentary, shot 50 years ago this summer!\nTrout Grass is an important part of Ed and Andy's dynamic body of work, and it must continue to be available and discoverable for audiences. Trout Grass: The Revival Edition is a tribute to the two innovators.   \nCinematographer Ed George enjoying a day's work in Montana. Photo from ThisIsBozeman.com\n\"A Beautifully Crafted Film.\" \nTrout Grass: The Revival Edition. A legendary rod maker treks to the source of his inspiration. A craftsman halfway around the planet encounters \"spirits of the bamboo world.\" A writer-angler contemplates the power of our connection to rivers. And diverse audiences discover what it takes to convert a piece of grass into a six-sided baton ready to conduct an orchestra of trout and water. \nThe documentary Trout Grass unveils the joys of international camaraderie, fine craftsmanship, and majestic rivers as it tracks the 10,000-mile passage of bamboo around the world. From a lush forest in remote China, to a rustic workshop in Montana, this film traces the transition of bamboo from a living plant to a finished fly rod. \nTrout Grass has always been an international journey into the passion of fly fishing, but it is also a captivating window into the life force of rivers and the intricate bonds of sustainable craftsmanship.\nThe film appeals not only to fly fishers and bamboo enthusiasts, but also fans with interests in cultural heritage, meaningful work, and the beauty of our Earth's people and places. \nEd George and split-cane aficionado Hoagy B. Carmichael getting the shot. Photo by Kyle George.\nWords and Images Built to Last\nTrout Grass achieved great success upon its release in 2005. The film was featured at a dozen festivals throughout North America and Europe, including the Telluride Mountain Film Festival, and Bend Film in Oregon. The producers were awarded \"Best of Festival\" and \"Audience Choice\" at several screenings. About 5,000 DVDs sold in North America during the first few years of release. The documentary aired on Public Broadcast Service affiliates throughout the western United States. \nBut, hey, as Louis Carlozo of the Chicago Tribune noted, \"If it sounds like the stuff of a public-TV yawner, guess again: [David James] Duncan wastes nary a word as he tackles his subject with a poet's passion and reporter's zeal.\"\nThe film never grows old. Its pace is as soothing as the flow of mountain streams. And like the meticulously crafted split cane fly rods on display in the film, the writing, cinematography, and music are each created by masters of their art. \nReap Your Rewards\u2014Exclusive Posters, DVDs, Downloads, or a Custom Fly Rod\nDepending on your inclinations, the most exciting benefit from your Trout Grass: The Revival Edition pledge might be the custom bamboo fly rod from Sweetgrass Rods of Montana.

Your goal is to develop a self-sustaining colony independent of any terrestrial organization. This will require understanding the importance of water, air, power, and food \u2014 the necessities for survival.\nDo you dare take part in humankind\u2019s biggest challenge?\nRovers, Robots and Ships\nOn Mars is played over several rounds, each consisting of two phases - the Colonization Phase and the Shuttle Phase. \nDuring the Colonization Phase, each player takes a turn during which they take actions. The available actions depend on the side of the board they are on. If you are in orbit, you can take blueprints, buy and develop technologies, and take supplies from the Warehouse. If you are on the surface of the planet, you can construct buildings with your bots, upgrade these buildings using blueprints, take scientists and new contracts, welcome new ships, and explore the planet\u2019s surface with their rover.  \nIn the Shuttle Phase, players may travel between the colony and the Space Station in orbit. \nAll buildings on Mars have a dependency on each other and some are required for the colony to grow. Building shelters for Colonists to live in requires oxygen; generating oxygen requires plants; growing plants requires water; extracting water from ice requires power; generating power requires mining minerals; and mining minerals requires Colonists.  \nUpgrading the colony\u2019s ability to provide each of these resources is vital. As the colony grows, more shelters are needed so that the Colonists can survive the inhospitable conditions on Mars. \nDuring the game, players are also trying to complete missions. Once a total of three missions have been completed, the game ends. \nTo win the game, players must contribute to the development of the first colony on Mars. This is represented during the game by players gaining Opportunity Points (OP). The player with the most OP at the end of the game is declared the winner. \nNOTE: Contents shown on this page are for visual representation only.

We established our makeshift colony on Charon and explored the region. We discovered the Royal Martian Federation (RMF), the Hielo and the Myst, and made contact. Although historical rivals, we worked together to survive the frigid conditions, stockpiling resources and launching probes across the Milky Way.\nOne probe returned compelling data from the Copernicus System in Quadrant 1. Coper has a yellow dwarf star and an intriguing group of planets. A dazzling radioactive element, that we named Vertium, was discovered. Our physicists think it could heat our colonies, and upgrade weapons and armour. As word spread, the rebel groups bolted for Coper. The fragile cooperation evaporated. Each faction is now out for itself - claiming planets and mining Vertium. The stakes are clear: for whoever controls the Vertium will control Coper, and perhaps the galaxy. Brooks out.\nVertium is a quick and tactical space colonization game for 1 to 4 players. Players are faction Commanders directing their Captains to claim planets and mine the powerful radioactive element Vertium.\nAs influential moons orbit the colonized planets, additional Vertium is gained.

Numbering now in the trillions, they are a polyglot, cosmopolitan people, organized under a central hegemon: Union. The galaxy is vast before them, and humanity is its mirror. For some, it is a golden age of post-scarcity utopia. For the rest, that golden age remains a dream to be attained. \nInto this roiling galaxy you take your role as a mech pilot \u2014  from cold-blooded mercenaries to honor-bound Baronic cuirassiers, hardscrabble Union regulars to professional Constellar Midnights, Far Field teams at the uncanny edge of known space to the ever-wandering Albatross. Operating with a wealth of licenses from one of the galaxy\u2019s Big Five fabricators, you and your friends play a tight-knit squad of pilots on campaign \u2014 comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Will you fight for Union, working to rectify the crimes of previous administrations? Will you run contracts for a corpro-state, working to advance private interests while lining your pockets? Will you fight to liberate your people from all masters, human or otherwise? Or will you fight only for yourself? \nLancer features a mix of military science fiction and mythic science fantasy. In the setting, conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpostate agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking entities. \nIn Lancer, there is promise in the potential, but the hard-won gains of humanity are under serious threat. From the internal: ruthless corpro-states, bitter anthrochauvinist reactionaries, and ponderous oligarchs, to the external: MONIST 1, or RA, an anoriginary being with unfathomable power and unknowable goals; the Aunic Ascendancy, the unbroken heirs of Old Humanity; and more. \nHaving only begun the project of recovering from its own internal political revolutions, Union now scrambles to reassert its control over a galaxy that would fall to chaos otherwise.\nWho will you fight for, pilot? \nLancers relaxing between deployment\nWhat is Lancer?\nLancer is a tabletop roleplaying game that prioritizes four pillars of play: \nRules-light, fluid, narrative play while outside of the mech.  \nTactical mech combat that promotes creative tactics, teamwork and explosive moments of action.\nModular, progression-based mech customization where narrative, setting, and character is imbued in the gear, systems, and equipment your character chooses. \nA play loop that encourages narrative advancement. \nLancer offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It\u2019s best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign. \nLancer draws thematic inspiration from various media: The lived-in, cosmopolitan, working class CRT retrofuture of Aliens, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Akira, and Cowboy Bebop; the science fantasy of Dan Simmons\u2019 Hyperion Cantos, Bungie\u2019s Destiny, Ursula LeGuin\u2019s The Left Hand of Darkness, Moebius\u2019s The World of Edena and Arzach, and Anne Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy; the soldiers-on-campaign tension of The Thin Red Line, Band of Brothers, and Platoon; and the subjectivity-fraying uncanny of Tarkovsky's Stalker, Cronenberg\u2019s Videodrome, and Evangelion\u2019s Angels. \nMechanically, aspects of Lancer\u2019s play owe particular thanks to existing media for inspiration: Schwalb Entertainment\u2019s Shadow of The Demon Lord for its Accuracy/Difficulty system; the Armored Core series for its modular mech customization; and to John Harper\u2019s Blades In The Dark for its downtime systems.  \nWhile we have a significant number of finished art and lore in the book already, we imagine the final product to be part setting book, part ruleset, and part art book \u2014 a rich resource for not only roleplaying tools, but narrative-inspiring art and worldbuilding. \nBruja introducing her Gorgon\nWhat Does Lancer Do Differently?\nThere are clear, differentiated rules for narrative play and tactical combat.\nNarrative play and tactical combat demand different rule sets and scales of play. Whether you want the game to move at a fluid, narrative pace in order to zoom in or expand your story, or jump right into tactical mech combat, Lancer establishes clear guidelines for when and how to implement differing styles. \nLancer offers systemized downtime and brings narrative-enhancing structure to the play session.\nLancer has a clear play structure making it easy for game masters of any experience to run a dynamic campaign. Players can take downtime actions with defined outcomes to progress story beats, work on projects, or get access to resources. What they do during downtime impacts how their missions begin, progress, and end. This structure prompts clear goals, stakes, and personal involvement from the characters that will help your table to bring storytelling, role-playing, and consequence to every game.\nLancer\u2019s character system is classless, modular, and encourages deep customization.\nWhen you progress in Lancer, your pilot permanently gains licenses that grant them access to parts and gear from a mech of their choice. Unlike other games, however, you are not locked in to a set character path - instead you will create your own personalized mech. Your pilot can mix and match any parts you like, creating a system where players define their own roles by the choices they make. Build broad or deep \u2014 your pilot is your pilot, and your mech is your mech. \nFlavor, characterization, and setting drive every aspect of Lancer \nNearly every gear option has lore attached to it, further defining the history and tone of the setting as well as acting as hooks for deeper player characterization. When you take licenses from the IPS-Northstar Raleigh, the gunslinging mech with the MJOLNIR chest cannon, you know exactly what you're getting.\nOda and his IP-N Raleigh, deep desert\nYou can already play the pre-release version of LANCER here (the link or clicking on the title above will take you to our itch.io page where you can download the game) and download a fully working version of our companion app, COMP/CON, here. This is the full game, totally free and currently being played by dozens of groups, but without a lot of the art, layout, and editing that's the goal of this kickstarter. Even after release, we will always have a free version of LANCER available on all platforms.\nAfter nearly two years of development, play testing, and community building, we wanted to take the next step and finish Lancer\u2019s first edition core book in proper form: hardback, with full color, professional editing and layout, and packed with art by some of the best illustrators working in comics and concept design today. \nClick through for a larger size\nLancer is a large project. Roughly 560 pages of finished text \u2014 rules, setting information, lore, generators, NPCs, and many more tools for Game Masters \u2014 almost 20 artists, and millions of possible gear combinations. We\u2019re asking for a fair amount to fund this project, but we think it\u2019s just that \u2014  a fair ask. \nClick through for a closer look at the MkII Sherman\nOne of the things we want to make clear is that we don\u2019t want to keep anyone from playing Lancer. Despite the campaign to raise funds necessary to create a final product, we mean to keep a version of Lancer free \u2014 always. We've gone almost two years in public development of this game and intend to keep the game available for the community to play and enjoy.\nLancer is the second TTRPG from Tom Parkinson Morgan, creator of Kill Six Billion Demons and Broken Worlds, and Miguel Lopez, a fiction writer based out of Portland, Oregon.\nMassif Press is a new publisher made up of Tom Parkinson Morgan and Miguel Lopez.

Here's the breakdown:\n 300 Backers: Iconic Mech Wallpapers (for desktop and phone) - ACHIEVED! \n 400 Backers: Logo Wallpapers (for desktop and phone) - ACHIEVED! \n 500 Backers: Company Catalog Wallpapers  - ACHIEVED! \n 1000+ Backers: Access to CLOCKMAKER'S BARDO, a sealed Union Intelligence Bureau report. -  ACHIEVED! \n CLOCKMAKER'S BARDO Report unlocked.

Expect a Twine game to be delivered no later than the physical copy's launch date. \nClick through for the social stretch goals\nAs we gain in backers, we will release the art and details for the four Long Rim mechs above, so stay posted!\nWe amazingly blew through our first stretch goals in the first 6 hours of this campaign. This means all backers at the PDF tier and up will receive digital copies of No Room for a Wallflower, Lancer's first official campaign module, and three Field Guides, setting and lore guides for the various areas of the Lancer canon. Delivery for these digital-only rewards will be some time in 2020.\nSince we're predicting our physical book will be ready to ship no later than March 2020, and shipping quotes are only good for a brief window (comparatively speaking) we're going to hold off on charging shipping fees right away; we don't want to under charge now and then have to charge you again when it comes time to fulfill your pledges!\nAs soon as we're ready to ship, we'll send out a notice via BackerKit \u2014 that way we can ensure you'll have the best possible price on shipping. So, for right now, you don't have to add anything to your pledge beyond the stated pledge level! \nIn the meantime, here's an idea of what we're projecting for shipping costs (subject to change, of course, all prices in USD):\nDomestic shipping (US) will run a flat $12.00.\nCanada, UK, EU, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Japan is a flat $25.00 USD.\nShipping to New Zealand is $27.00 USD\nShipping to Switzerland and Norway is $45.00 USD. \nAnd shipping to the rest of the world is $51.00 USD.\nNote that these are all subject to change. If you're snagging a physical book, be on the lookout for further communications via BackerKit. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know backing TTRPG campaigns from new developers can be a risk, but we want to assure you that Lancer is a safe bet. While this is Massif Press' first campaign, we are confident in our timeline and our product. \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe text for the Core Book is done save for a final copyedit and layout, has been available in progressive editions for free since July 2017, and has a robust play and homebrew community. If you're new to Lancer or on the fence about backing, you can check out the full game for free, request a PDF of an older edition, or come chat with the dev team and homebrew/fan community on the Discord. We're passionate about this project, and intend to use the funds raised by this campaign to pay our layout artist, editor, and general artists to polish this book with the finish we feel it -- and its fans -- deserve. \n\nSo, to that end, here are the risks we face: \n\nDeadlines. As soon as the campaign wraps and we can pay our team, they'll get working on art, editing, and layout. As long as they stick on deadline, we'll meet our final PDF fulfillment date. We don't anticipate any delays as long as we are able to get deliveries from our art team on time.\n\nPrinting. Once our final PDF is sorted out, we'll be working with our printer to get the first run of books on time. As soon as the final product is proofed and the first run is printed, we'll get physical copies sent to the backers that pledged for them. Time and shipping are the risks here -- we'll be communicative and up front with all backers who come in at this level, and expect physical fulfillment no later than March 2020. In the meantime, you'll always have access to the free PDF, and the Premium PDF as soon as it's finished.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Ominet Access", "descp": ">//ACCESS is TRUE and PERSISTENT\nWant to follow along with development?

We will be trawling through the Journals of yesteryear, selecting the best articles, revising/re-writing them for the latest edition of the game, and adding a whole host of never-before-seen material. This will (initially) be compiled into three volumes which, for Kickstarter backers only, will arrive within their own deluxe slipcase.\nWe will also be drawing from the better fanzines of the era (having tracked down the original authors) to create the essential resource for exploring Charted Space!\nThe Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society (JTAS) will be starting at three 128 page volumes, but stretch goals will unlock additional volumes at no extra cost to backers - we will simply extend the slipcase in size and add the additional books!\n\nWhat is Inside?\nMuch of the work on the first three volumes has already been completed, and you can download part of Volume One right HERE, so you can see the style we are going for with these books. This is a work in progress, and you will see it updated to completion over the course of the Kickstarter project.\nEach is a treasure trove of information and game additions, including adventures, new ships, animals from across Charted Space, philosophical musings on the big empires, histories, different takes on familiar equipment and vehicles, brand new vehicles, characters to be met in starports, playable alien races, and much, much more...\nThis is what we currently have planned for Volume One (subject to tweaks and ever better ideas as we continue to work on the Journals):\n The Ship in the Lake: Uncover a sunken vessel lying in a potential hotspot to uncover a small fortune\n Bestiary: Poke and provoke the Bush Runner, Tree Kraken, Lozin, Luugiir, Tree Lion, Seedspitter and Miniphant\n SOHO Light Freighter: A heavily armed trader suitable for the worst areas of the Reach - with High Guard rules for Laser Barbettes\n SuSAG: The run down on one of the largest megacorporations in Charted Space\n The ATV: A look at the familiar ATV, with variants both large and small, grav-assisted and aquatic\n A Concise History of the Vilani: Explore how the Vilani rose to prominence\n Burst Lasers: For when you just cannot decide between pulse and beam\n The Dynchia & Girug'kagh: Two fully playable minor alien races\n Remote Piloted Reconnaissance Unit: A perfect device for Travellers who want to see what they will be facing before leaping in with both feet\n Embassy in Arms: Stage an evacuation of an embassy under fire in this adventure\n Within the Two Thousand Worlds: Understand the K'kree before they appear in your campaigns later this year\n Piracy on the Spinward Main: How best to make Credits from 'freelance' trade?\n Vargr Corsairs: And then see how the masters do it\n Assault Rocket Launcher: A brand new weapon with ammunition to resolve any situation\n Simone Garibaldi: A scholar to be met at any starport - but is her latest discovery real?\n Emperors of the Third Imperium: Just who is in charge, and how did they get there?\n Light Patrol Vehicle & APC: Found at many starports, these light vehicles are suitable for policing and light military use alike\nVolumes Two and Three have oodles more articles, including more aliens and animals, more adventures and characters, explorations of Imperial and Zhodani military forces, a revision of the original Exotic Atmospheres Special Supplement, vehicles of the IISS, and much, much more - we will be showcasing the contents of each volume during the Kickstarter process and courting your opinion on the articles!\nThe new Journals of the Travellers' Aid Society come in a 8.5\" x 5.5\" format (a bit bigger than the old 'little black books'), making them easy to have at hand at the gaming table to flip to the articles you are after.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWell, we enjoy talking about Traveller to Traveller fans which, for us, is enough to get everyone involved in the first place.\nHowever, the greater truth is that we are sitting on tons and tons of Traveller source material... and these Journals are the perfect vehicle to get it to you. \nDoing this project via Kickstarter will not only allow us to gauge your opinions and reactions as to the actual contents of the Journals and which articles should be selected for inclusion, but we can link your backing directly to the amount of content - in effect, the more popular this project becomes, the more volumes we will be able to put into the slipcase.\nWe will be starting with three volumes and have already started compiling articles for a fourth. How many more will follow will be up to all of you!\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you the most and we will soon have the Journals in your hands.\nA huge (28\"x 40\") full colour poster map showcasing the major powers of Charted Space and their position in the galaxy\nSix Traveller pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Traveller pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Ship Recognition Pack, 25 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most common ships of Charted Space\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Traveller dice\nA Character Sheet pad, ready for your Travellers to record their most personal details...\n\nStretch Goals\nThere is a Tigress Dreadnought's worth of Traveller material we could fill many JTAS volumes with - and that is exactly what we will be doing through stretch goals!\nIf we reach these intergalactic heights, we will add to the TAS Welcome Pack - High Passage backers will gain a paperback 'novel' containing a set of Traveller short stories. These will also be received as ebooks (PDF, ebook, and mobi formats), and High Passage backers will be the very first to read the first instalments of a new range of Traveller fiction coming later this year...\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill in the gaps of their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for the Journals to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have always delivered on our Kickstarter projects and if you were to ask one of our previous backers of previous Traveller projects such as The Great Rift or the Element Class Cruiser Blueprints, we believe you would hear that the quality of our Kickstarter projects is always worth it, and you tend to end up with more than you originally pledged for!\n\nThat said, we have taken steps to ensure the Journal of the Travellers Aid Society does not over run its projected completion date.\n\nFor a start, much of the work has already been done on the first three volumes, and volume one has already entered the art and layout process - you can freely download what has been completed for free using the link above.\n\nSecond, we have brought in several Traveller-writers, including fan favourite Martin J Dougherty, to pen the brand new material for these Journals, thus spreading the load. Traveller veterans will know the reputation of Mr Dougherty well, as he is a true professional and one of the most reliable writers Mongoose has ever worked with in our near-18 years of business - backers of the Great Rift and Element Cruisers Kickstarter projects saw that he delivered manuscripts on time, and they were most excellent!\n\nWe will be showcasing previews of the Journals throughout this Kickstarter to demonstrate just what we are working on, how we are progressing, and to gauge your opinion on the articles.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Traveller", "descp": "You get the heartfelt thanks of the Travellers Aid Society, and a warm welcome in every starport you visit!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Virtual TAS Member", "descp": "You will receive the PDF edition of The Journal of the Travellers Aid Society, with all volumes and all stretch goals that are unlocked in PDF format!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["146 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "TAS Member", "descp": "You will receive the slipcase edition of The Journal of the Travellers Aid Society, with all volumes and all stretch goals that are unlocked, along with the PDF editions as soon as they are complete.

Click here for information \nHow does a book of war game rules written in 1880 lead directly to the creation of Dungeons & Dragons nearly a hundred years later?\nSecrets of Blackmoor is the two-hour documentary film resulting from an unprecedented exploration into the evolution of Role Playing Games (RPG's) that reveals the true origin of Dungeons & Dragons.\nIt's the story of the invention of Role Playing Games as told by the people who were there: the Twin Cities Gamers. \nIf you think D&D is the beginning of the story, then think again: D&D is actually the end of the beginning.\nA pair of extremely valuable copies of Original Dungeons & Dragons (commonly known as OD&D)\nIn 1974, Dungeons & Dragons is the first Role Playing Game ever published.  It also becomes a worldwide phenomenon that brings fame and fortune to its creators: Gary Gygax and David L. Arneson.\nPlayed by millions, and now a multi-billion dollar industry, D&D has influenced the likes of Stephen Colbert, George RR Martin, Robin Williams, and countless others.\nIt is the foundation of much of today's pop culture: Game of Thrones, World of Warcraft, Magic the Gathering, and more.\nYet, Dave and Gary's fame, and the ensuing legends & myths, have eclipsed the actual history of the game.\nIs this the oldest Character Sheet ever found? It is!\nSecrets of Blackmoor takes you to the very beginning, and reveals what actually led to D&D.  The film debunks the tired old mythology by showing you the very roots of the RPG's creation and all the relevant facts:  the who, how, and why of the game's origin.\nBe one of the first to know the Secrets of Blackmoor -- Coming March, 2019.\nA Napoleonic miniatures battle being played, 1966. Is this the beginning of Role Playing? It is!\nWe are done editing the movie, but it needs a little more work before it can be released.  All of our time is now consumed by what can best be described as adding a fine finish to an already wonderful movie.  We're really down to adding the last touches -- things like color and sound refinements. \nWe feel strongly that Secrets of Blackmoor is the seminal documentary on the history of Dungeons & Dragons. Yet we need you to support us in this last stage of post production.\nPlease take a minute to look over our videos, and gifts (located in the side bar).  There's even a special reward level to be delivered this Christmas day.\nGet out your dice and roll for initiative, become part of our Secret Team by pledging your support!\nMore about the film follows.\nIn 1963, a bunch of high schoolers and college students form a military history club in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.\nHiding within this club is a group of war gamers, who find an old military training manual from the 1880's in the library of the University of Minnesota. On the cover is  a curious title,   Strategos - the American Game of War, and it is written by a man with an equally curious name, Charles Adiel Lewis Totten. \nIs this the book that inspires the Twin Cities gamers to invent the RPG? It is!\nWithin the dense pages of this old book are a few sentences that inspire these young gamers.  The influence of Strategos quickly changes how they play their war games.  But are they really following these old rules, or have they stumbled onto something truly unique by re-interpreting what they say?\nShould a game be constrained by rules and a board, like Monopoly, or should there be no boundaries at all? \nIs this one of the oldest Dungeons in existence? It is!\nThese young gamers have no idea that they will devote the next 10 years of their lives as the incubator that develops the ideas and methods for an entirely new type of game, and that they will change the face of their hobby forever.\nOne thing is very clear--something magical is going on in the Twin Cities.\nMost people no longer know the names of the gamers who came before D&D, or the crazy ideas they came up with that made D&D possible.  Without people's names to attach to ideas, the real history of how RPG's come into existence gets lost. \nWho is David Wesely?\nWho is Duane Jenkins?\nWho is Peter Gaylord?\nWho is Ross Maker?\nWho is Helen Nicholson?\nDave Arneson's own miniatures on his map of the Comeback Inn\nAs you dig deeper into the past, you begin to ask even more questions.  Who created the archetype of the first Wizard, Thief, or Paladin in one of these games?  Who was the First Woman to ever play in an RPG?  Where did the concept of the dungeon adventure come from?  Who was the first \u201cDungeon Master,\u201d or referee?\nAnd the number one question: who invented Role Playing?\nWe've been asking ourselves these kinds of questions since we began playing RPG's back in the 70's.\nThose who helped create RPG's are nearly forgotten.  Many of them have passed away unsung.  Yet clues to their lives can be found in cardboard boxes hidden in attics and basements.   Old papers, and worn lead ships and soldiers, tell stories of hard fought battles and dirty political maneuvering.\nIs this a secret message passed between players during the very first RPG in 1968? ... It is!\nMost important is the revelation of the ideas behind all of the games they create.  That with each iteration of their games and ideas, these young gamers in the Twin Cities are pushing the envelope on how a game should be played.  That there isn't just one RPG, or one inventor, but many. \nThey begin to develop a new play style, The Role Play Method, and they apply this method to nearly every game they get their hands on, thus creating a series of RPG's.\nThe evidence for these games can be found in the relics.  We have worked to discover and preserve many astounding game documents, like the first character sheet, or hand-written correspondence in a game between mighty rulers in the time of Napoleon.  There are even maps of worlds, cities, and foreboding dungeons.\nIs this the earliest town map made for an RPG? It is!\nOften the meaning of the relics isn't obvious, but video interviews with the people who used these objects gives them context.   We have sought to record as many interviews as possible, thus preserving what is left of the oral history of the Original Role Playing Gamers, \"The Blackmoor Bunch\".\nThe old stories and secrets have been closely held by the people who were there when it all began over 50 years ago, and are now finally revealed in the documentary Secrets of Blackmoor: The True History of Dungeons & Dragons.\nIt might be surprising to find out that this documentary began as an accident.  We really never thought we'd be doing this kind of film and we had no idea what we'd discover.  Yet, it has exploded into an obsession for us. \nJust over 5 years ago, myself, M. Griffith (call me Griff), and my partner Chris Graves, known collectively as \u201cThe Fellowship of the Thing,\u201d set out on an investigation into the history of role playing.  We did it by asking simple questions like: Who was the first player to die in a role playing game?\nOur search became worldwide as we reached out to experts all over the planet for help.  We ended up traveling to 10 different cites in search of answers.  We shot over 200 hours of movie footage and we found more than 20,000 documents and photographs.  It is difficult to show you just how enormous this project has become.\nIs this the first Dragon figure made for an RPG? It is!\nThis entire adventure has been a gamble for us.  Our first exploratory shooting trip could have been a complete failure.  We might have realized that there was nothing new to be found, and that making a movie about RPG's is just a silly idea, yet we\u2019d just spent about $10,000 on a crap shoot.\nInstead, we discovered that there was a group of incredibly fascinating people with interesting stories to tell.  There were many games developed by the Twin Cities gamers that have role playing in them, and that, to paraphrase what they tell us: the invention of RPG's did not happen overnight; it was an accumulation of ideas that evolved over many years. \nIs this the first indication that a Fantasy RPG is happening in the twin cities? It is!\nThe sheer volume of people, life events, and games, cannot be covered in just one documentary.  It forces us to make a lot of hard decisions about what to cut and what to keep in this first in a series of films.\nThis is only Volume 1. We narrowed down the subject matter to fit into one 2-hour movie. This first movie examines where the very concept of the RPG came from, and how it led to Dungeons & Dragons.  Yet there are many other stories we found:  the genius behind the Dungeon! board game, John Snider's 1972 Sci-Fi Role Playing Game,  M.A.R. Barker's World of Tekumel, and others.  We look forward to following up on this film with another volume with more detail about Gary and Dave collaborating on the creation of Dungeons & Dragons. \nFor now, we want to focus on getting this movie done.\nThank you, \nChris and Griff (Co-Directors of SECRETS of BLACKMOOR)\nThis year is a significant landmark in RPG history.  It was during Christmas break, 50 years ago, that David Wesely tested a game he invented. It was set in a town named Braunstein. With that one game, David Wesely took the methods for roleplaying to new heights, and the Twin Cites gamers liked it so much that the term \"Braunstein\" became their term for all their RPG's.\nWe want to celebrate this occasion.  We also want people to know about Wesely's game. Anyone who supports us at Any Level will receive a special online screener of the 24 minute section of the film dedicated to Braunstein, available on Christmas Day, 2018.\nWatch this screener, and you will know the answer to \"who was the first player to die in an RPG?\". \nWe've also come up with several other \"Thank You\" gifts at a variety of levels that are located in the sidebar of this web page.\nVideo on Demand, DVD's, T-shirts, Dice Bags, and more...\n We have online screeners and DVD's of the movie.  We have a T-shirt designed by Bob Bledsaw (in 8 different colors and 7 sizes from XS to 3XL). The image shows Gerti the Dragon taking flight over Blackmoor Castle.  (\"Gerti\" is the name of the very first Dragon in fantasy RPG's).  There are handmade Dice Bags with the Blackmoor castle emblem also designed by Bob.  We know you won't want to miss out on those.\nWe also really want to highlight the truly special gifts!\nThe Braunstein Gift Pack:\nWe did say \"be one of the first to know the Secrets of Blackmoor,\" and we know some of you just can't wait to see the film.  We've created a gift level for those who want an insider sneak peek of the entire film - available on Christmas Day, 2018.  Sure, it won't be all slick and perfect like the final version, but if you want to see the film early, well, you'll have to put up with seeing a little bit less shine (you'll still get the final, polished version in February).\nWe think this is an ideal gift for the gamer in your family (whether it's you, or someone you know, who will truly enjoy being one of the first to see the movie). \n The Lost Dungeon of Tonisborg Deluxe Hard Bound Edition Book: \nOld School Fantasy Artwork from Tonisborg Dungeon Deluxe Edition Book\nA complete 10 level mega-dungeon module in a hard bound cover!\nWhile making the movie we discovered the never published Tonisborg Dungeon maps, the second fantasy RPG dungeon from the Twin Cities, that all thought had been long lost (it had been hidden away in a basement for decades).  We asked the original creator, Greg Svenson, how he felt about making a book with his dungeon maps in it, and he really liked the idea.  Then we got Daniel Boggs, game historian and designer, to contribute his design expertise along with his Champions of Zed, Open Game License, rules.  Lastly, we got ahold of Bob Bledsaw Jr. (Judges Guild), who had worked with his father on Dave Arneson's First Fantasy Campaign in 1977, and he came on board as well.\nOver the past year we've been putting together this historic Game Module, with personal background by Greg Svenson, maps, guidelines for old school play, and complete game rules.\nIt even includes many quotes like this one, by the original RPG'ers:\n\"Anxiety leads to doubt - doubt leads to fear - and fear, if properly manipulated - leads to terror!\" - Robert Kuntz - Game Author and Theoretician\nIt is written so that a novice can learn to play, yet we've put some old gamer wisdom into the book that even experienced grognards will appreciate.\nThe Minnesota Gaming Experience:\n(Limit 6 to 10 gifts)\nThe Minnesota Gamers playing one of the games that, through their desire to improve playability and have more fun, led to the invention of RPG's\nThis is something truly unique. When we told David Megarry, author of the Dungeon! (1975) board game, and member of the group who invented RPG's, about our upcoming Kickstarter, he asked if he could help us.\nWe weren't really sure what he was planning.  Several days later he phoned us and proposed that he would host a mini game convention in the Twin Cities.\nThe Minnesota Gaming Experience was born! \nRoss Maker (left) and Bob Meyer (Right) at the Dave Arneson memorial Blackmoor game session, 2018\nSome of our intrepid supporters will be able to come and play many of the games that influenced the creation of RPG's with the very people who created the games.  It's like a cruise ship vacation to Gamer Fantasy Island. \nWe like the idea so much, that both Chris and I will be coming to the event.  I'm even going to run a game session for those brave enough to risk entering Tonisborg Dungeon.\nJust to sum it all up:  It's a week of gaming at a bed and breakfast.  All your meals are taken care of.  You play a different game every day.  All you have to do is get yourself to the Twin Cities.\nEvent begins March 28th and ends April 3rd, 2019 (Check the sidebar for a list of games, and referees.)\nThere are some stipulations:\n-We have to get at least 6 people to support us at this level, or we will have to refund the donations.\n-We do not provide transportation to Minnesota, but we will have airport pick-ups and drop- offs.\nPersonally Delivered Dungeon! Board Game:\n(Limit 1 gift at this level)\nDavid Megarry with his original Dungeon! game map prototype\nThis Gift Level is another of David Megarry's brainstorms.  What can we say?  He really likes the movie. \nIt is the most elite of gifts: an original, unopened 1st edition copy of Dungeon! - the adventure board game from 1975.\nWell, ok. That's sorta cool--but it gets better! \nDavid Megarry will hand deliver the game to your house anywhere in the USA or Canada.  He will also give a personal presentation to you & your friends on the history of the Twin Cities Gamers, and how he came up with the idea for his game.  After that, he will show you how Dungeon! is played and help you have a fun gaming session with several, already opened copies. (The true importance of Dungeon! is revealed in Secrets of Blackmoor).  \nWho knows, maybe the Secret Team will tag along and shoot some video of the event.  \nMore information about all of the gifts are in the sidebar. \nIs this a photo of members of the Blackmoor Bunch in Dave Arneson's Living Room, 1971?

Are they \"successful\" in life? Can they get into college if they choose to follow that route? How do they make a living, get jobs or start their own businesses? And how do they define success for themselves?\nSELF-TAUGHT is a documentary that answers these questions, as told through the stories of six remarkable young adults who share their personal challenges and successes of growing up unschooled. As they talk about their childhoods and their desire to learn in their own unique ways, they also reflect upon how these experiences helped shaped who they have become as adults. \nIn addition to these main stories we\u2019ll also hear from experts with extensive experience in alternative education models, child development and psychology, and and delve into what it means to be a self-directed learner. Plus we'll spend time at a center that has been changing the lives of teen learners for more than two decades.\nThere is a growing interest worldwide in alternative ways of learning and families everywhere are seeking answers and new learning opportunities that will empower their children. I believe these stories will resonate strongly with those already on the path of self-directed learning and inspire and encourage those who are considering taking their education into their own hands.\nHOW WILL THE MONEY BE USED?\nI mentioned briefly in the video above what stages the film has to go through next in order to be completely finished. Here's a specific breakdown of exactly what those stages are and how the money raised in this campaign will be used:\n\nMUSIC  - The music for any film makes a huge difference to the final experience. It truly transforms it and I'd like to have compelling music in this film too. This part of the finishing process is by far the biggest and most expensive task. A great composer is worth their weight in gold.\nCOLOR-CORRECTION - For the most part, the footage in the film looks fantastic. But there are always shots that need some extra help and additionally, a skilled colorist can give the whole film a unified look that makes it flow seamlessly from shot to shot so that your viewing experience is not interrupted by distracting visuals. \nSOUND MIXING - There's nothing worse than not being able to hear the sound of a film properly, or having the music and dialogue competing with each other for aural space. All the sound in a film has to be balanced and mixed so that you can hear everything well and get the full audio experience.\n   HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS \nKickstarter is all-or-nothing funding so if I don't make it to $15,000 no one will receive the awesome rewards, I'll get absolutely nothing and the film won't get finished. That would be a sad scenario. I understand that not everyone will be able to make a financial contribution at this time, but please know that every dollar counts towards reaching the goal, and every effort you make to promote the project will help me reach more potential backers. So regardless of whether you can personally donate, please promote this project on Facebook, twitter and on your other social media platforms. I'm grateful for your support.\nCAN WE EXCEED OUR KICKSTARTER GOAL? \nAbsolutely! If we raise more than the $15,000 goal, I'll be able to take the film that much further along in the process. I can use the extra funds to promote the film more widely, organize screenings and perhaps even make personal appearances at screening events. So if you are passionate about the idea of freedom in education, if you were inspired by my last film Class Dismissed, then please consider donating whatever you can to this project. Every donation counts and I really want to share this film with you.\nThank you so much for your support, Jeremy Stuart, Director", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges involved in making an independent film with a low budget, delays can happen for all kinds of reasons, but with a solid track record making my last film Class Dismissed and with over 25 years experience in the film industry as a veteran editor, I feel very confident that I can deliver a fantastic film for you.

Read on...\nIn The Crusoe Crew, you'll work together with the other players to explore islands, solve puzzles, and find rubies, pearls, and statuettes that will allow you to buy items for the next session!\nYou are going to really love this experience! Here are some key features of the game.\n Contents include: 4 - 96 page soft cover books, 1 map/rulesheet, Box with magnet enclosure and ribbon for easy removal of the books from the box. Deluxe pledge also includes a special box with deluxe ruby, pearl, and statuette game pieces!\n Family friendly gameplay for 1-4 players ages 7 and up (or even younger with adult help!). Also highly enjoyable for grown \"kids at heart\" like most of us gamers are!\n Virtually no setup time and minimal rules! Start playing in as little as 5 minutes.\n Great character choices! Play as one of the (fictional) children of the famed Robinson Crusoe, each with their own book and a different talent that will make you personal experience differ from that of the other players.\n Explore multiple islands several times and with different characters giving you hours of replayability.\n A multi-player gamebook experience... if you always wished you could share your game book experiences with your friends than you are going to absolutely love this game. I'm in heaven playing our new Graphic Novel Adventures books and this game takes it to a whole new level.\nLet's take a deeper look into the game and how it works...\nYour father, the famed Robinson Crusoe, has fallen ill. \nWhen his pirate friend, the infamous Raloo Pali, shows up to recruit Robinson for his treasure hunting skills, he has no other choice but to rely on the Crusoe kids to do the job. \nYou'll each choose one of the four Crusoe kids (it is ok if you have fewer players and only choose some!). \nKik - (pronounced like \"Kick\")  has exceptional strength, not to mention a hammer and explosives for uhh... select circumstances.\n Sarah - she can talk to animals and her cat Purr sometimes sniffs out secrets.\nGabby - she is the queen of riddles and can solve puzzles easier than her siblings.\nNeta - he is incredibly agile and can reach otherwise difficult or impossible to reach spaces.\n Next, you'll decide which of the 3 treasure types you want to prioritize as a team, rubies (easiest), pearls (average), or statuettes (difficult). You'll still search for ALL treasure types, but they will be converted at the end of the game for scoring purposes.  \nNow you are ready to play! Select an island on the map to explore and each player will turn to that frame in their respective book!\nPlayers will need to be on the lookout for hidden treasures, hidden numbers, and ways to use their unique character talents. The following is an example of how the game plays with multiple characters. Click on the image if you'd like to see a higher resolution version of it! \nClick the image to see a higher resolution version of it!\nTrack what you find and how much time has passed on the rule sheet (printable version will be available for download). You'll have only 5 days* to find the most treasure possible, so good luck!\n*within the game, a day ends when you see the sun symbol as on the character sheet below \nFor a more fun way to track your treasure, back for the Deluxe version and get a piece pack that includes plastic Rubies, Pearls, and little Statuette miniatures! \n*Components and sizes not final and subject to change.\nEach time your group finds a treasure during the game, you'll take one of those pieces and put it in the treasure box. At the end of the game during scoring, you'll simply count how many of each piece you have!\nThe Crusoe Crew has multiple islands to explore. Some frames will have you mark 1 day off on your sheet when you see a sun icon. When 5 days have passed, the game is over. You can get a lot of play from each of the main islands exploring each multiple times and you will also want to experience them with each of the different characters. All of these factors add up to many hours of enjoyment for you, your family, your friends, and your game group!  \n\"Crusoe Crew is the type of game that can create a memorable experiences for your friends and family.  As a solo player, I wanted to squeeze all the fun out of all four books. There is enough content to keep you busy for awhile. \" - Jeremy, Jambalaya Plays Games\nWe want to make this as simple as possible, so there are just three options for pledging.\nAdditional copies of any pledge can be added by multiplying the pledge amount by the number of that pledge you would like to receive, no additional shipping is required.\nDue to our localization agreement we can only offer rewards for shipping to the USA, Canada, and Australia. We apologize for any inconvenience or disappointment this may cause to our customers in other regions. Please be on the lookout for other language versions of the game in your region. \n ****Advanced Shipping option for USA and Canada****\nWe are offering a limited number of pledges to receive The Crusoe Crew early. We can do this by air shipping a pallet of games over from China. Backers choosing advanced shipping will receive the game 4 - 8 weeks early! \nThe Crusoe Crew is a fully developed Graphic Novel Adventures cooperative game contained within four books and is our English translation of the game recently released in France from publishers Makaka Editions and Blue Orange Europe. We are producing the English version under a localization agreement and as a result, we will not be offering stretch goals for this campaign. However, it should be noted that our Deluxe Piece Pack is a Kickstarter Exclusive item not available anywhere else and will not be offered into retail distribution.  We do reserve the right to offer the Deluxe Piece Pack at conventions, direct from our website, or for other promotional purposes. \nInstead of stretch goals, throughout the campaign we will be revealing more about each character and how they work and showing off some simulated puzzles you can try to solve. Don't worry, we'll change things so they won't be from the actual game (no spoilers!) \nWe'll follow this map starting with a Kik update on November 15th!\nThe books are soft cover with good quality and no binding issues. The map and rules are printed on card stock and the cardboard box has a magnetized enclosure and is of good quality with color printing inside an out. The Crusoe Crew game will not be printed at the same printer where we printed the first printing of the Graphic Novel Adventures books. As with all of our products, we stand behind the quality and if there are any issues we will happily take care of you.\nAuthor and Artist: Shuky and Gorobei\nEnglish text layout, editing, and development: Shaun Varsos, Evan Derrrick, and A.J.

Any request for refund after more than two weeks has passed will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and administrative expenses.\n\nAbandoned Pledges\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time.

We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project. \n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them.

Players assume the role of ship Captains plying the mains of the Third Imperium.\nThe game has been designed to accommodate 2-4 players, but it also supports solo play and we anticipate releasing special solo play scenarios and game modes.  Single and two-player games should last between 30 and 60 minutes, though early learning games will take longer.\nTraveller is a customizable card game, which means you get to make your own deck.  However, it is not collectable.  There are no rarities.  Every product is a fixed set, so you always know exactly what you're getting. \nYou can learn more about our game from our website, forums, facebook, twitter and boardgamegeek pages.\nThe Digital Version\nThis Kickstarter is a follow up to our original 2016 project.  Now we hope to take the physical card game and bring it to an online platform where captains can play with others at any time, anywhere in the world.\nCurrently the game is in what we'd call pre-alpha.  The shell of the game rules have been programmed in, but we haven't converted all the cards yet.  That's where you come in!  The funds from this Kickstarter will be used to cover the costs associated with finishing the online version.\nThe initial focus is on two player, captain vs. captain play.  That base should be sufficient to allow for the solo play scenarios as well, though programming them in hasn't been started.\nPlatforms\nCurrently the pre-alpha build works with Windows, Mac and Linux.  We'd like to follow up with Android and iOS, which our design team tells us is feasible, though it will take a good amount of UI work and some additional programming.\nExample of Play\nOur basic mechanics are an icon-driven race game, with ample opportunities to interact with, and even engage in piracy against, other players. All Captains must also contend with a hostile galaxy and the looming threat of insolvency.\nGame play proceeds through six phases.\nReady (ready cards, refill hand, determine initiative and prepare for the rest of the round)\nAdventure (play Complication cards, decide which Contract to pursue, or declare Piracy!)\nProcurement (procure permanents into play)\nAction (alternate taking actions)\nResource (collect resource tokens)\nResolution (Resolve Complications, fulfill Contracts and conduct Piracy)\nThe full rulebook is available for download from our website.\nRewards\nSome of our rewards are digital, and some are physical.  When selecting reward tiers or Add Ons, please carefully review.  If you're not sure, post in the comments or send us a message and we'll be happy to help!\nAll physical rewards will require backers to pay actual shipping costs.  Shipping costs will be calculated upon the conclusion of the campaign, when we send the backer surveys.\n Will the custom cards for TAS and Patron members be digital-only?\nNo, the custom cards for the Traveller's Aid Society and Patron reward tiers will be available in both the print and digital formats. In fact, every card is going to be available in both formats!\nThe Digital Promo Pack, a collection of special promotional cards,is included to all backers at the Low Passage level and higher.

After being called to the bar, he worked in criminal defense and indigent legal services at places such as the Santa Clara County Public Defenders and the Bay Area Legal Aid Domestic Violence Restraining Order Clinic. After that, he entered private practice, primarily focused on indigent representation for Alameda County.  \nHe has been gaming all his life, first as a mascot and henchman in his father\u2019s gaming group, then a full member, before eventually becoming a game master of his own groups. Some of his favorite games include Traveller, RuneQuest, Through the Breach, Shadowrun, Vampire: The Masquerade, and Fading Suns. \nFor the last 10 years, Jeff has been Assistant RPG Coordinator for Kublacon, one of the West Coast\u2019s largest gaming conventions. He can usually be seen at the major Bay Area cons. \nIan Lee (Lead Developer) started playtesting CCGs in the late \u201890s, eventually working on more than half-a-dozen games sold by several publishers. He then worked on the design team for the Precedence CCG titles, Babylon 5 and Wheel of Time, during which he acquired experience in managing the interplay between CCG mechanics and maintaining the thematic draw of licensed IPs. \nIn addition to having been a certified judge for Magic: The Gathering competitive events, Ian was active in several CCG competitive play circuits, achieving Top Ten world-wide rankings in Babylon 5, Ultimate Combat and Vampire: The Eternal Struggle. \nHe brings over 20 years\u2019 experience, having participated in numerous CCGs in virtually every role, from player, competitive player, playtester and design and development. A fixture on the Northern California gaming convention circuit, he has been running a variety of RPG, CCG and board game events at local cons for over two decades.\nMatt Morgan (Lead Programmer) is our in-house programmer, with an almost unhealthy degree of mastery over both programming and gaming!  He has worked in multiple roles and disciplines, including back and front-end development, DevOps, testing and cloud architecture.  Matt was also the programmer for Chromancer.  Unfortunately the business decisions taken by the project's creator and the company meant that backers were never able to play the game, but Matt's work in it was first rate! \nTony Yin (Project Manager) is a 'first generation' gamer who played Chainmail and Greyhawk at the infancy of D&D. He also played Runequest in its early days, in the campaign of one of its authors, Warren James, at the old San Jose area gaming cafe, The Bandersnatch. Tony also began his adventures in the Third Imperium at about the same time. He still has a full set of LBBs, all with price tags showing just how much further a buck went in 1981. \nIn addition to RPGs, he was a fierce competitor in the board games Star Fleet Battles and Squad Leader. Having attended the first PacificCon, his passion for gaming remains strong to this day, especially for MMORPGS such as Eve and World of Warcraft, and 4x titles like Master of Orion and Civilization. \nTony has over 30 years of experience in the Silicon Valley, and has had extensive dealings with contract manufacturers (CM) in Asia since the late 90's. He has decades of experience developing and launching consumer and commercial products, including packaging, print, logistics, traffic, and material management. \nAs a native born Chinese speaker, Tony is able to handle not just the planning and management of a project, but direct communication with various manufacturers and distributors. \nLocation for the Demonstration of Play video by Collector's Legion:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/collectorlegion/\nMusic in the videos provided by: http://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/2", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe card game and all associated art assets already exist, and our programmer is in house.

We jam-packed all of the Catacombs you love into this campaign!\nREWARDS\n  Unlocked stretch goals are included in all pledge levels.\nADD-ONS\n STRETCH GOALS\nCatacombs is a dexterity based, one vs many dexterity dungeon crawl. Four heroes are selected to protect the town of Stormtryne by battling their way through countless enemies before finally facing the dreaded Catacomb Lord.\nEach hero has their own unique set of actions, abilities, items or spells that aid them through the various rooms and encounters.\nThe Overseer player controls the monsters and the Catacomb Lord, acting as the adversary the heroes aim to defeat.\nThere is a near limitless combination of rooms to explore. Some rooms have a swarm of monsters that the heroes must fight through to succeed. Others provide unique encounters where the heroes can spend their hard earned gold on new items, healing services, or even gamble to gain every edge they can against the Overseer player.\nThe actions a character may take are determined by the rules provided on their cards in the form of shot sequences. Each shot does something different. Some do varying amounts of damage, while others can freeze opponents, scare them off, or teleport allies out of danger, to name a few. There are dozens of shots in Catacombs.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nJust using a shot doesn't always guarantee its action, however. In order to be effective, players will have to train their dexterity skills and accurately flick wooden discs. Ducking in and out of cover, positioning shots, and banking attacks off obstacles are essential skills to an experienced player.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\nIf the heroes live long enough to breach the Catacomb Lord's Lair, they will meet their final test - battling the Catacomb Lord them self!\nRubber Playmats!\nWith the new Catacombs playmats, you will enjoy an incredibly smooth and consistent flicking experience. All of the premium playmats are our standard 12.6 x 26.8\" (320 x 680 mm) size.\nWall & playmat dimensions.\nEvery playmat has two unique designs, one on either side. Enjoy a wide variety of room settings to complement the fantasy experience of Catacombs.\nThree different mats, six unique sides. Prototype mats shown, actual product may vary.\n The surface of the playmats are a very fine cloth weave, which is smooth to the touch. This allows the wood discs to glide across with impressive precision, making every shot satisfyingly consistent.\nBigger, better box.\nWe shrunk down the height and width of the box, making it Kallax shelf friendly. Then we increased the depth, to make room for the new rubber mats. In addition, there's now plenty of room for expansion content, and a new plastic tray.\nGloomhaven box for size comparison. Prototype shown.\nFits in your Kallax shelf.\nImproved Wall System\nWith this printing, we are introducing our custom plastic cross stands for the barrier walls. These eliminate the old hinged design, which were prone to tearing. We also doubled the wall thickness for rigidity. These improvements result in a very sturdy and more resilient wall system.\nAnimated GIFs may take a moment to load.\n\nNo More Holes, Bigger Obstacles!\nWe removed the obstacle holes from the play surfaces, replacing them with obstacle icons, just like in Catacombs & Castles. This allows us to have different obstacle placements between the two sides. With no holes, you can even use your awesome new playmats with your other games!\nWith this change, the previous obstacle discs became too light to stay in place. As such, we have increased their size by five times.\nBrand New Tutorial Manual\nIn addition to the revamped reference manual, we have written a brand new manual with a comprehensive step by step walk-through of an entire game. Learning Catacombs just got a lot easier.\n MANUALS\nTake a look at our fully revised and updated reference manual, and our brand new tutorial manual! Both manuals are subject to change.\nThe tutorial manual provides a brief overview of the game, and a comprehensive step by step walk-through for beginners. The reference manual has not been stripped of any rules, so you do not have to skip back and forth (like some other dual manual games do).\n REVIEWS\nPlease note that the components shown in the videos below are from previous printings and will not reflect the newer, improved iteration of the game.\nDexterity Game System & Deximat logos.\nCatacombs Third Edition is one of a number of tabletop games that are designed using Elzra\u2019s Dexterity Game System\u2122. The Dexterity Game System\u2122 sets a standard of flicking mechanics that are common between all Dexterity Game System\u2122 titles, making them easy to pick up and learn.\nElzra\u2019s Deximat\u2122 branded playmats are made of high quality neoprene and are integrated with our dexterity based game titles. They provide a smooth surface so that each of your Catacombs adventures are consistent and exciting.\n For customer support:\n Please email: ks@elzra.com\nPlease note also that we cannot respond to specific customer support requests on the comments page of this project. You will be directed to email ks@elzra.com.

If you fail to confirm your pledges after this deadline, your rewards will be shipped to you from the Elzra warehouse in Canada. As such, shipping costs may be considerably higher for those outside of Canada and the US.\nOur guiding policy is that our backers receive their rewards before they are made available at retail or conventions. We will make our best effort to adhere to this policy, however we may not be able to meet this goal in some cases. If this is a concern, we encourage you to wait until the retail release of the game.

For this campaign, we are using the same overseas production team and printer that produced Catacombs Conquest.\n\nFor this campaign, we will continue to use a Pledge Manager to manage customer orders and to mitigate miscommunication related to shipping address changes.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced overseas: printer production schedules, major holidays (especially Chinese New Year), shipping, and customs delays. We will work diligently to minimize these types of disruptions and promise to communicate transparently with our backers if they occur.\n\nWe have estimated delivery for April 2019. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe have prepared as much as possible for a successful project (the core artwork assets have already been approved by the printer). \n\nIf the product cannot be produced and/or delivered due to some unforeseen circumstance, we will refund pledges.\n\n=======\nRefunds\n=======\n\nRefunds may be given within 60 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

Likewise, all of the quests and encounters can be run as individual one-off games or strung together to create a full story arc.\nThis book also doubles as a graphic novel collection of the webcomic's second chapter which can be enjoyed separately from the game, or together!\nThis book is supplemented with a digital bundle that includes everything you need to print and play the game including:\n\u00b7 Character Sheets and Map Markers\n\u00b7 NPC Sheets and Map Markers\n\u00b7 Three Brand New Maps\n\u00b7 Trap Tiles\n\u00b7 Enchanted Woods Travel Tiles\n\u00b7 Loot Cards\nIn addition to the Mystery of the Moon Stone adventure module, this Kickstarter will fund the publication of the first full-length Sidekick Quests rule book. So far, all of our rules have been made available in an abbreviated quick-start format that can be downloaded on the Sidekick Quests website. Now, for the first time ever, we have a fully fleshed-out book that covers character roles, advanced mechanics, character advancement, the ins and outs of the Kingdom of Chivel setting, and more.\nFinally, we have some beautiful pieces planned for stretch goals that will be rewarded to everyone who pledges at and above the $30 level. This includes heavy duty punch-out cards for the shifting map mechanics in two of our quests, a Sidekick Quests GM screen, and even a reprint of our first adventure book: The Secret of the Sewer Wizard for those who may have missed our first successful Kickstarter.\nSidekick Quests is an all-ages role-playing game designed to be an introduction to the genre for those who have never played before, specifically children and student as young as kindergartners! This is the second volume of Sidekick Quests. It tells the adventure of the Mystery of the Moon Stone as both a full length graphic novel and as a roleplaying game campaign! The story and game are both created with families in mind, so adults can read the comic with children and then play together through the quests and encounters detailed within. The GM and players can read the story, get a first-hand look at what their characters can do, and then sit down and relive the events themselves.\nSidekick Quests  introduces all the standard mechanics like movement, initiative order, abilities, combat and drama you'd expect in a roleplaying game. Players protray character roles featuring a diverse cast of adventuring sidekicks that are pre-made for quick play but with room for enough customization to truly make them your own. Abilities and skills are clearly labeled with a system of colors and icons for quick and easy reference, and advancing your character\u2019s strengths is a simple matter of exchanging gold stars earned in-game.\nSidekick Quests the RPG is meant to introduce younger players to the world of roleplaying games in hopes that both children and adults could play together and still have a fun and unique experience. Many of the rules in Sidekick Quests are simplified specifically for ease of play with younger players. \nThousands of players of all ages have already enjoyed the print to play versions available for sale at the sidekickquests.com online store.

Part roleplaying game, part web comic, it's unique, and delightful. Kids and parents alike will love James Stowe's lively, wonderful creation - as my daughter and I already do. - John Kovalic, cartoonist and illustrator\n[James Stowe\u2019s] world and characters captures imaginations in young and old alike. Sidekick Quests is doing a huge part to seed the next generation of tabletop gamers with positive messages and healthy table habits that encourage inclusiveness and fair play. You cannot go wrong laying down your hard-earned dollars on this campaign. - Brian Patterson, cartoonist and creator of d20Monkey\n[Sidekick Quests] feels like the best game of DND you played as a twelve year old indoor kid, in all the best ways. - Chris O\u2019Neil, Kobolds Ate My Baby and 9th Level Games  \nSidekick Quests is engaging, dynamic, and everything that a kid's RPG should be. It's got old-school charm, indie sensibilities, and is just plain fun. - Tracy Barnett, Exploding Rogue Studios\nJames took what could've been a one-off internet meme and turned it into an earnest love letter to fantasy adventure. - Daniel Solis, award-winning game designer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery publishing project carries risks. Sidekick Quests is written, illustrated, developed and directed by King Octopus Games; two dedicated game makers, James Stowe and Anna Izenman. If either James and Anna are to be struck by lightning or encounter personal emergencies it will have a bigger impact on the completion of this project than a larger company might see. \n\nThis is the second Sidekick Quests kickstarter for James Stowe. The first, The Secret of the Sewer Wizard, was a success but there were delays in production. We learned a lot from that first kickstarter. First, both books involved in this kickstarter are over 75% written already. The writing is intended to be completely finished by the end of this campaign. Also all the stretch goals add to the quality of the finished product. We intend to use a fulfillment service to handle distribution. Sidekick Quests is no longer a one man operation either. Now development is handled by the small team of King Octopus Games. \n\nKing Octopus Games uses outside suppliers and shippers for printing and manufacturing, which involves possible risks and delays that we can\u2019t foresee or control.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Receive Project Updates", "descp": "Donate at this level to follow our progress and receive all project updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2018"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Single PDF", "descp": "Choose a PDF download of either the Mystery of the Moon Stone adventure module or the Sidekick Quests Rule Guide, as well as the digital bundle.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Both PDFs", "descp": "You will receive a PDF download of both Mystery of the Moon Stone and the Rule Book as well as the digital bundle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}], "stat": ["41 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Single Book", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and a PDF download of one book of your choice, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Both Books", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and PDF download of both The Mystery of the Moon Stone and the Rule Book, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["77 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "One Book and a Sketch", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and PDF download of one book of your choice, a sketch of your favorite Sidekick Quests character, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Both Books and a Sketch", "descp": "You will receive a physical copy and PDF download of both books, a sketch of your favorite Sidekick Quests character, the digital bundle, and all unlocked stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Be a Part of the Game - Single Book", "descp": "Back at this level and we will name a piece of Sidekick Quests lore after you!

Facebook | Twitter | Discord | Newsletter\nOmno is a single player adventure that will take you through lush forests, across a sun blasted desert, over a frigid tundra, and where the power of a lost civilisation will even carry you to the clouds. On the way you will meet strange creatures, encounter many surprises and maybe make a friend.\n\nBesides offering an interactive world, Omno challenges you with puzzles, hidden secrets and obstacles to overcome in 3D puzzle platformer style.\n\nIf you want to see Omno in action, here is some gameplay footage of the game:\nThe world of Omno is teeming with creatures great and small for you to observe and interact with. Shy crab-like rocks, helpful turtles, maybe even a friendly dinosaur to ride?\nYou must unlock the hero\u2019s true potential and master unique skills to continue their journey.\nYour magic staff is the key to powering forgotten relics, and will allow you to dash lighting fast across platforms, glide over land, sail above the clouds and more!\nThe game covers a wide variety of landscapes and is built with state-of-the-art development tools and tricks (I sometimes show behind the scene stuff in my newsletter if you are interested) to create vast areas while ensuring a stable framerate.\nThe audio of Omno features a melancholic, mysterious and at times epic  soundtrack. For the music of the trailer I worked with the versatile and experienced composer Benedict Nichols and I hope I can keep up this great collaboration with the help of the backers.\nI have been working on Omno for over 2 years (the last 8 months fulltime) and now I would say Omno is about 60% complete. I took a lot of time to nail down the tech behind the game which is pretty much done already! Also all the core mechanics are finished and all worlds are in a playable stage.\nThe main thing missing is putting all pieces together, replacing placeholders with actual assets and adding way more animals, a lot of secrets to discover and overall more love to the game, which takes time of course.\nOmno is developed by myself (Jonas Manke), a solo indie dev from Germany. Before Omno I gained production experience as a freelance animator for 10 years on many movies and games (lately 'State of Decay' series - check my personal website or IMDB for more). Working for myself in this competitive environment not only helped me gain a lot of experience in game development but also in planning projects, setting realistic deadlines and budgets. I met great people and inspiring artists along my way who I talk to on a daily basis to receive the hardest and highly qualified feedback.\nOmno is currently planned to release on Steam (Windows) in the second half of 2019, though I would love to port the game to other platforms (Switch, PS4, XBOX) if there is enough funding for it.\nThe game will support gamepad and keyboard input at launch and will release in English, though I might add further languages down the line.\nthe actual look might differ from this image\nWhile running a Kickstarter campaign comes with a lot of risk and requires a great deal of work, there are several reasons why I think a crowdfunding campaign makes a lot of sense for Omno:\nDeveloping the game together: Since the beginning of Omno I have always listened to feedback and enjoyed talking with fans of the game, and a Kickstarter campaign means I would be able to get even more direct feedback from backers.\nCreative freedom: While there is a good amount of interest from publishers for Omno I would love to stay independent and finish the game with complete creative freedom.\nMoney (of course): The money raised by the Kickstarter would mostly be used to cover my living costs for the end of development and to pay some additional collaborators for music and sound. If the campaign is overfunded I have lots of ideas for stretch goals (did someone say consoles? ;) ).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019m probably not the first one to tell you that game development always bears certain risks.

Together you\u2019ll face deadly foes, find treasures that are permanently added to your starting decks, and earn experience that you'll spend to improve your characters' skills, abilities, and starting health. \nAdd-Ons\nTo order an add-on, just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount.

Your opponents won't know what your quests are, but you may show your quests to your teammates. \nAt the beginning of the game, shuffle the Relic cards and deal one face down into a \"relic pile\" for each quest card in the game. When you complete a quest, reveal it to all players, then you acquire a random relic from the relic pile for free.\nThe extra relics (those not in the relic pile) get shuffled into the market deck, adding powerful new items to the market. \nThe Ancestry Pack\nThis 20-card pack allows you to play Hero Realms as a Dwarf, Elf, Ogre, Orc, or Smallfolk. You can use any race with a generic starting deck, or combine them with any character pack. So you could play as an ogre wizard, an elven ranger, a dwarven fighter, or any one of the dozens of new race-class combinations. That means tons of options for the makeup of your party for cooperative play, and literally hundreds of possible new PVP match-ups. \nEach race comes with four cards.\nAn Ancestry card that shows that race\u2019s health modifications and any special rules that apply to that race.\nAn ancestral skill or ability card that starts the game in play. \nAnd two cards that modify your starting deck. \nEvery race has its own strengths and weaknesses, giving them a unique play feel while still being an even match against each other or against a standard human deck.\nThe Lost Village Campaign Deck\nYou now stand in Rathiel\u2019s office, where the Lord-Governor of Thandar has given you and each of your companions a title \u2013 Defender of Thandar \u2013 and a new mission.\n\u201cGo to Heart\u2019s End. Go and find out what happened there. Perhaps this Ruinos Sect is again up to some malevolence.\u201d\n\"What has befallen he people of Heart\u2019s End?\", you ask.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem,\u201d the Lord-Governor says. \u201cThe entire village is missing. Two weeks ago a trio of tithe priests vanished on their rounds. They were last seen on the road to Heart\u2019s End. At the request of the High Priest, I sent a small troop of soldiers to investigate. Only their captain returned.\u201d\nThe Lord-Governor gestures to a guardsman who opens a side door. A man who must be the captain is helped into the room and gently lowered into a chair. He looks freshly bathed and his clothes are clean, but his eyes are unfocused and you sense his mind is far from this room.\nThe Lord-Governor kneels next to the captain\u2019s chair. He clasps the man\u2019s hand and speaks softly. \u201cThese are friends, Goran. Tell them what you told me. Tell them about Heart\u2019s End.\u201d\nGoran\u2019s head lolls for a moment, and you fear the captain is about to lose consciousness. Then he opens his mouth. His voice is trembling and you struggle to make out the words. \u201cGone\u2026 all gone.\u201d\n\"Do you mean the  villagers are dead?\" you ask in soft, calm voice, trying not to upset him further.\n\u201cNot dead\u2026 no\u2026 bodies...\u201d Goran frowns as if remembering something and then his face pales. He stands suddenly, knocking the Lord-Governor back, and his terrified eyes dart around the room. \u201cRed eyes!\u201d he shouts, \u201cRed eyes! Red eyes!\u201d\n\u201cHold him,\u201d Rathiel commands, and two guardsman restrain the struggling captain. After a short struggle Goran\u2019s eyes roll back, and you realize the poor man has lost consciousness. After the guardsmen carry the captain from the room, the Lord-Governor addresses you. \u201cYou now have the same knowledge I do. Please. Go to Heart\u2019s End and bring me answers.\u201d\nThis campaign deck features a full color adventure book and over 100 cards including 12 oversized Master cards!  \nVideos and Reviews\nProject Notes\nShipping\nWe will be shipping to backers directly from fulfillment centers in The US, EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our fulfillment centers, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in some regions may receive product before backers in others.\nIMPORTANT - For this Kickstarter you will be charged shipping separately after this Kickstarter concludes. This will be done via the Pledge Manager which will be sent out early next year. What you are charged for shipping will be base on our actual cost to get your rewards to you from your regions fulfillment center.  \nHere is an estimate of shipping cost by region. Keep in mind this is just an estimate and cost may vary based on the size and weight of your package based on the quantity of unlocked stretch goals and add-ons you choose to get. \nUSA (Contiguous 48): $10-$16\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico: $15-$30\nCanada: $19 - $29\nEU: $18 - $27\nNorway, Switzerland: $33-$39\nChina, Macoa, Hong Kong: $12-$19\nRest of Asia $21-$33\nAustralia $21-$30\nNew Zealand $21-$36\nRest of the World: $43-$79\nUnfortunately we don't ship to Afghanistan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia, or Ukraine.  \n*Kickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Kickstarter exclusives will eventually (in a year or two) be remade with new art for general sale. \nThe Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art. \nNothing is final until it is printed. \nWe are still doing playtesting and development of these sets, so cards may change. All art, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change. The final versions you receive may not exactly match what is pictured here.\n A closer look at the add-on playmats: \nFearless Charge Playmat\nPhoenix Plume Playmat\nKeening Bat Form Campaign Playmat\nEnraged Bear Campaign Playmat\nLaughing Shadow Campaign Playmat\nRuinos Archpriestess Campaign Playmat", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nComponents, including art and layout is subject to change before the final product ships.\n\nWith any printing, there is risk of delay in the proofing, printing or packing steps. With overseas printing there are additional possible delays from shipping and customs. \n\nAlso, we tend to be perfectionists, and sometimes we will do multiple redesigns to get the game play just right. \n\nThe estimated delivery date for this Kickstarter is December 2019, but please keep in mind this is just an estimate. We will work hard to ship your games on time, but our number one concern is that the games be awesome. If we have to delay delivery to improve the product, we will.\n\nBased on delays in delivery of our recent Kickstarters, we added a buffer to this estimated delivery date, so while it is possible we may deliver earlier than this date, it may also be later. If later delivery would be a serious problem for you, please consider not backing and waiting to pick up the product in its retail release instead.\n\nWe are pretty active on the comments while the Kickstarter campaign is live, so we can get your feedback and input.

These will give you some points but also additional pieces as rewards. Since you also keep the pieces you used to finish puzzles, your pool of pieces starts to grow.\nMaster the Strategy \u2014 Once you've built a sufficient pool of pieces to challenge the black (difficult) puzzles and even more of them at the same time, unleash the Master action! It allows you to put a piece on all of your puzzles in a single action.\nWin the game \u2014 Once the black puzzles are gone, the game ends as you rush to complete your remaining puzzles in the final round.

Newton Corporation, the most beloved company that ever existed, gifted the world with the hyper-local gravity engines and, together with them, eternal peace and prosperity. However, to provide an outlet for all the violence innate in humans in such periods of peace and to amuse the crowds, Newton Corporation sponsors a brutal distraction: the Zero Gravity Tournament. In this capture-the-flag game, you control a team of warriors whose life is devoted to entertaining the masses. Use the 3D arena to overthrow your enemies and please the public, score Cheers to win the match! \nWatch the gameplay 360-videos in the section\"FULL GAMEPLAY & RULES\".\n                                 In Zero Gravity, you control a team of 14 warriors in a spectacular capture-the-flag match. To win a game you need to score the agreed number of Cheers before the other players.  \nRULES\nBefore you start the game: \nSetup phase (once per game): choose your starting area and place your first Spawning Point, your Flag and your team's Commander; place the bomb at the center of the bottom side of the arena and set the target amount of Cheers needed to win the game.\nAfter you start the game, the game is based on Rounds, each one made of four phases:\nRestock phase: add new N-coins to your stock (2 + bonus earned during the game) and draw 2 Sponsor Cards;\nTrooper phase: generate 1 new Trooper close to each Spawning Point and perform an action with each one of your Troopers at no cost (Move/Attack, Run);\nChampion phase: use your N-coins to generate new Champions and perform actions with them (Move/Attack, Run, Jump, Power Jump or Drop) in order to score Cheers;\nScenario phase: roll 2 dice to randomly place new Crates and/or Beasts into the arena, then move them and use their abilities.\nThe first player that reaches the target amount of Cheers wins the game!\nSee the following sections for further details on the teams, game components and rules.\nTEAMS OVERVIEW\nThere are four teams fighting in the Zero Gravity arena: the Nordic Sharks, the Milwaukee Eagles, the Moscow Jackals and the Tokyo Demons. Each Team is composed of four Champions (1x Commander, 1x Sniper, 1x Jumper, 1x Harrier) and 10x Troopers: each player controls a team of fourteen right out of the box. All such miniatures are called Units and Zero Gravity contains 56 of them, all 40mm magnetic miniatures.\nEvery Team brings its own individual set of movements and attacks, but also unique abilities that set them apart from the others and affect all players' strategies.\nFear is meaningless to the Nordic Sharks: the mix of human and shark traits resulted from genetic improvements which also affect their behaviour in battle.  \nTeam Quirk - Hunters: Beasts cannot defend from the attacks of the Nordic Sharks.\nModern Valkyries, the Milwaukee Eagles team shows sculpted bodies and incredibly fast recovery speed. Don\u2019t tease them \u2013 they can hunt you down for eternity.  \nTeam Quirk - Healing Spirits: At the beginning of your Turn: you can restore up to two members of the Milwaukee Eagles by +1 Energy.\nThe Moscow Jackals hunt in packs to herd and capture their elusive prey. If you are looking to outnumber your enemy, this is the right team for you.  \nTeam Quirk - Jackals at the door: At the beginning of your Turn: put in play a Trooper in a cell adjacent to any member of the Moscow Jackals.\nThe Tokyo Demons are cruel cyborgs and ninjas trained to kill...in spectacular ways.  \nTeam Quirk - Warlords: Every time the Tokyo Demons score Cheer(s), add one extra Cheer.\nSPONSOR CARDS\nAt the beginning of the game, after the Setup, the Restock Phase provides the teams with the necessary resources to continue the battle. Newton Corporation allows sponsors to power-up the teams and each player, following turn order, can draw a Sponsor Card with unique abilities.\nSponsor Cards deck\nThere are 30 unique Sponsor Cards in the game, which allow Units to perform stronger attacks, grant special abilities, provide additional resources and much more.  \nExample of Sponsor Cards\nHOW TO SPAWN NEW UNITS \nThe rules set by Newton Corporation, carefully improved year after year, define the Trooper Phase to force the teams to deploy their Troopers before any of their Champions. You can place new Troopers into play and activate all of them for free. This creates a splendid commotion, loved by the crowd, and builds up the Climax of the show: the Champion Phase.\nIn the Champion Phase you can spawn Champions from your Spawning Points, use Sponsor Cards gained in the Restock Phase and, more importantly, activate the Champions. They can Move/Attack (melee, primary or secondary attack), Run, Jump, Power Jump or Drop (see the \"Movement and Attack\" section for further details on the unique mechanics allowed by Zero Gravity arena). \nSpawning Point inside a team's starting area\nHOW TO SCORE CHEERS \nThe objective of each Team is to score the highest possible amount of Cheers or to perform actions that will make this possible in the following Rounds.\nYou can obtain Cheers in the following cases:\nBring an enemy Flag from his/her starting area to your starting area on the opposite side of the arena (e.g. from A1 to B1 or viceversa)  - 15 Cheers \nDetonate the Bomb in the Gate - 10 Cheers \nDestroy an enemy Spawning Point with the Bomb - 8 Cheers \nEliminate an enemy Commander - 5 Cheers \nEliminate an enemy Harrier, Sniper or Jumper - 3 Cheers \nEliminate a Beast - 2 Cheers \nEliminate an enemy Trooper - 1 Cheer\nBring an enemy Flag from his/her starting area to your starting area on the same side of the arena (e.g. from A1 to A2 or vice versa) - 1 Cheer \n  Track your Cheers on your Team Sheet\nUNIQUE MOVEMENT AND ATTACK MECHANICS \nHere follows a summary of the main moves and attacks for all Units and Beasts:\nMOVE\nMove the Unit in any direction, for a number of cells equal to or lower than its Movement score, as indicated on the Team Sheet. \nATTACK\nMelee attacks may be delivered if the Target is adjacent to the Attacker (orange cells in the picture above). \nPrimary Attacks may be delivered if the Line of Sight is free: anything can obstruct the Line of Sight. It is possible to perform Primary Attacks within the same Surface or on the adjacent corridors (yellow cells in the picture above).\nSecondary Attacks may be delivered from the same areas where it is possible to Jump (the Line of Sight is always free). The Target can be in a 3x3 cell area around the corresponding position on the closest surface from their attacking point, as indicated in the illustration above. \nJUMP\nOnly Champions have the ability to Jump from one surface of the board to the corresponding position on the closest surface from their starting point (e.g. G6-G6).\nPOWER JUMP\nChampions have the ability to Power Jump to from one corridor of the board to the diametrically opposed one, on the cell with the same letter from their starting point (e.g. L-L).  \nDROP\nChampions have the ability to Drop from the top surface of the board to the corresponding position on the bottom surface. The landing cell can only be occupied by an Object (Bomb, Mine, Flag, Crate), in which case the appropriate effects can be applied, otherwise the Champions cannot Drop. \nChampions can never Drop from within the Team area.\nBEASTS\nNewton Corporation intervenes in each Tournament to \u201cmotivate\u201d the battling Teams. After the Champion Phase, in the Scenario phase, the player with the least amount of Cheers introduces Beasts in play on behalf of the Newton Corporation. The role of the Beasts is to disrupt a players\u2019 strategy, to bring chaos and shatter the Teams\u2019 spirit to entertain the crowds.\nThere are 30 Beasts (40mm): 10x Minotaur, 10x Minelayer, 10x Replicator.\nMinotaur - Hold in captivity after its creation by the Newton Corporation, the Minotaur is a walking disaster: he can hurl in any direction anyone adjacent to him. The only way to escape his violence is simple: never cross his path. \nMinelayer - In an attempt to create a regenerative bio-weapon, the Newton Corporation gave life to an uncontrollable and unpredictable being, capable of generating explosive mines from its body. Considering its limitless destructive power, there is no better place for it than the Zero Gravity Tournament! \nReplicator - Newton Corporation spent trillions of dollars to develop a faster mitosis, to speed-up the growth of their crops and livestock. The result was unexpected: the cells were reacting only when other Beasts were in the same area, and ended up duplicating only other Beasts. People say that this was the real goal of Newton Corporation, to fuel the never ending needs for the Zero Gravity Tournament...\nMinotaur, Replicator and Minelayer Bests\n OBJECTS & SETTING ELEMENTS \nThe Newton Corporation surely doesn\u2019t leave anything unattended: a special Bomb was developed for the Zero Gravity tournament to spice up the show. A teletransport technique was applied to the Flags of each Team, causing them to reappear in the Teams\u2019 Area if dropped outside. Overall, many other Objects and Setting Elements were created by the best scientists of the Newton Corporation to enhance the experience of the Zero Gravity Tournament: \nFULL GAMEPLAY & RULES \nHere you can find our awesome videos...360 degrees!

We are preparing all the content for the printout version (layout, pictures), thus there will be differences in its final version.\nDownload the DRAFT Rules here.\nCheck the FAQ to find some other details!\nIn the year 2130 humankind was saved by the most disruptive technology of the third millennium: the hyper-local gravity engines, capable of bending the universal law of gravity at the will of its creator - the Newton Corporation. The new technology quickly became an essential part of everyday life, tackling overpopulation by exponentially increasing living space and solving famine with vertical cultivations: in a matter of years, Newton Corporation became the most powerful and notorious company in the world.\nDespite all the good done by Newton Corporation, there were protests, strikes and even revolts of thousands of people who believed that these technological advancements were dangerous for the human species. The strong reputation of Newton Corporation convinced the world leaders to denounce such acts of violence and defend the many research facilities by the military forces.\nMany years passed and with them the protests faded. However, a group of fanatics kept on nourishing their anger and plotted an assault on the headquarters, leading to the murder of the Newton Corporation founder and CEO. The military arrested the culprits who were immediately sentenced to a public execution, to be aired across the planet as a warning against rebellion towards such a global benefactor.\n The execution was followed live by 99% of the world population. This exorbitant share is what pushed Newton Corporation to sponsor a spectacular and bloody event every year. Their goal was twofold: commemorating the punishment inflicted to the rebels and provide a single outlet for violence, so as to experience peace for the future year.\nWith the blessing of all world leaders and population, Newton Corporation developed new technologies capable of cloning the executed rebels, enhancing their abilities and peculiar traits. Four teams were created and sentenced to battle against each other for eternity, in the name of peace.\nFrom the ashes of those rebels new Champions were created: the Zero Gravity Tournament was born.\nZero Gravity comes with the Tournament map. In this 3D space, the players have few obstacles and can concentrate on obliterating each other in a marvellous feast of guns and explosions.  \n MENTIONS FROM THE WEB\n\"Miniatures Sports Hit The Next Level With Zero Gravity Kickstarter.\" - Beasts of War\n                   \"This stunning game innovates to the point where players can enjoy an amazing experience.\" - Reviews Featured\n\"Taking board games to a whole different level, District games has developed a game set that defies the laws of gravity and fun.\"  - Gears 'n' Gadgets\n\"Gravity.

We will be using a pledge manager platform to handle this. If you are an experienced backer, you'll know that we are doing this to be fair since shipping costs vary greatly depending on your location. We will then use a fulfilment company to bring the orders to your doorstep, using the most appropriate warehouse to lower the costs and respect the environment. You can find below a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (5kg volumetric weight). Although costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals, we promise we'll do our best to keep them down. \nWe don't promise short and impossible deadlines: we will fulfil the campaign in the time that it takes to do a perfect job and you will receive your game 6 months after the end of the campaign. The table below gives you a general idea of the schedule once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary.  \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped at a later date. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally (due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us). We truly hope you will enjoy our game!  \nRETAILERS\nZero Gravity will not be available through normal distribution channels after the campaign ends. \nIf you are a retailer and are interested in receiving Zero Gravity including all the unlocked Stretch Goals, you can order multiple copies of the game during the campaign at a discounted retailer price. \nContact us at info@districtgames.it with a proof of your retailer status (VAT number, Tax ID, etc.) to receive information on discounted prices and  retailer pledge process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 2nd Kickstarter.

I've been creating the story at DriveComic.com, and it's entirely free to read (go try it!). And now, it's time to collect the full Act Two into a gorgeous, 256-page hardcover!\n\nDRIVE is my favorite kind of sci-fi: Hilarious characters in a serious story. A mashup of \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" and \"Dune,\" if you will.\nIt's placed in a Second Spanish Empire \u2014 a galactic empire \u2014 which finds itself staring down a war with an alien race called \"The Continuum of Makers\". Humanity has built its empire using technology stolen from the Makers, and these creatures want it back with an almost religious fervor. In the brewing war, it's clear that humanity will lose \u2014 and lose badly \u2014 unless they can find some advantage in battle. That hope arrives in the form of a tiny, mysterious creature who can drive a starship like no one's ever seen. Now all humanity needs to do...is find 10,000 more pilots just like him. But no one knows where he's from.\nThe 256-page hardcover book will be 8.5\"w x 9\"h (21.6cm x 22.8cm) and gorgeously printed! We've already unlocked TWENTY stretch goals...and as we unlock more, your hardcover gets better 'n better -- all at no extra cost to you!\nAaaand, if you didn't get Act One already -- you can get both books in this Kickstarter! \nHere's a quick guide to help you decide what rewards you'd like for backing the project!

You could add an order for the add-on in there.\nPlease note that we will add shipping fee for the add-ons (including all pledge with the add-on items). We will use pledge manager and send the survey 1 - 3 weeks after the campaign ended\nFor Megacorp Premium Item Collection, you will get megacorp music discography (4 songs) even though you didnt see it in the pledge level.\nWhat if everyone you know, loved, and remembered are just complex simulations in a computer-generated universe? What if you began to see through the shroud that separates what you think is your life from what is real? What if you wake up from this simulation, only to wonder if you are in another?\nSimulation Theory is a Boardgame for 1 to 6 players which combines elements of an escape room and a dungeon delve. The game has 3 major modes for different audiences from casual (17 minutes playtime) to hardcore (2+ hours). Simulation Theory is played with a combination of standees, cards, boards, and Dice. The dice are mainly used for tiebreakers.\nSimulation Theory was created by Mark G. Koh (Megacorp), Shawn Siow, and an international team. For the full credits, see team credits below. We put together this Kickstarter campaign because we cannot build this without you.\n\nThe base game will include 3 realities, each with 5 unique characters. The 6th character per reality will be available as a stretch goal. Each of these characters has their own strengths and weakness plus a unique backstory which has a real impact in the Ultimate mode (rules and game components will update soon)\nSeveral ways to play\nCasual mode: Easy to learn and teach, only 15 - 30 mins to play\nChallenge mode: Additional depth for experienced players, try out a special Scenario\nCompetitive mode: Much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery\nUltimate Mode (Stretch goal): A different way to play with branching quests for each character and deterministic gameplay. Directly integrates the story and history of the different Realities together with the gameplay\nCongratulations! You guys made it to unlocked \"Ultimate mode - Stretch goal\". In Ultimate Mode, players need to complete various quests, unique to each Character, to gain treasure and Ascend to the next Reality. Each turn, players also discover part of the story of Simulation Theory and can choose to take different actions towards one of four unique outcomes per Character.  \nThis mode will take a much longer amount of time to play than the casual or challenge mode \u2013 we estimate around 2 hours for a full game with players that are familiar with the other modes of Simulation Theory\nStretch Goal Unlocked : Ultimate Mode\nThis mode rules assume players are already familiar with the Challenge Mode and Comepetitive Mode rules an the basics of Simulation Theory are assumed here.\nSETUP \nChoose one reality. Take it's challenge deck. Find and remove the boos card, shuffle the challenge deck. Place the boss card at the center (3,3) position on the 5x5 board and fill out all the other spaces with the challenge cards face-up on the board from top to bottom, starting left to right. \nShuffle both of coordinate decks (column and row) \nTake the top card of each coordinate deck - showing a pair of coordinates - row and column. \nRandomize the purple generic tokens face down. Take a purple generic token and place it face down (without looking at it) on that position, on top of the card occupying the card at those coordinates. Do this eight times. \nEach player chooses a character from the present reality. \nSetup each player with their story tracker card on the left hand side of their character card. place the life token on \"2\" position and the book token on the \"1\" story node position for each character\n\nFIRST TURN POSITIONS \nDuring the first turn of ultimate mode, players each take their standee and choose a challenge card which is not surrounded by 4 cards orthogonically (e.g.: has a card above, below, left and right of it) - this is that player's STARTING POSITION. Each player's standee must be at least 2 spaces (horizontally or vertically) away from the next player. Two standees can be diagonally next to each other. All players must agree on their positions before the game commences. Players cannot choose a starting position with a token or standee on it.\nTURN SEQUENCE  \nThere are three parts in each turn, a planning phase, an action phase and a quest phase.\nPLANNING PHASE\nDuring the planning phase, all players act simultaneously. Each player chooses which action to perform in this phase:  \n-MOVE  \nMove the character standee into an adjacent space by specifying coordinates with the dice. The space chosen must be horizontally or vertically next to the standee. A move cannot be made into a diagonal space. Do this by placing the two dice on one of the characters traits on the board (the first to represent a row number and the second to represent a column number.) The character must have an equal or higher trait value to the challenge card in order to move onto it, otherwise they will lose one health. Can move onto challenge cards with a token or another standee (e.g.: another player) on it, if they do  \n-REST [recover life]  \nIf a player has 0 life, this is the only action they may perform The player gains 1 life and may not perform any other actions this turn. To perform a heal action. The player places his dice onto a trait of his choice but with the numbers 6/1\nACTION PHASE  \nThe action phase happens after all players are ready and reveal their dice placements. Each player who chose to move, moves their standees now. Then each player that chose the heal action, increases their health by one position. If their standee was lying down (0 health), they now place them upright.\n-INTERACT/ATTACK\nA character that lands on a challenge card with another player/character on it triggers an attack. If a character standee moves into a space with a token on it, this triggers an interaction. Interacting with a PURPLE generic token triggers a story event for that player in the QUEST PHASE -UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST -\n-UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST\nCharacter Quests can be unlocked when a player moves onto a card which is any one part of a 1-3 card pattern matching a quest unlock pattern that that player has. The player must declare it when it happens when they resolve during the QUEST PHASE\nQUEST PHASE During the quest phase players resolve the story items that are triggered due to the course of their actions. \nFor PURPLE TOKENS - these tokens are turned number side up. The player then refers to the ultimate mode manual pdf and will look to \"Encounter Events\" section of that reality and do the actions on encounter events.\nFor CHARACTER QUESTS: these are the quests that are unlocked and are often narratives from a character's memories/past.\nINJURY AND DEATH IN ULTIMATE MODE  \nTaking damage: Characters are dealt damage as a consequence of story events or combat. Whenever a character is dealt damage, move their health that number of positions equal the damage to the left of their life track\nASCENSION IN ULTIMATE MODE  \nAscending from the present reality in ultimate mode is the objective of each session. A player that successfully completes any combination of 7 character quests and events will asend. Failing this, the player that enters the 3/3 position after the final boss of the reality is defeated OR if the final event runs out of time (in ACT 4) will ascend.  \nTHE END OF THE GAME  \nEach session of ultimate mode is set in one reality. The players play until one player Ascends and then the session is finished and scores are taken.\nSCORING IN ULTIMATE MODE  At the end end of each session, each player counts the the following as their score\n1. ascension tokens - the player that ascends receives the gold ascension token and has 20 VP  \n2. treasure - the face value of each treasure card collected counts as VP\n3. Quests - each quest card has a VP value\n4. EVENTS -each major events card has a VP value\n5. HEALTH - every point of health a player has at the end of the session converts to 1VP\n6. Trait tokens - take the total number of positive trait tokens minus the number of negative trait tokens a character has, this converts to VP \nRETAINING SCORE\nEach player should record down their scores for an ultimate mode session. The scores should be cumulative into the next session. Until all available realities are completed, the final winner is the player with the highest total score of all sessions\nBasic Gameplay: Casual Mode\nThis describes fundamental core mechanics only: the game has much more to offer in two other modes\nSimultaneous Turns\n\nPlanning Phase: Secretly select which card to hit, and which trait to use\nEveryone simultaneously reveals their plan\n Action Phase: Compare your stats to the card\nMiss - Leave the card face up for later\nWin - Gain a treasure!\nLose - Skip the next turn, or discard a treasure\n\nPlan well and you could encounter rival players in the same location to help or hinder.\nAscend through the three Realities\nDefeat the boss or find the Exit and wake up in a new Reality. Gain a new Character to face new challenges, or return to your previous Reality with Godlike power.\nAscending\nGain a new character\nFill board with new reality challenge cards\nGames End\nThe game ends after someone ascends from the third Reality\nAdvanced gameplay : Competitive mode\nDownload and try the free print and play here.\nTry Simulation Theory on Tabletop simulator here.\nNote: The game pieces in both the print and play and the tabletop simulator only have rudimentary art instead of the illustrations used for the final production version.\nExplore three different realities. Which one is real? Who knows\nThe Stone  \nLegend has it that millennia ago, a star fell from the heavens crashed into the world of Gaeus. It is said that this stone is imbued with such vast power that anyone that touches the stone would perish. Other stories claim that instead of dying from its touch, someone worthy would be able to wield its Godlike power. The stone was thought to be lost but has been rediscovered when a mighty quake cracked the earth asunder, revealing the ancient temple that was built around it. As it is, the primacy of the 8 God Kings is threatened by a warlord immune to their magic, who is also amassing a tremendous horde. Heroes have experienced fevered dreams, brought about by the stone calling to them.\nYou are one such stoneseeker. You awake disoriented, having lived some other life in a place where magic does not exist and the God-kings do not rule.\nThe land of Teres, where the stone fell, is now a hotbed of political intrigue, with adventurers and royals alike gambling their lives on reaching the stone first. And through it all, a horrid otherworldly blight twists all life it touches as it spreads unchecked. Will the stone grant you the power to fulfill your wishes?\nThe Prison  \nYou awake, wearing a prison jumpsuit and strapped to a Virtual Reality machine. You are deep in the bowels of a black site that officially does not exist; Level 44.\nThe prison is the infamous Simbulan Penitentiary, located in the city of San Miguel. The prison is privately owned and staffed by sadistic ex-criminal guards and robotic EXA units.\nBut you are not in any normal cell. The machine you were connected to moments ago should induce Virtual Enhanced Interrogation. The technology is so advanced that the life you just experienced feels more real than the shithole you are now trapped in. None of this is even remotely legal, even by the corrupt standards of San Miguel.\nSuddenly the locks on your cell open as a prison riot rages throughout the facility. The supermax inmates have spilled over into the black site, taking over section by section in a murderous rage. Is it too late to escape? Is it too late for answers?\nThe Ark  \nAfter the near-apocalyptic singularity event on Earth, the newly risen AI's left behind a seemingly benevolent member of their kind, GENECIA. Her intervention veered humanity away from the brink of extinction, by providing them the gift of viable long-distance space travel. A part of that gift is the designs of the Genisis Ark. Like millions of others, you are on one such Ark. Yours is headed toward P4-11, a habitable planet.\nYou awake in a cryo-pod as one of the privileged few who went on this journey to a new home with their entire body intact. Less important colonists only had their brains transported, awaiting their bodies to be reconstructed when the new world is settled.\nThe Ark has virtual reality programs to keep the minds of those in stasis active. Your VR sim was strange, almost entirely too real. That, and you were woken too soon. Alarms are blaring, the life support system seems to have been damaged. The ship's AI is mysteriously absent. Where is the captain? Can you save the mission? Can you save yourself?\n\nDesigner note: We didn't just 'tack on some lore' for our game - we take storytelling very seriously.

Learn the basics here. \n\nThis is a simple 1v1 playthrough in casual mode in a hotel room\nRemember that all our playthrough videos use rudimentary placeholder art. Please do not judge the components by what you see here. The standees and the main board components are not shown.\nThe purpose of these videos is to demonstrate the core mechanics and craftsmanship of STG's game design. The two other game modes (challenge/adventure) build on the knowledge from playing casual mode at least once.\n Challenge mode utilizes the basic rule framework of the game to deliver almost infinite replayability with Challenge scenarios (you can try the ones below with the print and play!). Believe us, it is almost like designing an entirely new game each time.\n\"Arkfall\" - 4 Players - Stone Reality Scenario\n                                                                                                        \"Decontamination Protocol\" - 3 players - Prison Reality Scenario\nCompetitive mode is a much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery. The challenge cards are dealt face up in a 5x5 grid, with the boss card at its center. Ascensions move the boss.\nPlaythrough video of Competitive mode in Singapore\nWhat Others Says About Simulation Theory Game\nIGN Post-launch (SEA)\nIGN Pre-launch (SEA)\nGames Hub (Malaysia)\nTantrum House - on 37:50 mark in the podcast (USA)\nGame It (Spain)\nDAGeeks (Philippines)\nBoard Game Geek (USA)\nMany thanks to Lytt Labs for manufacturing the official STG watch!

That is why I agreed to get on board and help with the writing. I am going to speak candidly here and say that once I got here things were a little helter-skelter, to say the least; and Mark K\u2019s requests were on the ambitious side. That said, it was a great opportunity to present a little something of myself to share with all of you and I hope you all will feel it fun to experience. Some details. The stone reality and ark reality has been written and is currently being conformed into the Ultimate Mode (Scenario) format. Stone abilities are done, with the prison and ark realities being playtested and worked on. Everything\u2019s permitted and nothing is forbidden... In the Ultimate Mode, I have taken the creative license to divert from the Megacorp canon of the realities. Stone, prison and ark. My reason for doing so is to provide a more streamlined experience where the focus is on the Ultimate Mode\u2019s story and gameplay. For example, in the Stone Reality, we follow in the steps of one of the \u2018Paladin\u2019. Players may take turns playing this character or each player may have their own characters throughout the reality. In Ultimate Mode you will use treasures to purchase abilities and customise your characters as you best befitting your play style. Now, imagine the ultimate mode as a play. There will be an Active, Inactive and Required character. Active characters are named characters in the current quest, while inactive characters are characters who have the abilities of the class (prince, wizard, etc) but are not actively participating as a named character.

There is exploration, trade, investigation, space combat, science projects, infiltration, and troubleshooting. We play to find out how the crew gets the job done, the choices they make, the rules they break, and the lengths they will go for their patrons.\nA Free Spacer contingency type corvette recently folded into a system around the core.\nFeatures\nFree Spacer is a roleplaying game with distinct features for science fiction roleplaying, inspired by Cowboy Bebop, Dark Matter, Farscape, Firefly, Killjoys, Switchblade Honey, or the works of Heinlein.\nTrue Sci-fi// At its core, the game has a theme of freedom vs. power in a depiction a future far from now, rather than a retro sci-fi. It is contemporary science fiction that leverages the newest space sciences, takes into account biotechnology, and brings the internet to the rim of the quadrant.  \nCustom Starship// You play the crew of a starship. The ship acts a template for your crew and the type of contracts you take. Together you operate the starship, each taking a ship station.\nSandbox play// Space is big; a vast sandbox of unlimited freedom. Free Spacer provides a series of streamlined and efficient tools to the Gamemaster to prepare locations and characters. These are not just empty places and stat blocks, rather each includes their agenda and faction relationship.\nCold War Phase// The Cold War phase is a faction turn that lets you, the Gamemaster, simulate the faction struggle to control the sector. The phase generates your sector background and gives you prompts to create contracts.\nContract is law// You're a contractor, you live and die by your contract. Like the law, you may break the terms of your contract, but there is a price. The crew negotiates contracts to earn Residual Value \u2013 the value of Cargo, which acts as the in-game experience points.\nProcedural Sector// From the Sector and the great societies at the core of civilisation down to settlements and creatures, Free Spacer has tool to procedurally generate everything. Sit down and build out your own detailed setting or just what you need. Every world, system, and factions will be your own, all while emphasising a real sci-fi galaxy.\nFree Spacers battle their way along the hull of a capital ship\n  Game Mechanics\nFree Spacer uses a unique set of core mechanics designed for science fiction. The system is streamlined, but with crunch that emphasises science and technology. The players roll all the dice and have plenty of knobs to turn.\nTasks// Players roll a pool of ten-sided dice, which represent their crewmember\u2019s skills, specialties, and resources. You roll these task dice against a pool of six-sided dice that represents the task's difficulty.\nResource Management// During play, you have a variety of resources to manage that bestow useful benefits in play. You can spend charge to increase your chance to succeed, trade cargo to earn profit, spend Supply to power gear, and spend Complex Materials to maintain or advance your crewmember, ship, and gear.\nProjects// The game has a set of advanced mechanics known as projects. Projects use the core mechanic, but multiple tasks work together to complete them.\nFree Spacer has been in development for several years and the entire book\u2014rules, setting, GM prep, and game sheets\u2014has extensively playtested in multiple versions. Free Spacer is finally ready for you. To get it into your hands, I need your backing. Your pledges will be used to bring the best possible version of Free Spacer into existence.\nEditing// With the game text complete, I\u2019ve brought in Karen Twelves as the editor. She\u2019s finished her first edit and the book is ready for further editing, indexing, and final tweaks. The Kickstarter will enable Karen to shepherd Free Spacer book to its completion. \nIf we fund, she\u2019ll complete the edit of the revised manuscript in multiple passes and we\u2019ll also hire a proofreader and indexer.\nArt// The art of Free Spacer reflects contemporary science fiction. It is a complex future with multiple elements, like holograms, branding, technology, the internet, the frontier, and space. As the Art Director, Lisa Sapinsky is responsible for all the art throughout the book. She has made a good deal of the art in 3D. She\u2019s using Modo, Substance, and UnReal for the final rendering. She has already commissioned other illustrations, like those you see on this page from John Love and Rocco Commission original Free Spacer Logo. The art promises to be contemporary and beautiful.\nIf the game funds, Lisa will be able to complete the art for the book. That means more of everything. More aliens, creature, and starships in 3D environments. She\u2019ll also add art of your gear, the crew kit that makes you a veteran Free Spacer. Likewise, she\u2019ll add more silhouettes art and in-setting 2D art. On top of the interior art, we are exploring a lot of different cover concepts from the minimal to the complex. To push this to the next level, I have three awesome art stretch goals.\nA Free Spacer contingency type corvette vectors towards orbit of terrestrial giant\nLayout// Amongst my many hats, I enjoy layout art. I\u2019ve already laid out the many play sheets for the game and am making headway with layout tests of the full the book in Adobe InDesign. I am laying out the book as a 6x9 digest with a clean easy-to-read style that directly addresses you as the player or gamemaster. \nIf the game funds, I\u2019ll be finishing a full layout of the book with full hyperlinking.\nActual Play// You may have played a version of Free Spacer at GenCon, GoPlay NW, PAX West, TCTC, Fear the Con, Fan Expo Canada, or Roll20 Con. I have been also running actual plays on Twitch and posting them to YouTube. Even better, Eric Vulgaris has just started to run their own Actual Play series on Thursdays, check is out on their Twitch and YouTube.\nFulfillment// We will do fulfillment through Indie Press Revolution, who will also be handling the post Kickstarter distribution. We are currently looking into other fulfillment services for locations outside the US.\nShipping// We will charge for shipping once the campaign is over using the Backerkit Surveys. Shipping rates will likely change before the games are ready to ship. Please keep this in mind as you pledge.\nRoll20 Support// The game already has ship and crew sheets on Roll20 that you can try out right now. \nIf it funds, the sheets will be upgraded to include Gamemaster character sheets and use the compendium and new charactermancer. Likewise, I want to add more functionality to the sheets to make Roll20 the easiest way to play Free Spacer.\nFree Spacers dealing with an onboard emergency\nHere\u2019s what it is all about! Your reward for supporting this project. Beyond my everlasting thanks, you will get the first copies of Free Spacer and become forever part of the game.\nPreview PDF// As a backer of Free Spacer, you'll get access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. This preview includes all the text and tables with Karen\u2019s first edit. The preview won\u2019t have art, an index, or any extras\u2014just a straightforward layout.\nFree Spacer PDF// As backer of the #drifter level or greater, you\u2019ll receive a copy of the final book as a PDF at the conclusion of the Kickstarter. The final version will be complete with the same text and art as the physical copies of the book. The PDF will be hyperlinked and bookmarked for easy use.\nSector Archive// At the #dataflow level and above you\u2019ll receive a PDF version of the Sector Archives. The Sector Archives is a booklet of pre-prepared setting and campaign materials. It has everything you need to start your campaign with little additional prep. The archives include setting materials and one or more beginning contracts, plus, all the locations and characters you need to run those scenarios. The Sector Archive includes a flexible setting for any sort of play and one based on Eric Vulgaris\u2019 streaming actual play. Stretch goals will add more settings by game talented designers.\nSoftcover book// Those backing at #crewmember level receive a layflat 6x9 softcover book. We\u2019ll be designing the cover art during the campaign and looking to you for feedback. \nHardcover book// Those backing at #veteran, #captain, and #gamemaster level receive a lay flat 6x9 hardcover book. We\u2019ll be putting the cover art together during the campaign and be looking to those that pledge at these levels for feedback. \nPrinted Sector Archive// At the #gamemaster and #captain levels you receive a printed booklet of all the setting information for each Sector Archive to present to your players.\nBe an Example Player// Five awesome backers will become part of Free Spacer. At the #captain level, your name, pronouns, and in-game choices will be immortalised as the example group throughout the text. Every reader will see your name as they learn to play the game.\nAlthough Free Spacer will be a complete Roleplaying game, I want to push it further and make it even better. I have devised two types of stretch goals, those that enhance the book and those that add resources for your game. I hope you will help me get enough people onboard that we can make some of this cool stuff.  \nFree Spacer crew greeting strange new alien sophonts\n[Unlocked] Social Media Pirates\nOnly by promoting the Free Spacer Kickstarter can you free my dangerous pirate supplement. This will be an oppressive setting that puts your faction on the wrong side of every local law. You\u2019re the villains that threaten to tear it all down.\nHow it works// Help promote the game and we\u2019ll add points to a reserve. Once it reaches 2018, we\u2019ll unlock the stretch goal and it will be added to the Sector Archive. \nPromote the game in any of these ways to add points to the Reserve:\n1 point: Join the Free Spacer Facebook group \n1 point: Like the Free Spacer Facebook page  \n1 point: Join the Free Spacer G+ Community \n1 point: Follow the me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/XophRA  \n1 point: Tweet the Kickstarter link with #FreeSpacer \n100 points: If you post a link on any of the above sites to a blog post promoting the Kickstarter, reviewing the preview, or hosting a picture of your group playing Free Spacer.\n200 points: If you run a podcast or stream, schedule an interview with me, and post it before the end of the Kickstarter.\n[Unlocked] $20,000 CAD - Offset Print\nThe game will be printed as a 320 to 400 page 6\"x9\" digest style book in soft and hardcover. We will do an offset print run through Friesens in Manitoba Canada. Friesens is an employee owned premier short run printer founded in 1907 as a family company. I have had a relationship with Friesens since 2009 and I believe I\u2019ll get a beautiful print. Likewise, it was important for us to print locally with a Canadian printer.\nThe Secor Archive will be printed using Lulu or smaller local printer due to the small number of copies. \n[Unlocked] $21,000 CAD - Technician Sector Archive by Kira Magrann\nWhen this stretch goal is unlocked, Kira Magrann will write a Sector Archive for crews that fly the Technician flag. The Papiliocene Sector is well known for its radical advances in technology. Their need for funding and subsequent corrupt practices has led to corporate espionage, worker exploration, and strange new technology that doesn't care much for sentient flesh. The systems here flourish by exporting tech to other systems, but not without cost to the inhabitants under their corporate rule.\nKira is a tabletop roleplaying game designer, queer cyborg, and snake mom living in Columbus, Ohio. She currently has a Patreon where she designs experimental games, a YouTube channel where she talks about game design, and she blogs a few times a month at Gnome Stew. With the support of her patrons she recently released a game about Lesbisnakes in wintertime titled A Cozy Den. You can find all her work at her website.  \n[Unlocked] $21,500 CAD - Scout Sector Archive by Johnstone Metzger\nAfter this stretch goal is unlocked, Johnstone will write a Sector Archive for crews that fly the Scout flag.

The game is complete, the mechanics are final and have been playtested thoroughly. It is a working playable roleplaying game. It has been fully written and is undergoing minor tweaks and revisions for clarity and simplicity. It is in the editing and art phase pre-layout. There is a risk with me doing the layout, but I have several layout artists in the wings that could come to the rescue. \n\nThe Sector Archive relies on work from other designers, all of which have experience delivering Kickstarter stretch goals, self publishing, and even successfully completing their own Kickstarters. \n\nFriesens has a long history of printing quality work, but there could also be some delays, but these should be minor.\n\nShipping can always be problematic, which is why we'll be using Backerkit and/or, if we print a offset run, Indie Press Revolution to deal with fulfillment.

It has never been published and almost disappeared from history after the war, but we are now restoring the pages of one of the most important documents of WW2. \nThe original 112 pages contained thorough information about everything from tidal forces to typical battle tactics and had the absolute highest security stamp during WW2: Top Secret Bigot - above Top Secret.\nIt described the German defenses and typical strongpoints, the risk of chemical attacks and was so thorough it even had an analysis of the soil type on Utah and Omaha Beach.\nThe book will contain a one-to-one copy of the original Monograph, new historical context and rare photos to explore. \nin total app 250 pages in hardcover including the original Monograph, added historical context and rare photos.\nWe will restore every single page from 1944 to its original look as it was presented in the Neptune Monograph. \nThe original Monograph will run on the right page throughout the book. Here you get a rare insight into the depth of the incredible intelligence work and literally cast your eyes on the same pages, that the allied command got in their hand for the first time six weeks before D-Day.\nOriginally the left pages were blank. Here commanders could add their notes and latest updates. We have decided to use this space to give a deeper understanding of the Monograph and add historical context and rare photos on the left pages of the book to explore and get the full picture of how the information was collected.\nThe Neptune Monograph was split into nine sections giving a deep and rare insight into the situation in Normandy six weeks before D-Day. All nine chapters will be in the book. \nThe Monograph has more than 14 pages of charts, maps, and graphics showing predicted German troop movements, tidal charts, and graphics of the layout of typical German strongpoints in Normandy as well as charts of the naval threat from warships and mines. The maps, charts, and folios will be restored and be in the book in full color.\nStretch goals are set up to allow us to expand the book into a package complete with full-size maps and a very rare addendum. This is quite expensive, but we would love to add it to the Neptune Monograph (see below for more information about our stretch goals, and how you can help expand the scope of the project).\nHenrik Elling has worked for more than 15 years teaching history and as an Editor in Chief at Scandinavia's best selling history- and science magazines.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

For continuing updates on Call to Adventure, visit BrotherwiseGames.com and our Facebook page!\nCall to Adventure is a tabletop game in which players compete to craft the hero with the greatest destiny. Play cards to build your character, cast runes to face challenges, and choose whether to follow a path of heroism or villainy. The core game mode is a 2-4 player competitive game, but Call to Adventure can also be played solo or cooperatively!\nCall to Adventure was created by Brotherwise Games, designers of the hit game Boss Monster. Our goal: design a game based on character-driven fantasy novels and RPGs. In Call to Adventure, facing a childhood rival or meeting your true love can be as important as slaying a dragon.\nAnd as part of this Kickstarter, we're thrilled to announce collaborations with two New York Times bestselling authors, Patrick Rothfuss and Brandon Sanderson. The very first expansion to the game -- available as a pledge level within this campaign -- will be set in the world of Rothfuss's The Name of the Wind. When this campaign reached $300,000 in funding, Brandon Sanderson announced that next year we will be releasing Call to Adventure: Stormlight.\nWhether you play in these fantasy worlds or create your own, Call to Adventure is a chance to create your own epic journey.\nChoose your path. Cast the runes. Achieve your destiny. Heed the...\nThe base game contains everything that 1-4 players need for unlimited hero crafting fun. Please note that the numbers above include all stretch goals unlocked over the course of the campaign (with the exception of the Kingkiller-exclusive \"Path of the Adem\" stretch goal). Higher pledge levels bring meaningful improvements to your game:\nPlease note that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign, but in some countries we can support Add-Ons through Kickstarter. Scroll to the bottom of this page for more information on Add-Ons.\nThe default \"world\" of Call to Adventure is classic fantasy, inspired by traditional tropes of sword-and-sorcery storytelling. But as huge fans of fantasy fiction, we dreamed of bringing Call to Adventure to established fantasy settings.\nBrotherwise Games is thrilled to announce that our first expansion will be set in the world of Patrick Rothfuss's best-selling Kingkiller Chronicles series. This expansion, and others to follow, will add new Challenges, new Destinies, and unique mechanics unique to the author's world.\nThe Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear are two of the most critically-acclaimed fantasy novels ever written, and we couldn't be more excited to bring their characters and themes to this expansion. Fans of the books will love this expansion, but anyone can enjoy it. Most of the cards feature Heroic Fantasy themes that can be brought into any fantasy world. And by backing this Kickstarter, you get the exclusive \"Path of the Adem\" Origin, Motivation, and Destiny cards!\nCall to Adventure is a game about choices. Do you begin as a Peasant or a Noble? Do you train your Strength or seek out Wisdom? Do you follow the path of a Hero or Antihero? Will your backstory ultimately be tragic or triumphant?\nOn every step of your hero's journey, you'll have to choose between immediate rewards and long-term potential. Do you push your luck and face a daunting Challenge now, or build your Abilities until you're truly ready?\nIt all starts with the first cards you'll see in the game: your Origin, Motivation, and Destiny:\nEach player is dealt two of each card type, giving you the chance to begin crafting your hero right away. The three cards you choose become your hero's Story, and most other cards you gain will be tucked under these initial Story cards. By the end of the game, after your hero has faced a host of challenges, your Story could look something like this:\nUnlike a standard die-roller, Call to Adventure relies on Runes to see if the fates are smiling on your efforts. The three core runes can be used for all challenges. You can also add any relevant Ability runes you've gained, and can choose whether to risk Corruption by casting dark runes.\nEvery icon visible in your Story is important. They reflect your heroic capabilities and contribute to your final Destiny score:\nEvery turn, you may attempt to add one card to your Story. For example, to gain a Trait, you must simply meet its prerequisite:\nChallenges, on the other hand, require you to push your luck and cast the runes to see if you succeed. Challenges are also another example of Call to Adventure's emphasis on choices. Every Challenge has two \"paths.\" The path you choose determines the reward you gain if you're successful.\nThe game doesn't end there! Hero cards can help you on the path to glory, while Antihero cards can make the most of an angst-ridden path. Experience tokens, gained when you fail a Challenge, can be spent to fuel card abilities. Engine building, set collection, and cross-table play are all part of the Call to Adventure experience!\nFor more on the game itself, we have posted a gameplay video. You can also download the rulebook or watch this How to Play video from The Rules Girl:\nThis campaign has unlocked every one of its stretch goals! With over 50 cards, two new play modes, and multiple component upgrades, this campaign has succeeded in seriously enhancing your Call to Adventure experience. Every stretch goal is available at the base game pledge level (and already included in the card counts above), with the exception of the \"Path of the Adem\" (which will be shipped with the Name of the Wind expansion early next year).\nAdd-Ons are only available to backers in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. If you wish to Add On one of the items above, please increase your pledge by that amount, and then specify your desired item in the post-campaign Kickstarter survey. Backers in the EU, Canada and Australia should add an addition $5 per item in shipping costs when calculating Add-Ons.\nBrotherwise is partnering with Kickstarter veterans, Quartermaster Logistics, to make U.S. and international fulfillment as affordable and effective as possible for all our backers.\nU.S. domestic shipping is included in your pledge, and the same amount subsidized for International shipping charges. Thanks to Quartermaster's worldwide fulfillment network, we'll be offering Canada, Europe, and Australia-friendly shipping, so that your costs are considerably reduced and VAT costs are covered.\nThe table below details your additional international shipping costs:\nRetailer Pledge Level\nGame and hobby retailers have been the heart of Brotherwise\u2019s success as a small publisher. With the goal of continuing that productive partnership, Brotherwise provides a retailer pledge option for brick and mortar game store owners excited to carry Call to Adventure. Terms are as follows: \nYou must be a brick-and-mortar retailer with a shipping address in the US, Canada, the EU, or Australia. It is okay if your store is outside those regions as long as you have a freight forwarder or similar service with an address within one of those regions. If you have a question as to whether or not you qualify, please contact us at bwisegames@gmail.com. \nYou may only purchase one complete carton of 5 base games. Because of the more distant launch date, The Name of the Wind expansion is not available for the retailer pledge, nor are the playmat or sleeves. However, all stretch goals will be included with your 5 copies of the game. \nThe pledge level amount is set at 50% of MSRP. Brotherwise will cover all shipping.

One team, the villains, are trying to take over the world with their their doomsday devices. The other team, the spies, are infiltrating the villains' secret lair to stop them. The spies must use their stealth and cunning to shut the villains down without getting caught. The villains must use their deductive reasoning and massive stockpile of weapons to prevent the spies' subversion. 2-4 players, ages 10+, 60-90 minutes\nCompletely asymmetric - each team plays completely differently. Will you be sneaky or discerning, cunning or explosive!?\nWork as a team - You won't make it far on your own. Players must coordinate with their teammate if they hope to be successful.\nHidden movement - Both sides move in secret, making the spies harder to hit, but they never know when a flamethrower is just around the next corner\nStrategic gameplay - Through the unique programming mechanics of the game, both teams must prioritize when to bunker down and expand their abilities, and when to sprint out and hope for a victory.\nMultiple powers to explore - Each character has multiple abilities to unlock, making every game a completely unique experience\nSet in the Burgle Bros universe - Some of your favorite safecrackers have been called in to save the world.\nNote from the Designer, Tim Fowers:  Sabotage is not for everyone. Unlike my past games, Sabotage is a head-to-head battle with a high learning curve. It has been a passion project for a long time - trying to capture the sublime gameplay of \"Spies vs Mercs\" mode of Splinter Cell, but in a boardgame. It is tricky at first, because of the unique mix of mechanics, but it's not too heavy after a game or two (my kids play with me).  I strongly encourage players to try the intro game, before unlocking all the gadgets (available free as intro Print and Play here). Sabotage has layers of delicious mind games that dedicated players will discover as they master the tools the game provides.\nSabotage is a tense and strategic cat-and-mouse game for two teams. Each team has their own copy of the 4x4 grid map, separated by a divider. Four dice are rolled each round, and all players program their moves simultaneously by spending those dice.\nThe Villains execute their programmed moves first, followed by the Spies. When Spies take a move action, they must announce some information about their location to the Villains. They use this to deduce and track the Spies. Both sides have the ability to unlock new tools and get access to more dice each round.\nThe Spies are trying to hack 8 times before the Villains hit them 5 times with their weapons.\nFor a brief overview, watch the video below:\nHere is video of how to play with the advance abilities.\n Each round, one player rolls the dice, and all players copy those numbers.\n Then everyone programs their actions using 2 of the 4 dice.\n Each time Spies move, they have to reveal one piece of information.\nFor a more complete understanding of the rules, check out the rulebook here.\nHere is an advanced game playthrough:\nSabotage brings back some of your favorite Burgle Bros characters - but with a whole new look!\nWe are also introducing a new cast of evil villains to go toe-to-toe with the Burgle team, all illustrated by Ryan Goldsberry.\n                                                                                                                           For this project we're not making stretch goals.  We have a bunch of timed unlocks coming every few days that will make the game even better.  Also there are no kickstarter exclusives or expansions.  No shenanigans.  This is just the lowest price there will be for the game. It will not be in distribution, but will be at some retailers.\nHow are we making it even better? The first Fowers game with miniatures:\nThe game will include miniatures of all the characters.  And because of the divider, both teams need a copy of each mini, so we're making a second set.\nDon't have four players?  We also have a mobile app that you can play against!  Grab a friend and go up against some computer controlled villains.  Your side plays just like the normal game with the board, cards, etc.  All you do is input what you would normally announce to the other team.  It also will generate new maps each game.\nABOUT THE CREATORS\nTim Fowers is the designer of many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, Paperback, and more. He is excited to be teaming up with Jeff Krause, the programmer responsible for the Burgle Bros and Hardback apps, along with Ryan Goldsberry, the illustrator behind all of Tim's games.\nWHY PLEDGE NOW\nHelp guide the development of this game. We listen to our backers and strive to implement their clever ideas.\nBackers receive the game at a discount compared to after the campaign.\nThis game is not going to distributors.

Her first and most prominent work, Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color, first published in 1901, provides a comprehensive overview of the main ideas of color theory at the time, as well as her wildly original and artistic approaches to color analysis and interaction. Through a 21st century lens, she appears to stumble upon midcentury design and minimalism decades prior to those movements. \nShe was a visionary color theorist whose methods were later adopted by men and became ubiquitous in design curriculums around the world. She was an incredible artist and creative champion whose pioneering work is conspicuously absent in nearly all history books. We aim to change that with this new presentation of her seminal work. In addition to presenting the original book in an accessible softcover, we are offering a beautifully bound hardcover edition exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. This deluxe facsimile version will not be made available again.\nEmily Noyes Vanderpoel at home (courtesy Litchfield Historical Society)\nHer remarkable inventiveness shines in a series of gridded squares, each 10 x 10, that analyze the proportions of color derived from actual objects, many of which were in Vanderpoel's vast collection of ceramics and antiques. She leaves her process relatively mysterious but what is clear, as historian and science blogger John Ptak\u202fnotes, is that Vanderpoel \u201csought not so much to analyze the components of color itself, but rather to quantify the overall interpretative effect of color on the imagination\u201d. Her square format predates Josef Albers\u2019\u202ficonic Homage to the Square\u202fby some fifty years.\nA Selection of Color Analysis Plates\nThis incredible book has long languished in antiquarian book markets.  Original copies trade hands for more than $500 and it has never received its proper audience. \u202fWe aim to change that, and with this new edition have taken meticulous measures to reproduce the original artifact at an affordable price. Largely disserved by the public domain, this vast 400 page book has been reproduced in recent years by shoddy print-on-demand services, from academically held PDFs and most tragically, only in black and white. Working with the Historical Society that Emily Noyes Vanderpoel helped establish, we are the first to invest the time, money, and love it takes to replicate this brilliant collection of color studies accurately. Using the most current digital methods and archival printing production, we aim to finally do justice to Vanderpoel\u2019s forgotten legacy as visionary and pioneer.\nWe will also be contributing an introduction written by design scholar Alan P. Bruton, who has been researching Vanderpoel and her work for decades. This introduction will serve to reflect on her incredible body of work from the vantage point of 21st century art history and women's movements, helping to illustrate that Vanderpoel remains one of the most important, underrated, and contemporarily relevant artists of her time and of the last century.\n\"Thoroughly conversant with the best scientific research of her day, Emily Noyes Vanderpoel brings an artist\u2019s eye and designer\u2019s sensibility to her prescient study of color. From embroidery and Persian rugs to ceramics and painting, her perceptive analysis reveals what was long hiding in plain sight. The remarkable illustrations are actually works of art that not only anticipate but actually compete with the best work of some of the most important twentieth-century artists.\"\nMark C. Taylor\nColumbia University\n\"Vanderpoel\u2019s delightfully inscrutable work is an artifact from out of time: abstract modernism born of the Victorian need to classify everything\u2014even the mundane. This book inspired me, and deserves this beautiful new treatment in print.\"\nLiza Daly  Author and creator of the Vanderbot \n\"This re-edition of Emily Noyes Vanderpoel's 1901 Color Problems is a fantastic addition to the library of literature that celebrates the wonders of visual experience. The writing is elegant, the information profound. How can we resist a book that opens with an exegesis on various elements of color in nature and on bird songs and Beethoven and declares \"We may aptly term color the music of light\"? The book is both a celebration and a lucid guide: to issues of luminosity and color temperature, and of harmony as well as contrast. And it is a compact dynamo of the history of color theory up to the time of Vanderpoel's writing. The many color plates are magnificent, both in the pleasures they provide and the magic they demonstrate; I feel safe in saying that Josef Albers would have been gobsmacked by this glorious volume.\"\nNicholas Fox Weber\nThe Josef and Anni Albers Foundation\nIn order to produce the beautiful objects you will receive as a backer at such an accessible price we need funds for printing and binding a large run. We aim to print at least 1000 copies, and our goal reflects the production costs for this amount, but the more pledges we get here the more we can print! As an established (although relatively young) publishing company we already have storage and distribution methods streamlined which will make for a seamless experience for our backers. \nWe also plan to spread the word of Vanderpoel's forgotten work as far and wide as we can. We need your help in righting this historical wrong. Tell your friends about Emily Noyes Vanderpoel! They will no doubt be as happy to discover her and her work as we have been. \nPDF - Each backer will receive a download of our high resolution color corrected PDF of the book. We poured months of work into this using the original book as a source. We are delighted to share this exclusive presentation with you!\nBookmark - This elegant handprinted bookmark comes with every copy of the book. It is printed in metallic gold ink on acid free paper.\nPreview of Bookmark\nSoftcover Book - This printing of Color Problems includes a thoughtful selection of paper stocks. Like the original, the text portion of our edition is printed on a soft uncoated natural stock. The 116 color plates are printed on a bright white coated paper stock to best display colors. The interiors will be offset printed with close attention to color reproduction. The book includes sewn signatures for long term durability and lay flat binding for ease of viewing. The cover is foil stamped and includes a vibrant slipover belly-band. We have taken careful measures to ensure all aspects of the production are of the highest quality.\nSoftcover version\nKickstarter Exclusive Hardcover Book - The deluxe cloth-bound Kickstarter Exclusive Edition comes with the same interiors bound into a deluxe foil embossed boards and an alternate belly-band. Like the original book, this Exclusive Edition includes a square compositional viewer and translucent filters tucked in the back. These filters allow the reader to interact with the art works and the world around them in a truly interactive way, and help illustrate some of Vanderpoel's most ingenious ideas about the perception of color. This Deluxe presentation of the book will only be available to backers of this campaign.\nExclusive Hardcover Version with Transluscent Films\nArtist Print - This beautiful 12\"x18\" Fine Art print of COLOR ANALYSIS FROM A BUTTERFLY is executed in-house at The Circadian Press.

Using specialty inks and 100% Cotton paper, these extremely limited editions will last for generations.\nWE HAVE REACHED OUR STRETCH GOAL!\nOne of our favorite details of the original Color Problems printing is the gold and silver metallic pantones that are included in several of the color analyses. You can see an example below of the use of these metallics and the special beauty it adds to the page. We have funded our stretch goal and now we can afford to include these pantones in every copy of the book that we make, both hard covers and soft covers!
