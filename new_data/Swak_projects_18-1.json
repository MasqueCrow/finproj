[{"backer": "Swak", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " FlipGrip attaches directly to the back of your phone or phone case and allows you to quickly and easily grip, rotate, stand, and mount your phone with the all new FlipMount.\n\n Gripping your phone with FlipGrip is quick and easy. Just flip out the flaps and insert your fingers into FlipGrip's patent pending \"X\" shaped design for a secure one handed grip.\n\nFlipGrip rotates 360 degrees so you can easily switch your phone from portrait to landscape mode.\n\n\n\n FlipGrip quickly turns into a handy kickstand so you can view your phone hands-free.\n\n\n FlipMount allows you to mount, adjust, and rotate your phone in your car or on any surface. FlipMount comes in a car-vent version and a multi-surface version that sticks to any flat surface via an adhesive pad. It also comes in white and black!\nFlipMount inserts into FlipGrip's center slots and locks onto a flange on the bottom of the grip. No magnets needed.\n\n\n FlipGrip's all plastic design is compatible with wireless charging, even with a thin case. For thick cases FlipGrip's top quickly pops off with a firm prying motion so you can still wirelessly charge. FlipGrip's bottom ring also works with Apple's new iPhone 12 MagSafe charger.\nFlipGrip has worked on every wireless charger we we have tested without a case.\nFlipGrip worked on most wireless chargers we tested with a thin case (<2mm thick). For charging with thicker cases and MagSafe, FlipGrip's top pops off with a firm prying motion to reveal it's thin bottom ring. It then easily snaps back on when finished charging.\n\n\n FlipGrip's patent pending \"X\" shaped design allows you to naturally and comfortably grip your phone unlike the uncomfortable squeezing motion required by other grips.\n\n\n FlipGrip is extremely secure. Dropping your phone becomes almost impossible when using FlipGrip.\n\n\nFlipGrip's thin and sleek design allows it slide more easily into your pocket than other bulky grips. FlipGrip is only 5mm thick and has beautifully tapered edges.\n\n\n\n You can choose one base color and one trim color per grip. Color selections will be made in the post-campaign survey.\n\n\n\n\n FlipGrip's bottom ring attaches to the back of your phone via an adhesive pad. FlipGrip's top then snaps on for use, and can be popped off using a firm prying motion.\n\n\n FlipGrip works with all phones and most phone cases. FlipGrip will come with a transparent sticker that will help it stick to phones with a glass back. FlipGrip will not stick to your phone case if it is heavily textured, flimsy, or made of fabric.\n\n\n\n\n Our estimated shipping costs are included in the spreadsheet below. These estimates are subject to change depending on the compaign's overall order volume. These charges may also change if you adjust your pledge amount in the post campaign survey.\n\n FlipGrip went through over 30 different versions during the prototyping and development stage. Some of the 3D printed iterations are shown below. After about 10 months of development, FlipGrip's design has been finalized. \nWe have partnered with ANDesign to help prepare FlipGrip and FlipMount for injection molding. ANDesign is a fully integrated product design firm with an abundance of experience in the development of mobile accessories.\nFlipGrip went through over 30 different versions in the prototyping and development stage. Here are some of the 3D printed prototype parts.\n\n\nFlipGrip is 55mm in diameter and 5mm thick.

Our goal is provide a balanced mixture of survival realism with the gameplay of a modern military shooter. A massive, open world with hardcore survival and combat elements, in depth environmental interaction, and terrifying, intelligent AI. Players will spawn into this world with nothing and will have to brave the environment to gather supplies while avoiding the fearsome AI and potentially even more deadly players. Your goal is carve out your own space in this hostile world and decide whether or not to take part in a war that is raging between the rival factions that have taken over the land. Surviving means making alliances and taking what you need from opposing factions, whether that be skills, resources, or their lives.\nDevelopment blogs and announcements\n            Breaking Point's roots stretch back to 2012 where it began as a mod on the Arma platform and saw a second iteration with the release of Arma 3. What was initially intended to be a straight port took on a life of its own and many of the game's core concepts and designs began to take shape. However, over the course of the next year it became clear that our ideas had outgrown the capabilities of the platform and without access to the Engine's source code, there was nothing we could do to solve this. Enter Unreal Engine 4, and with it the freedom to take Breaking Point where it needs to go.  \nA very important question given the somewhat crowded nature of the genre. \nOur dedication to creating a seamless blend of engaging gameplay mechanics and hardcore realism combined with our attention to detail and relentless drive to make things better; these are the qualities that set our team and our game apart.\nBreaking Point is being developed with a combined 15+ years of experience in both the survival MMO genre and the professional gaming industry as a whole. Experience from players, developers, broadcasters, and artists all geared towards realizing the full potential of this unique style of game.\nWe are partnering with a number of amazing and talented Broadcasters for this campaign! Our Partners so far:\nCohhCarnage\nJackFrags\nStodeh\nBikeMan\nFairlight_Excalibur\nBreaK\nAureylian\nEzekiel_III\nAnthony_Kongphan\nStrippin\nitmeJP\nGoldGlove\nSmaK\nMrMoonsHouse\nWish\nTowelliee\nDexbonus\nEatMyDiction1\nTimmac\nActaBunniFooFoo\nJonsandman\nDimitrisPhotos\nKatieRouu\nBurkeBlack\nThadrius\nTheRunningManZ\nPsiSyn\nFemSteph\nEllohime\nHalifax\nBragoonTV\nPydrex\nIf you are a content creator interested in teaming up with us to unlock exclusive in-game personalized content for you and your community, or if there are any streamers you love that you don't think are currently involved, you can tell them to reach out to: https://twitter.com/breakingpointg\nIn addition to our awesome partners above, we have also joined forces with Sacriel as a direct member of our Development Team! Sacriel serves as our Lead Game Designer and will be leveraging his years of experience in this genre to craft and balance our core game mechanics as well as introduce many innovative ideas of his own. Sacriel will also be working with our Creative Director to produce educational development videos to break down these designs.\nEach of these features will be expanded upon in future development videos detailing what they seek to accomplish, our design philosophy, and how they work in the Breaking Point world.\n  Choose your side...\nA long time feature of Breaking Point taken to an exciting new level. Seven unique factions secluded in Strongholds spread throughout the world encompassing a broad range of play styles and alignments. Carry out everything from item gathering quests to targeted assassinations to earn your way forward. Unique skill sets and resources are made available to you with increasing usefulness as you progress and you may even wish to augment your capabilities by working for the enemy, but do so only at your own risk.\n  ...and choose your armament...\nAnother hallmark of Breaking Point. An eclectic mix of modern and vintage weaponry is featured ranging from the simplest melee weapons to high powered hunting rifles, all heavily customizable. Projectile velocity, trajectory, object penetration, and power; all modeled to real world specifications for standard, hollow point, and over pressured rounds with the input of real world military personnel.\n  ...because the threat is real...\nIntelligent, nuanced, and highly dangerous; these are the characteristics that were previously impossible but are now well within our reach. Breaking Point's enemy AI will be a thrill for the PvE enthusiast while adding depth to PvP encounters. Enemies will include intelligent Hunters, massive Hordes, peculiar Scavengers, and extremely rare Predators that you'll wish you never saw. \n  ...and resources are scarce...\n Our solution to an age-old problem that has plagued survival games. Too much loot and your game loses the tense survival elements becomes a trigger-happy battle royal. Not enough loot and it is simply not fun! Our custom dynamic loot system was designed specifically to solve this problem and create a balanced loot economy to maintain both hardcore survival and exciting PvP without compromising either.\n    ...in this alluring and dangerous land...\nA beautifully vast landscape with a number of different environments to explore and lose yourself in. The Breaking Point map \u201cKepinaos\u201d is a fictional territory containing lush forests, soaring mountains, and arid deserts, not to mention countless secrets to uncover! Climb trees, scale cliffs, or venture deep underground; an all encompassing world awaits!\n  ...where you will fight to outlive...\nCompletely redesigned for the new Breaking Point universe! Our \u201ctreat to recover\u201d medical system is designed to fit into the Breaking Point survival world and will feature treatment ranging from herbalism and simple bandaging to full blown field surgery. But don\u2019t worry, the system is carefully balanced to serve and enhance both PvE and PvP gameplay, not get in the way of it.\n  ...and adapt to the change...\nA truly living world where the battle between mankind and the epidemic rages on all around you. Roaming hordes, vehicle crashes, AI skirmishes, and random dynamic encounters will keep you on your toes at all times. The world itself will also change over time with environment clutter, building interiors, and even buildings themselves changing over time to keep the world fresh and interesting. \n  ...or be crushed by the weight...\nYou can rely on us to keep your gameplay experience safe (from the things that aren\u2019t SUPPOSED to kill you anyway). Our commitment to staying one step ahead of scripters and hackers is unyielding. No mercy, no second chances.  \n...of those more cunning than you.\nWe understand that the modding community plays a very important role in the longevity and success of many games, especially in this genre. We have developed Breaking Point with this in mind. You will be able to add anything into the game (limited only by your skill with the Unreal Engine) and even host your own modded servers.\nTier Rewards FAQ\nWhat do the different \"tiers\" mean?\nEach Reward is part of a larger \"Tier\", and with each Tier the rewards increase. The Tiers in order are:\n- Fresh Spawn                                                                                       \n- Survivor                                                                                                    \n- Soldier\n- Veteran                                                                                                     \n- Warrior                                                                                                         \n- Paragon\nWith each Tier comes a new exclusive in-game item (where applicable). The higher Tiers DO receive the weapon and character skins from previous Tiers as well.\nHow will the various in-game items work?\nCharacter Patches - These will appear on ALL of your characters in the game in the form of a shoulder or chest patch with the applicable design or logo. \nWeapon Skins - These will appear on ALL weapons in the game and be available to you via an inventory UI when you pick up a weapon. \nCharacter Skins - These will appear ONLY on the primary \"Survivor\" character.\nWhat is the different between a Standard Steam Key and a Deluxe Steam Key? \nA Standard Steam Key grants the rewards to the backer only, regardless of the number of keys given as part of the reward. For example, the \"Power Backer - Veteran Tier\" level comes with 3 Standard Steam Keys. Only the one of these keys, the one granted to the backer, will come with the rewards of that level. However, ALL Standard Steam Keys above the \"Beta Backer\" level include Beta Access.\nA Deluxe Stream Key includes the rewards with ALL of the keys given. For example the \"Legion Group Backer - Warrior Tier\" includes 8 Deluxe Steam Keys, ALL 8 of these keys will have the rewards listed in this level. This is setup so that a squad or group of friends can all pitch in together to back a higher tier and each receive rewards on their own keys. There are 3 group options available:\n\n- Group Backer - Veteran Tier                                                       \n- Legion Group Backer - Warrior Tier                                                             \n- Baron Group Backer - Paragon Tier  \nWhat are the \"Survivor Logs\"?\nThese are audio tapes that can be discovered and listened to in a game. They can be recorded by backers of the applicable levels via any digital means they choose (phone, handheld recorder, studio etc.). Tell a horror story, send a message to friend or loved one, give a survival or combat tip, the choice is yours! All messages are subject to our approval but our only requirements are that it be thematically appropriate for a game of this genre and not contain any inappropriate, vulgar, or copywritten material such as music. \nHow does the \"custom designed building\" reward work?\nWe will work with you directly to design a custom building to be placed in game. This can be anything from a residential or commercial building to a shack in the woods, its up to you! All designs are subject to our approval but our only requirements are that it be thematically appropriate for a game of this genre, not be something exceptionally large or intricate such as a skyscraper or football stadium, and not contain any inappropriate, vulgar, or copywritten material such as trademarked logos or slogans.\nHow does the \"custom character likeness\" reward work?  \nWe will create a character in the game using your facial likeness. We will not use the likeness of any other person, real or fictional. We will ask for a high quality, straight on photo of your face with neutral lighting. DSLR camera preferred but a good quality cell phone picture is acceptable. The higher the quality, the more the character will look like you! All photos received are subject to our approval but our only requirements are that the photo is of acceptable quality and that an accompanying photo of you with valid identification is provided.       \nGeneral FAQ\nWhat platforms will Breaking Point be on? \nWindows / Linux + Steam OS.\nHow much will it cost upon final release? \n USD $30-35\nWhat does \"Beta\" release mean for me? \nBeta release will be the first opportunity for qualifying backers to play the full online version of Breaking Point. This phase will focus on optimization, gameplay mechanic balance, and overall polish. All of our \"Alpha\" phases will be closed for the purpose of strictly focusing on feature development and QA.\nHow many players per server? \nOur goal is a minimum of 100, but this number may be lower during the \"Beta\" phase while optimizations are taking place. \nCan I host my own servers?\nYes, Anyone can host a server. Servers run on both Windows / Linux.\nWhere can I purchase Breaking Point when released? \nSteam Store Page.\nWhen will Breaking Point be available? \nSummer 2018 with Beta Access for specific backers in the early Spring 2018.\nWill Breaking Point be avaliable on consoles? \n Not at this time.\nWill Breaking Point be first person or third person POV? \nBoth will be available and it will depend on the settings set by the server owner. \nWill any character or server information carry over from the Breaking Point mod? \nUnfortunately no, this is not possible with the change in game engine. \nWhere can I find out more information on Breaking Point?\nwww.playbreakingpoint.com\nWhy $300k USD ($403K AUD)?\nPlease see our Budget Breakdown below. Since we are NOT planning for an \"early access alpha\" release to help generate revenue, we require the funds to pay multiple salaries. All costs are based around paying a 1 year salary for each task e.g. \"Social Media Creation & Management\" involves creating, managing, and maintaining all of our social media channels (Facebook, Twitter, Youtube etc) from Kickstarter completion to full release.\n  MINIMUM:  (Estimated)\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit or later (64 Bit ONLY)  \nProcessor: Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 2.5 GHz or faster.\nMemory: 6 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD Radeon R9 280X series card or higher.  \nDirectX: Version 10 Additional Notes: This game needs a dedicated graphics card to run. It will struggle to run on laptops, notebooks etc.\nRECOMMENDED:  (Estimated)\nOS: Windows 10 64 Bit Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD processor, 3.5 GHz or faster.  \nMemory: 8 GB RAM Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 series card or higher.  \nDirectX: Version 11 Additional Notes: Experimental Direct X 12 Supported with Windows 10.

Card must be Open GL 4 Compatible\nNote: Vulkan is Supported with launch argument -vulkan.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a small indie team we have a few core challenges:\n\n1) Performance. This is a challenge for any team big or small in this genre of game. A combination of extremely accurate player position and lag-free client and server performance is our goal which we hope to achieve with the following: \n\n - Extensive material optimization\n - Multithreaded Asymmetric Loading\n - Cutting edge Middleware\n - Detailed analytics\n\nWe hope to achieve the desired performance at or immediately following launch but this cannot be guaranteed as there are hundreds of factors that will go into making Breaking Point run seamlessly. Thankfully the Unreal Engine contains powerful graphing and analytics that we will utilize to track performance and narrow in on problem areas quickly. As one example, we will be able to track the client-side FPS of each individual player and aggregate the data to track the overall health of the game. We will publish this data on our website so you, the player, can track the overall performance of the game as well and measure against your in-game experiences.\n\n2) Finances. Game development is expensive, especially when you choose to forgo the \"early access alpha\" route. We have access to alternative funding sources in the event that unforeseen problems cause the Beta and/or full game release to be delayed and thus extend us beyond the budget detailed above. We are committed to the full release of Breaking Point at any cost. \n\n3) Team size. As a small team we are heavily reliant on the multi talented nature of the core individuals as opposed to the brute force of an entire department of employees. This will make large scale development more stressful than it already is, however the aforementioned core has a 5 year history of working together with the Lead Developer having already developed and launched a successful game on the Unreal Engine.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Alderon Games Pty Ltd\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nM.Cassells - Lead Developer - 7 years Multiplayer Game Development Experience - C++, C#, PHP, MySQL, Python, Focus on Networking and...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 7 or more", "title": "Contributor - Fresh Spawn Tier", "descp": "**~$5 USD**\nThank you for supporting Breaking Point!\n+ Name in game credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["32 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 40 or more", "title": "Core Backer - Survivor Tier", "descp": "**~$30 USD**\n+ 1 digital copy of the game (Standard Steam Key)\n+ 'Survivor' Tier in-game clothing patch and forum tag\n+ Name in game credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 53 or more", "title": "Beta Backer - Soldier Tier", "descp": "**~$40 USD**\n+ 1 digital copy of the game (Standard Steam Key)\n+ Beta access\n+ 'Soldier' Tier in-game clothing patch and forum tag\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's Original Soundtrack\n+ Name in game credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}], "stat": ["572 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 80 or more", "title": "Pro Backer - Veteran Tier", "descp": "**~$60 USD**\n+ 1 digital copy of the game (Standard Steam Key)\n+ Beta access\n+ 'Veteran' Tier in-game character skin\n+ 'Veteran' Tier in-game clothing patch and forum tag\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's in-game Handbook\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's Original Soundtrack\n+ Name in game credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}], "stat": ["300 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 133 or more", "title": "Legacy Backer - Veteran Tier", "descp": "**~$100 USD**\n+ 1 digital copy of the game (Standard Steam Key)\n+ Beta access\n+ Record your own personal survivor log to be used in game\n+ 'Veteran' Tier in-game character skin\n+ 'Veteran' Tier in-game clothing patch and forum tag\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's in-game Handbook\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's Original Soundtrack\n+ Name in game credits\n* The 'Legacy Backer' reward is only available for the first 100 backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}], "stat": ["99 backers", "Limited (1 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 133 or more", "title": "Group Backer - Veteran Tier", "descp": "**~$100 USD**\n+ 3 digital copies of the game (Deluxe Steam Keys, all keys include rewards below)\n+ Beta access\n+ 'Veteran' Tier in-game character skin\n+ 'Veteran' Tier in-game clothing patch and forum tag\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's in-game Handbook\n+ Digital copy of Breaking Point's Original Soundtrack\n+ Name in game credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}], "stat": ["132 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 133 or more", "title": "Legacy Backer - Veteran Tier", "descp": "**~$100 USD**\nMore audio logs!

We need your support to release it by the end of 2016!\nThe game tells the story of eight people whose everyday lives are forever changed after a horrific plane crash. They now find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere, deep in the forests of Alaska. Welcome to a world without civilization, where you and the other survivors are at the mercy of nature \u2014 and wild animals starved by the cold!\nWhile the survivors await rescue, their lives are threatened by a number of mysterious entities, unseen creatures and objects that definitely don\u2019t belong in this world. And the deeper you go, the harder it gets to survive. Through the storyline you\u2019ll desperately try to reach help on the radio, but no one\u2019ll answer you. Something is wrong here. In here is no room for mistakes: if you went hunting but forgot to cut some wood for the fire before nightfall, you\u2019re dead. If you didn\u2019t have time to cook your meat, you might have to eat it raw \u2014 and if you don\u2019t have medicine, you\u2019ll surely die from food poisoning. To stay alive, you\u2019ll need to scavenge and craft like a pro.\nYou can play The Wild Eight on your own, but the game fully opens up in co-op mode. Other players are your only backup \u2014 either by sharing resources or covering your back! Even if you were mauled by wolves and \"you died\" appears onscreen, your teammate can still resuscitate you with a defibrillator (which are very rare to find, by the way).\nRelease Date: December 2016 (Steam) \nLanguages: English, Spanish, German, French, Russian, Japanese\nPlatforms: Windows, Linux, Mac, Xbox One, PlayStation 4\nWebsite: thewildeight.com\n A Mysterious World Outside Time and Space\nThe game world is a little like a chessboard. It\u2019s made out of tiles, and each of them is unique. At the start of the game, every tile is used to randomly generate a new world and distinct locations for each quest.\nTime here moves fast: Temperature drops as it gets darker (you\u2019ll need a bonfire!), and you\u2019ll also need to secure some food if you intend to survive until morning. Weather varies from sunny to severe storms, with duration and intensity randomly decided by the game engine.\nAre They All Friends?\nSurvive and explore the forest side by side with other players or go solo. Cooperation is the right way to face this harsh world \u2014 that is, until a psycho is revealed to be part of the group! Will he or she go for the prize... or taste human flesh?\nSurvival is Not a Given\nDeath is at every corner \u2014 especially hunger and cold. Make sure to secure a constant supply of food by hunting or gathering, and spend time to cook it so that you stay healthy and warm.\nNew Skills = Better Chances\nLeveling up is represented by linear categories, which are divided by related quests. Just as in real life, if someone suddenly turns away from civilization, he or she has to start by learning the basics: how to make a fire, how to navigate the woods, and how to craft armor, spears, bows \u2014 along with more sophisticated tools and weapons.\nCrafting is the Only Way to Stay Alive\nThere are two types of crafting: on the go, and at the workshop. You can build base equipment like flares or basic weapons on the go. At the workshop, you have more resources: it is now possible to create and upgrade complicated objects such as custom backpacks, traps, bandages, and lots of other useful trinkets.\nMotivation\nThe game\u2019s plot is divided into a main campaign and additional quests. You can finish the game without completing a single side quest; however, side quests are essential if you want to have a shot at a happy ending. \nWe\u2019ll split the story into three; each one will be associated with the current location. When the location of the main story is initially generated, the location of all side quests will be randomly defined \u2014 placing key events in locations equally distant from one another.\nYour Choice: Killing Vs. Running\nThe game features two types of creatures: passive and aggressive. Passive are animals that don\u2019t want to harm you. These are the easiest to hunt for: rabbits, deer, wild boars, etc. Passive behavior can also differ; for example, rabbits run away when you approach, while boars always try to fight back.\nAggressive animals can and will kill you in a head-to-head scramble. You\u2019ll need to run or kill them with a good weapon. Keep in mind that even one bite might ruin everything; you\u2019ll start to bleed immediately and there is only one chance to stay alive: bandaging yourself.\nThe soundtrack plays a key role in conveying the emotional undertones of the game to players. We are currently working on the main theme, which you'll hear during gameplay at different times.\nHere are a couple of tracks hosted on Soundcloud:\nA vertical layering interactive music system maximizes player immersion in The Wild Eight. Music will be composed of different layers, which can be switched on and off depending on what\u2019s taking place in-game.\nIn August 2015, we were about to make a racing game with guns (like Twisted Metal), but we decided that it would be best to make a game based on life itself. Our life, that is \u2014 something that we remember from childhood. So in September, we assembled a team of eight people. Each of us had previous experience in game development, so we knew what to do and what it took to ship a game. We were ready to work late, get almost no sleep, work on weekends \u2014 and fully devote ourselves to the game. \nBy the end of 2015, we came up with the core gameplay loop and made it into a a small demo with all the necessary design elements and 3D models. We spent all of January getting ready for the first announcement, which took place on February 11th. Today we have already reached alpha. We're now working on multiplayer, quests, animations, and more \u2014 which is why we need your help!\nThe Wild Eight will be released for Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The exact release schedule will depend on the success of this Kickstarter campaign \u2014 and more specifically, on the stretch goals. We will need to significantly expand our resources and budget in order to ensure a \u201cday one\u201d release on all platforms.\nWe have been developing The Wild Eight for half a year. We\u2019ve all made financial sacrifices to get it this far. To finish it, we\u2019ll need your help! We are planning to release the game on PC, Mac and Linux by December 2016. Console versions will follow based on the studio\u2019s resources and the overall performance of the Kickstarter campaign. If we have a big success on our hands and our stretch goals are met, we will do everything we can to deliver a day-and-date release on all major console platforms along with PC, Mac and Linux.\nIn order to finish The Wild Eight, we\u2019ll need to grow our team. Accordingly, most of our budget will go to salaries, office expenses, and outsourcing sound and quality assurance/testing. \n8 Points was founded in 2015. We\u2019re all from different studios, where many of us had been working on casual games. We quickly realized our passion was not with casual titles, but for deeply immersive experiences \u2014 which led the team to The Wild Eight!\nPretending to be rock stars in front of the famous Lena Pillars\nOur team consists of 9 developers: 4 programmers, 3 artists, CEO, and CMO. We live in one of the strangest and coldest places on Earth: It\u2019s called Yakutia, where people eat bears for breakfast, develop games for lunch, and gather firewood for dinner \u2014 because electricity is too expensive. Who else would know anything about surviving in the wild if not us?\nSteam-key or digital copy of the game for Xbox One/PS4. \nDigital soundtrack pack consisting of 10 high-quality tracks from the game. \nGather an access for Beta & Alpha versions of the game (Steam only). Be the first to try the latest build straight from the developers.\nSurvivor bracelet with The Wild Eight logo made of metal & tough rope.

One of the good ones. It\u2019s got many components of a standout game - stylish graphics, captivating atmosphere, a compelling narrative hook, mysteries that beg to be investigated, and heavy consequences for player choices. I don\u2019t play games often anymore, but this is one of the few that has my mouth watering.\u201d\n\u2013 Zach Hanks, Voice Actor & Director\nWhether you\u2019ve backed us or not, we want to sincerely thank you your interest in our project.

Originally released in 2003 by Fleer as Ophidian 2350, a company best known for its sports cards and bubble gum, the game found itself treading water in a market flooded with other new card games. Since its release Ophidian has stood apart by offering players an unusually high number of strategic options during gameplay. Unfortunately, its publisher went out of business shortly after the game's release, and all of Fleer's assets were either sold off or destroyed.

The game is more action-focused than ours, and should allow for some great, fast-paced gameplay that\u2019ll stand alongside Star Citizen, No Man\u2019s Sky, Elite and all the others!\u201d\nThere are fantastic and vast space sims out there featuring super realistic space physics and billions of stars to travel to. But we believe that combining easy-to-pick-up gameplay with AAA-quality graphics and sound with a captivating, non-linear story is something that many of you have still been waiting for. We have been for sure and also Brian Fargo - Chief Creator of Bard's Tale 1 - 4, Wasteland 1&2 and Torment likes EVERSPACE\u2122: \"The visuals in EVERSPACE\u2122 look spectacular and I liked everything the developer had to say. Proudly backed!\"\nIn EVERSPACE\u2122 we take a more action-focused approach to the core gameplay of a space shooter and combine it with a modern, rogue-like game loop taking you on a challenging journey through an ever-changing, yet beautifully crafted universe full of surprises.\nEach run will be exciting as you will have to face completely new situations. Your skills, experience and talent for improvisation will be tested continously. By this we keep each part of the game long-lasting and generate lots of individual, meaningful moments for you to experience.\n\nFeedback from the community.\n... FULL OF SURPRISES\nThe goal of the game may sound simple: Reach your destination. However, with every new attempt you will face all new challenges as the route to your destination and the obstacles you must overcome vary each time you play.\nWhen you start a run, a new course to your destination will be plotted so that it is very unlikely that you will encounter the same setting twice. To survive you will have to adapt to the circumstances at hand:\nUse different tactics when dealing with enemies - cloak your ship and sneak past or attack all guns blazing?\nGather resources for much needed repairs in the local asteroid belt or hunt down well-guarded traders for their precious supplies?\nExplore the mysterious nebula visible in the distance with unknown consequences or stay safe and head straight to the space station for refueling?\nInvestigate cosmic anomalies and stellar bodies (wormholes, comets, derelict ship wrecks) or don't bother and jump to the next system?\nObviously as an EVERSPACE\u2122 pilot you need to deal with lots of decisions during your journey. Each and every one will affect how you experience your personal quest to the ultimate goal. Because of this no EVERSPACE\u2122 run is like any other. Ever.\nIn order to leave the system and jump to the next one, you will need to gather enough fuel to power up the jump drive and at the same time collect credits and resources to craft items and upgrade your ship.\nThe mix of persistent progression (blueprints and personal wealth) and temporary progression (crafting and equipping your ship during a run) combined with an ever-changing universe and a rewarding story will make you want to start over again and again to eventually reach your final destination.\nCore game loop.\nWe won't make EVERSPACE\u2122 ultra hardcore and unforgiving. Rather, every time you die you will be able to improve your starting conditions for all the following runs. Permanently increase the capacity of your shields, install better engines, improve sensors, upgrade weapons, and attach armor plates - just to name a few.\nMost ship upgrades will be directly visible, while some will have a huge visual impact, e.g. upgrading your wings will lead to an entirely different look.\nYou will be able to dig into the depths of the upgrade tree. Think of perks and upgrades that can change a lot of things - unlock new abilities and equipment, improve various stats and enable several other benefits that may change your play style.\nFurthermore, every death will get you closer to revealing another fragment of the story being told. So dying is part of the progression.\n ... TO COMPLETE YOUR EPIC SPACE ADVENTURE\nTypically, due to the nature of the genre, rogue-likes don't have a deep story. We think the genre is just perfect to tell a captivating story in a fresh, non-linear way that unfolds differently every time you pick up the game. So we came up with an engaging plot that makes perfect sense for you to be re-born after every death and come back with a deeper knowledge of what is actually going on and, ultimately, solving the great puzzle. On this we have been working together with Falko L\u00f6ffler who has been a successful story and game writer for adventure games for many years.\nExemplary player journey.\nThis will be the first rogue-like space game that brings high production values of this caliber and a deep, captivating story told in an innovative way to your PC.\nConcept art for a hangar.\n... PAIRED WITH SPOT-ON CONTROLS\nFor us, fun and playability come first and have to fit the type of game. EVERSPACE\u2122 will not be a space simulation. Arcady controls will test your skills and reflexes without the burden of crazy speeds up to 40,000 km/h, inertia, thrust and anti-thrust.\nThe controls will be intuitive and optimized for mouse and keyboard in the first place. In fact, we put a lot of effort into this and we believe EVERSPACE\u2122 has one of the best control schemes since Freelancer. We will support gamepads and joysticks if you unlock the respective stretch goal as it is a lot of work to nail that, too. In any case, no matter what hardware you will be using EVERSPACE\u2122 will be easy-to-pick-up and play.\nSpeaking of physics, we had lots of fun in playing around with PhysX in UE4 and we will implement some cool gameplay features based on that: Using mining lasers will enable you to slice up asteroids to extract valuable resources inside. See it in action:\nSpace is a dangerous place and so are most of your encounters. Though you may come across some gentlebeings who will employ you on special missions or sell useful equipment, the majority of NPCs will try to kill you - and they might do so in a variety of ways:\nImagine a group of pirates launching from the hangar of a destructible outpost, breaking formation and trying to attack you from different vectors while their chief is giving the orders from a bulky war vessel and firing missiles at you from a safe distance!\nImagine your ship attacking a frigate which is using different defensive patterns and has multiple destroyable turrets and weak spots that can render the whole ship inoperable when critically hit!\nImagine scavengers, traversing the system in search of easy prey or uncloaking right behind you!\nImagine organic life forms lurking in asteroid fields surrounded by a dense plasma cloud only waiting to jump at the next target moving into their domain!\nImagine Kamikaze fighters ramming their ship into yours when their hull integrity is low\n\nConcept art for a gunship.\nConcept art for a scout.\nVarious enemy concepts.\nThe condition of your ship will be more than just a health bar. Damage to the equipment will have noticeable effects on your vessel's performance and needs to be repaired using valuable resources. The type and severity of damage will influence your decision on what to repair first if resources are scarce. This will put you into challenging situations where you have to live with the damage or repair it with resources that you otherwise could spend on crafting new weapons or devices.\n\nDuring a run you can craft weapons, ammunition and devices that improve stats or offer whole new gameplay possibilities. Crafting is easy: you will need a blueprint and required resources and you are good to go:\nMaybe you are stranded in a desolate asteroid field; craft a mining rocket to extract fuel out of certain asteroids that will allow you to power up your jump drive and leave the place.\nCraft a cloaking device or an afterburner to fly past an overly powerful band of warships.\nCraft an extension to your laser weapon that enables the shield bypass feature.\nWhatever you do: Crafting the most suitable item at the right time will greatly increase your chance of survival.\nUsing Unreal Engine 4 and the latest technology in visuals and audio, EVERSPACE\u2122 will blow you away. From vast space environments to highly detailed ships and spectacular particle effects - you will be surrounded by magic.\nWe are creating a mesmerizing vision of space that will leave you in awe. There is only so much realistic space simulation one can take before sinking into depression so consider EVERSPACE\u2122 your Prozac. Happy time!\nUnreal Engine 4 allows us to go full \"da Vinci\" on the graphics with all the latest DirectX 11 & 12 features, including full-scale dynamic lighting, reflections, tessellation and much more.\nWith GPU powered particles we can render millions of dynamic sparks, bits and pieces at a time like there is no tomorrow. Advanced post effects, such as colour grading, eye adaptation, lens flares and screen space reflections will top it off. All of these give us the ability to realize our vision and make EVERSPACE\u2122 the kind of experience that makes you go \"Whoah!\"\nAgain, we are not creating a simulation here. Our top priority is to make it look and sound awesome! Oh, you say there cannot be sound in space? Don't tell that to our sound director who has created every sound effect with great dedication and passion in Dolby Surround 5.1.\nMOBILE IS OUR PAST - PC AND CONSOLE ARE OUR FUTURE\nROCKFISH Games is a studio founded by Michael Schade and Christian Lohr who previously founded and have run FISHLABS Entertainment for almost ten years. Pretty much the whole team who created the Galaxy on Fire series has joined and we are super happy that we got the band back together \u2013 YEAH!\nIf you are a PC or console only player you may not have heard of us before, but we take pride in having built one of the very best mobile games studios in the world with dozens of console-style 3D mobile titles with millions of happy players around the globe.\nWe have won numerous awards for our games and in 2011 became \"Best German Games Studio\" based on our pioneer work and consistent performance in 3D mobile gaming.\nWhile our heritage is AAA mobile gaming we are super excited about PC and console games. Equipped with the unlimited possibilities of Unreal Engine 4 and the rendering power of new consoles and gaming PCs we are thrilled to create outstanding gaming experiences as an independent studio built by veterans with more than ten years of joint(!) team experience in creating space games.\nDuring our Greenlight period on Steam we got a lot of feedback about what you would like to see in EVERSPACE\u2122. That's fantastic and we dug through all the comments on Steam and other channels to put them onto our list of stretch goals below. Some of your requests will have a huge impact on the development. Requests like multiplayer or supporting other platforms would even require to add more people to the team.\nWe are aware that not every stretch goal is equally relevant for everyone. So we made sure that most stretch goals feature something special eagerly awaited by certain fans plus something cool that we think everyone likes. We arranged our stretch goals according to what we believe will make sense for most of you and what fits into the game design or the production best.\n\n Further details\n\"Additional Languages\": ES, FR, IT, PL, PT (EN, DE, RU will be available on launch)\n\"More Devices & Consumables\": A greater number of items and consumables but also more diversified. We will put technology of a long gone alien race into the game. If you decide to use these items you will sometimes be surprised what they will actually do. So, expect some stunning effects that will not always turn out to your advantage.\n\u201cHardcore Mode\u201d: Unlock a new hardcore difficulty level with mean restrictions and unforgiving rogue-like mechanics for all the perma-death masochists out there.\nPayPal payment is now available via our website www.everspace-game.com\nWe got a lot of tiers, we know!

We all know that. However, we love the challenge (like making 3D mobile games in 2004). We execute on a very high-quality level and in a highly reliable manner. This always got us long-term deals (7 games within 5 years) with Volkswagen directly including all their top brands like Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley and Bugatti as well as global pre-load deals with Sony Ericsson and Nokia back in the days.\n\nLast but not least, a flawless track record and our excellent reputation in the industry as well as tons of Apple love earned us a new-gen console deal when we kicked-off ROCKFISH. Unfortunately, the project didn't make it into full production due to a competitive game in the console publisher's portfolio. It had nothing to do with our performance and it happens in our industry over and over again. Risky business, indeed.\n\nFor this console opportunity, the whole team worked with the Unreal Engine 4 for a top tier console publisher for nine months. During this time we became familiar with the tech very quickly and it is absolutely fantastic to work with.\n\nEarly this year we kicked off the development of EVERSPACE. We hope the gameplay trailer gives you a good impression of what we have achieved so far and that you are as excited about the game as we are. Of course, there is more to come and we will keep you updated regularly with genuine in-game footage.\n\nAlthough the prototype looks pretty sleek and plays solidly already there is still a lot of work to be done. By helping us reach our goal of \u20ac225K (approx. $250K), we will unlock additional funding from private investors.

This project is for you! I am a firm believer that in order to master game development you have to build games.

These courses are learn at your own pace. You can play the videos faster or slower if you want to. All of the games that will be produced as a part of this KickStarter are practical projects that you can use to make money, add to your portfolio, or impress your friends!

This bundle of courses will be set up so that anybody can learn how to make games. I make sure that the classes are fun, don't use overly complicated terms and that the projects are relevant. This is the bundle of courses I wish I had when I was learning how to code. \nThis class will be set up for people who have never coded before. In fact, no programming experience is required. This KickStarter will take anybody from knowing nothing about coding to being able to publish to the app store, their website, Facebook and more.

Back then it was known as Woolly Mammoth Productions. I composed game music for several XBOX 360 titles and was a freelance coder, level designer and game trailer producer. I published my first XBOX 360 game in 2010 and since then I have released a ton of iOS and Android games. In 2011 I started to produce training content. In 2012 one of our games was picked up by Nickelodeon Addicting Games. The company has been profitable since day one and we continue to expand. All of us here at Mammoth Interactive are beyond optimistic for the future.\nMy Personal Story with Online Education and How I Help People  \nI graduated during the 2008 recession. Jobs were not plentiful and most of the time I was offered an unpaid internship or a rejection letter. I remember it being very frustrating like trying to climb a mountain but never reaching the summit. Instead, I came up with the idea to intern at my own company. Hence, Mammoth Interactive was born. In 2009, I wanted to release an XBOX 360 game. The only problem was that I had learned C++ and to make an XBOX 360 game I needed to know C#. There were no classes available anywhere that showed you how to program an XBOX game. I did however find a website that streamed video tutorials. So I purchased the course and in 2010, I released my own XBOX 360 game. This was a very pivotal point in my career. People were asking me all sorts of questions and asking me to work on their games. Learning online made my career and now I help people achieve success through online learning.\nNot Just a Programming Course but a Motivational Course\nSince I started teaching at the age of 17, the number 1 problem with most students is motivation. This course is not just about learning how to program or tweening a sprite in illustrator. This course will show you how to be productive with the tips that I have learned over the years. I have produced several games, apps and courses, and I will show you how to be productive from the ground up. This sets this course apart from other programming courses. Production is not simply about getting from A to B, there is much more that needs to be learned. \nThis course will include the secrets of how to create products and effectively get them out the door. Students will learn the secrets of what the top producers know. These lessons will organically teach people about divergent thinking, rapid prototyping, productivity tips, and how they relate to design and code. Most coding courses are a simple A to B format - my courses will give people the secrets of production. After years of development, I have learned a great deal of what to do and what not to do. I will share these experiences with you throughout the course.\nLecture Format  \nThis course will show you how to build games like Lego or Ikea. These are two great companies that show people how to build complex and useful products with fantastic instructions. Through the use of video, this course enables people to begin new careers by creating a fantastic portfolio that demonstrates modern technology skills.\nWhy this Course is Personal for Me\nWhen I couldn't find a job in 2008-2009, I was frustrated all the time. I know people all over the world experience this frustration as well. Since I love seeing people succeed, it isn't enough for me to produce a fantastic course. I don\u2019t want to see smart people work in dead-end jobs or take unpaid internships with no chance of being hired full time. For me, this course is about empowerment over technology and reality.\nWhen will these courses be released?\nThese courses will be released as soon as the project is completed. When you back this project you will get this games course already produced. I have already successfully delivered a KickStarter project so you won't have to worry about me delivering the product. The entirety of this project if it gets funded will be completed in 2016 since there is a lot of material to produce and I want to make sure it is quality. \nLet's make this project a slam dunk. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks here. I have produced a lot of courses and I love producing courses. In the extremely unlikely event that I cannot complete the courses, I will refund your money.\n\nI have also successfully delivered a KickStarter project before.

I\u2019m Jevon, and I\u2019m a software architect, a web engineer, and an open source enthusiast, and living in the beautiful and vibrant city of Wellington, New Zealand.\nI\u2019ve been creating software for the last fifteen years, and web applications for the last ten. More importantly, over the last three years, I\u2019ve been creating things using cryptocurrencies, and I think they have the opportunity to revolutionise our world.\nWith cryptocurrencies, you \u2013 and only you \u2013 can control your money. Nobody can use it against your will. It\u2019s global, accessible, instant, free to use, and impossible to hack. And there are some really exciting ideas being developed using them, right now.\nBut cryptocurrencies are still too complicated to use and to understand, and we\u2019re still clinging onto ideas from the past.\nI want to help change that, and make sure that the story remains a positive one.\nWhat I'm creating\nFor the last two years, I\u2019ve created an open source project called Openclerk, which anybody can use to keep track of their cryptocurrencies, set up notifications, and create reports.\nOpenclerk is still entirely developed by me in my spare time \u2013 about eight hours every few weeks. It\u2019s enough to maintain the software, but not enough to really shake things up.\nI think Openclerk can be more than just personal finance software, more than just creating reports and doing tax.\nI want new and unexpected things to happen.\nWhat if charities could track donations more effectively? What if organisations or families could collaborate together? What if you could share reports with your friends? What if you could see your finances while you\u2019re mobile? What if all finance software became open and accessible to everybody? What kind of incredible innovation will this openness enable?\nI think Openclerk can help make some of these dreams happen.\nOn the cloud\nI understand that not everybody has the energy to install and maintain their own servers \u2013 it\u2019s quite a lot of work \u2013 so I\u2019ve also been providing a cloud service of Openclerk, called CryptFolio.\nCryptFolio uses a premium model to fund servers and one day, to pay for development & maintenance. You can try Openclerk right now by signing up for a free account.\nOutcomes\nThis kickstarter is to raise funds so that I can work on Openclerk full-time for 12 weeks, to reimagine the user experience, and to make it easier for anyone to install their own private copy.\nAt the end of this project, Openclerk (currently version 0.35) will be released at version 1.0, and have:\nA new user experience (UX), based on feedback from surveys and workshops\nA modern and accessible new user interface\nA new responsive interface, suitable for use on mobile\nCompatibility with screen-readers and other assistive technologies\nA richer API based on Openclerk components to create new tools\nTutorials and guides on how to use Openclerk more effectively\nTutorials and guides on how to install your own instance\nNew dedicated build and test servers, to improve software quality\nAll code and assets released as open source on GitHub, under GPL v3\nI won't be able to achieve these incredible changes without your help.\nStretch goals!\nFor this kickstarter, NZD $15,000 is really the minimum necessary to get a redesign off the ground. There are a number of additional goals I'd love to achieve:\nNZD $17,500 - Chef recipes and cookbooks will be provided for all backers, to make installation and upgrades easier.\nNZD $22,500 - Reports and graphs will be overhauled to be embeddable and shareable.\nNZD $27,500 - Openclerk will get its own dedicated mobile app on Android smartphones.\nNZD $37,500 - Graphs will become editable, and more reports will be added, based on your feedback.\nNZD $50,000 - Professional translators will translate Openclerk 1.0 into French, German, Chinese, Japanese and Russian.\nNZD $62,500 - Professional designers will be enlisted to improve the user interface even further.\nNZD $75,000 - Professional translators will translate Openclerk 1.0 into Filipino, Brazilian, M\u0101ori, Indian and Italian.\nWhere will funding go?\nKickstarter and bank fees: 10%\nFulfilling rewards: 14%\nRequirements & metrics capture: 3%\nUX redesign & new assets: 10%\nNew backend implementation: 17%\nNew frontend implementation: 18%\nTutorials and guides: 5%\nServer and forum setup: 7%\nSupport migration from older versions: 9%\nFixed fees for hosting, servers: 3%\nA hot desk at the Enspiral Coworking Space: 2%\nA final budget will be produced before work starts, and shared with backers.\nCryptocurrencies accepted\nYou are welcome to contribute using cryptocurrencies, and still receive the rewards.

To reduce this risk and impact, development will be agile and iterative, with regular releases.\n\nDesign can also take much longer than expected.

This same award was given to Shroud of the Avatar at E3 this year!\nSince the primary goal of this campaign is to get Shards Online to Alpha, it would be disingenuous for us to promise you a bunch of extra features at release. Instead, all of these stretch goals are for additional features that will be delivered when we reach Alpha.\nExplore the Multiverse: Out of the box, it's a complete game experience with an immersive storyline.

Leaving your fully-stocked car in the wild, unlocked, would be a terrible idea. Removing a part or two should keep it pretty safe. So you found a nice pile of old barn wood?

We met through XBOX Live back when GTA4 first came out for the 360. With both of us having a great love for video games, our casual XBOX Live gaming sessions soon turned into a great friendship. We later stumbled upon Minecraft and created a public Minecraft server (MinecraftA2Z) and website.  This server is what started our fascination with creation. Shortly after we started a Youtube Channel for the server the idea for developing Survive the Nights was hatched. After brainstorming about how we would make this game a reality, we started spending pretty much all of our free time reading/watching/listening to anything related to game developing.

All the details are here\nShards Online is breaking away from the modern MMO conventions of levels, classes and quest grinds. We are returning to living virtual worlds where stories emerge naturally as players explore the worlds laid out before them.\nThe game will launch with a complete game containing several official rule-sets. Our current plans include one with a well balanced set of gameplay, a hardcore PvP battle-royale, and even one featuring permanent character death: the ultimate game of risk versus reward.\nWe are initially targeting the PC platform, and plans for a Mac and Linux launch are in the works. Shards Online will be distributed digitally and we are strongly considering using an established platform like Steam. When you purchase the game, you will be able to play on player run clusters and run a single 'shard' with no additional cost or subscription fees.    \nUpon purchasing the game, you will also receive a 30 day optional subscription in addition to the weeks given by your reward tier that provides access to the official Citadel Clusters.  These are massive clusters running official rule-sets with real customer support, live events, and early access to new content.\nIn addition to the official Citadel Clusters, players will be able to run their own servers by signing up for a cluster server that is hosted by Citadel Studios.  We only intend to charge just enough to cover our costs. These clusters, when marked public, will be listed in-game for all players to see and join.\nUltimately, we aren't just creating game that fosters a player community, instead, we are giving our players the tools to create their own in-game communities.\nAbove a maelstrom of magic and primal forces, the remnants of a shattered world float serenely against the stars. Aria, the world that was once whole, boasted a civilization on the cusp of a revolution of thought and progress. \nOn the eve of their destruction, as the chosen few escaped through gateways long thought dead, something\u2026 changed. \nMagic was born.  \nAnd with it rose Titans of elemental might as well, ruling the aspects of Earth, Fire, Air, Water, and even Void. As the years went on histories were written and rewritten, nations rose and fell, and the remnants of Aria grew distant in people and purpose. At last only legends remained - of magical doorways to other 'shards'.   \nNow the gateways are reopening and the mortal Attuned are walking the paths between time and space to reach new, alien worlds beyond the bounds of their imaginations. Worlds of magic, mystery, steampunk science, empires, horror, beauty and more.  \nThe worlds of Shards Online await - with endless possibilities.\nSince Shards Online is a major departure from many modern MMOs, it\u2019s worth talking about what core features will be part of the official rule-sets.\nThe multiverse of Shards Online is built on a philosophy of creating living, breathing worlds. Unlike other games where quests are eternal, or special events can be relived again and again, Shards Online is a game in which actions have real consequences.\nYou can talk with the NPCs about the latest gossip, hints for adventures, or about the weather. Walk away, and you might find them already moving on to visit the pub or talking with another NPC. Everything is in motion.\nCoupling dynamic behavioral systems with real players and gods gives us incredibly rich opportunities for cause and effect. The egg you steal from a dragon today may be the reason she\u2019s attacking a town you left behind tomorrow. \nIn Shards Online, if a tree falls in the woods, we can prove it made a sound.\nWhile character attributes, spells, special abilities, and equipment define the combat tools available to the player, ultimately player skill unlocks their full potential. \nEquipment/Weapons have costs and benefits causing them to behave differently.  Picking up a sword versus a spear, or leather versus plate, will impact how your character behaves in combat.  \nSince you choose the skills, and the gear, there's no reason you couldn't be a spell wielding assassin. Two players can have characters with the same skills and equipment, but implement different strategies in combat as if they are completely different.   \nForget the rock-paper-scissors-shotgun approach to combat. In Shards Online fights can go back and forth and its not over till someone eats dirt. \nMost MMOs use a class based character development system. TWhat happens in most MMOs when you realize 20 levels in that you don\u2019t like playing the class you chose? Well either you start over from scratch, or you quit the game.\nShards Online removes these restrictions on character development by focusing on skills as the core aspect of character development. When you first create your character, you only have the basic knowledge of swinging a weapon. Learn new skills from a trainer in town, read a dusty tome found in the depths of a dark dungeon, or learn them from another player who has already mastered them.\nOnce you have learned the basics of a skill, you can begin to earn experience towards it by engaging in activities related to that skill. As you advance, new abilities will unlock. \nThere is a limit to how much skill one mortal can possess which forces you to specialize. Upon reaching your skill cap, you will need to deactivate certain skills in order to gain in others. \nIn Shards Online, players are able to build their homes in the actual game world. Many of the \u2018shards\u2019 in the game have large areas of undeveloped land for you to build houses on. \n\n\nThere are many different house layouts to choose from and the size of your house will depend on the size of your build-able area and the resources you have to build with. Cultivate the land for a farm, or have a beautiful garden. \n\nWe have big plans, currently post release, to allow for truly customizable housing.  Build your house wall by wall to your exact specifications and desires!\nCrafting skills will allow you to create new items, weapons and armor from raw materials. Since each \u2018shard\u2019 has their own stories and their own cultures, the crafting skills available to learn will also be different. Learn to craft platemail on a fantasy 'shard', or learn to craft bombs on a steampunk 'shard'. \nJust like real life, each craft employs different tools and methods. The creation of many items will require multiple steps and skills. Some items like armor and weapons will be initially very crude and need to be refined and enhanced in order to contain special properties.\nAnother unique aspect of Shards Online is the ability to hire NPCs (non-player characters) to assist you in day to day tasks. Do you lack the mining skill to obtain some ore you need? Or maybe you just don\u2019t enjoy mining? That would be a perfect opportunity to find someone else to perform the task for you\u2026 at a price. If you are rich enough, you can even run an entire trade empire without lifting a finger.\n  When we first formed Citadel Studios, we knew we wanted to create an online game. We also knew how challenging it can be to run a full scale MMO that supports hundreds of thousands of players. \n\nThe solution was simple: We let the players run their own servers.\nEach server (or \u2018shard\u2019) is a completely separate game world. These game worlds are connected together to form a much larger server (or \u2018cluster\u2019). \n\n\nThe cluster ties all of its connected 'shards' to a single rule-set. This enforces fairness since player characters are also tied to the cluster. It would not make sense to be able to bring a character that is fully geared from a 'shard' with easy rules to a 'shard' running a hardcore rule-set.\n\nCluster servers are provided by Citadel Studios and use a simple web interface for managing the cluster. Through this interface, you can select the rule-set, change settings, add 'shards' to the cluster, and manage god users. \nClusters can have any number of 'shards' connected to it. This way you can decide which maps are available to explore. Want to run a steampunk only cluster? Want to run 10 versions of the fantasy home 'shard' Celador? (think of them as alternate realities) It\u2019s completely up to the players that run the cluster.\nOur top priority with player run servers is simplicity. This is the first step to putting all the power and freedom of Shards Online squarely in the players hands.\nMortals are not the only living creatures in the many worlds of Shards Online. There are those who have escaped the icy grip of death; those who have unlocked ancient and divine powers. These immortals and gods oversee and shape the mortal realm.\nThere are many classes of immortals in the Shards Online multiverse. Normal players who ascend to immortality interact with the world on a completely different level.\nImmortals trade the foolish desires of mortals for new powers. They can change their form or become completely invisible, and instant teleportation is trivial.\nEven still, there many entities more powerful than immortals. The first of such are shard gods. 'Shard' gods have complete control over the objects, life forms and events of their home 'shard(s)'. Here is just a small sample of the powers that gods will wield:\nThis system of player moderation allows you to stay completely in character in game while still providing you with all the tools you need to create engaging game worlds. \nIn addition to the official rule-sets provided with the game by the Citadel team, players with the desire to mod the game will create custom rule-sets. Just like mods for other games, these mods will be posted online for other players to use on their clusters. While truly adventurous modders may build an entire rule-set from scratch, most custom rule-sets will be variations of one of the official rule-sets.\n\n\nOur primary goal with the modding system is to allow for easy creation of simple mods while still providing ways to allow the modder to go as deep as they want. There are many layers to the customization of Shards Online.\n\nThe most simple way to modify a rule-set is through the creation and manipulation of world objects. World objects are permanent objects that always exist in the world. A common object type is a spawner. These spawn other objects in the world such as NPCs, monsters and treasure chests.\n\nEvery single object in the game world is created through the use of object templates. These templates define the properties and behaviors of those objects. There are so many things you can create just by manipulating these templates. Here are just a few examples:\nNPCs and creatures - You can specify the equipment they are wearing and the loot they have in their pack. Give them custom dialogue and add special behaviors. \nEquipment - Templates specify the name, color, attributes and special abilities of weapons and armor.  \nSpawners - Define the region, types of creatures and respawn frequency for NPC and creature spawners. \nAt the core, nearly every aspect of gameplay is defined by behaviors written in the Lua scripting language. Even the entire combat system including skills and abilities is defined with behaviors. Here are some examples of things you can change in script:\n\nCreate new skills, abilities, crafting recipes, rare resources \nWrite new AI for NPCs and creatures. \nCreate new story lines and events. \nCreate new game modes.\n\n We have assembled an amazing team of talented and passionate developers.\nDennis Miller - Video Editing\nAimee Jarboe - Community Management\nKate Lollar and John O'Leary - Public Relations\nDave Brown - Videographer\nSean Andrew Murray -  Concept Artist\nJosh Eiten - Concept Artist\nDavison Carvalho - Concept Artist\nGreg Grimsby - Concept Artist\nYoko Hasegawa - Kickstarter Page Japanese Localization\n\u300c\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9 \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u300d\u306f\u771f\u306e\u6b21\u4e16\u4ee3\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3002\u738b\u9053MMO\u3068\u8a00\u308f\u308c\u308b\u300c\u30a6\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30de \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u300d\u3092\u7b46\u982d\u306b\u3001\u6570\u3005\u306e\u30b5\u30f3\u30c9\u30dc\u30c3\u30af\u30b9\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u6df1\u304f\u5f71\u97ff\u3092\u53d7\u3051\u3066\u4f5c\u3089\u308c\u305f\u4f5c\u54c1\u3067\u3059\u3002Citadel\u306f\u4eca\u307e\u3067\u306e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\uff08MMO\uff09\u306e\u6bbb\u304b\u3089\u629c\u3051\u51fa\u3057\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306b\u3068\u3063\u3066\u3088\u308a\u81ea\u7136\u4e14\u3064\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u300c\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9 \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u300d\u3067\u5b9f\u73fe\u3057\u307e\u3059\u3002\n \u795e\u3005\u304c\u7af6\u3044\u5408\u3046\u6df7\u6c8c\u3068\u3057\u305f\u591a\u6b21\u5143\u4e16\u754c\u3002\u300c\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9 \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u300d\u306f\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u3084\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u6301\u3063\u305f\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u4e16\u754c\uff08\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9\uff09\u3092\u4f5c\u308b\u8005\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u305d\u308c\u3092\u5207\u308a\u958b\u304f\u8005\u9054\u3092\u5f85\u3061\u69cb\u3048\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u306f\u305d\u3053\u3067\u5b9d\u3092\u63a2\u3057\u3001\u73fe\u5728\u3068\u904e\u53bb\u4e8c\u3064\u306e\u6587\u660e\u304b\u3089\u65b0\u3057\u3044\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u3084\u30a2\u30d3\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u3092\u7372\u5f97\u3057\u306a\u304c\u3089\u305d\u308c\u305e\u308c\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u5207\u308a\u958b\u3044\u3066\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u3053\u306e\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306fPC\u3092\u5bfe\u8c61\u3068\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u3001Mac\u3084Linux\u3078\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3082\u73fe\u5728\u9032\u884c\u4e2d\u3067\u3059\u3002\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u914d\u4fe1\u306e\u70baSteam\u306a\u3069\u306e\u30d7\u30e9\u30c3\u30c8\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u4f7f\u7528\u3092\u691c\u8a0e\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8cfc\u5165\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3068\u3001\u500b\u4eba\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9\u304c\u4e00\u3064\u4e0e\u3048\u3089\u308c\u3001\u66f4\u306b\u306f\u4ed6\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u30e4\u30fc\u9054\u306e\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30c9\u3067\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u3059\u308b\u4e8b\u3082\u53ef\u80fd\u3067\u3059\u3002\u8ffd\u52a0\u6599\u91d1\u306f\u767a\u751f\u3057\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\n\u4eca\u56de\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3092\u8cfc\u5165\u3055\u308c\u305f\u65b9\u306b\u306f\u8cfc\u5165\u5f8c\uff13\uff10\u65e5\u9593\u7121\u6599\u3067\u3001\u30d7\u30ec\u30df\u30a2\u30e0\u4f1a\u54e1\u306e\u307f\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u306aCitadel Clusters\u3078\u306e\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\u305d\u3053\u3067\u306f\u591a\u6570\u306e\u30af\u30e9\u30b9\u30bf\u306b\u3088\u308b\u69d8\u3005\u306a\u516c\u5f0f\u30eb\u30fc\u30eb\u30bb\u30c3\u30c8\u304c\u7528\u610f\u3055\u308c\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4ed6\u3001\u30ab\u30b9\u30bf\u30de\u30fc\u30b5\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u3084\u30e9\u30a4\u30d6\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u3001\u305d\u3057\u3066\u30b3\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3\u30c4\u3078\u306e\u65e9\u671f\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30b9\u304c\u53ef\u80fd\u306b\u306a\u308b\u306a\u3069\u306e\u7279\u5178\u3092\u7528\u610f\u3057\u3066\u304a\u308a\u307e\u3059\u3002\n\u6211\u3005\u304c\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u306e\u306f\u5358\u306a\u308b\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u3067\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093\u3002\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u81ea\u8eab\u304c\u60f3\u50cf\u529b\u3092\u767a\u63ee\u3057\u3001\u72ec\u81ea\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u3092\u4f5c\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u70ba\u306e\u30c4\u30fc\u30eb\u3092\u63d0\u4f9b\u3059\u308b\u4e8b\u304c\u6211\u3005\u306e\u76ee\u6a19\u306a\u306e\u3067\u3059\u3002", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnline games are no walk in the park.

More details available in this update ***\n*** Introducing Backer Powers! Gain unique powers only for backers. The power you get depends on your tier level, so check the Backer Powers section below for more info! ***\n\"...a genuinely refreshing idea with an unpredictable element of social experimentation\"\n        ~ PCGAMER (link)\n\"Choice Chamber is really something that needs to be seen to be fully appreciated...\"\n        ~ CLIQIST (link)\n\"There\u2019s big potential in this idea...\"\n        ~ ROCK,PAPER,SHOTGUN (link)\nChoice Chamber is a game that allows an audience of any size to play along with someone through an endless series of dangerous chambers. Players constantly give feedback that changes how the game evolves in real time, from power ups and enemies to obstacles and rule changes.\nChoice Chamber is designed to be played while being streamed live on Twitch. As you stream the game on your channel, anyone watching can participate in the game simply by typing in the chat box. A series of polls ask viewers to vote on certain aspects that alter the game's progression in real time, or viewers can trigger special events, friendly helpers, and even attack the boss themselves. Chatters can band together to help out the main player in getting far in the game, or they can work against the player and create a devilish challenge.\nThe game can also be played without using Twitch. \"Offline Mode\" keeps the game the same as before, except the choices are made by the game. In addition, you can also play privately with friends, as the chat functionality still works if you aren't broadcasting.\nart is work-in-progress, except for those sweet fireballs\nThe current prototype has lots of potential, and while many new ideas will be coming directly from backers like you, here is an overview of what to expect in the game once it's finished:\nAvailable on PC & Mac\nOffline Mode - Play on your own without the help of the chat room.\nAdditional Characters\nNew Weapons\nNew Gizmos & Special Events\nNew Enemies & Bosses\nNew Room Types - Rooms that challenge, surprise, change the tempo, etc.\nPermanent Collectibles - Things kept across play sessions\nMod Support - Custom music, player graphics, etc. There's a stretch goal to expand upon this (see below).\nMany More Polls - Including polls that scale based on the number of current players\nNew Chat Interactions - More than just a popular vote, but new ways to connect chatters with the player (check the next section!)\nmock-up: viewers help create a bridge via their speech bubbles\nmock-up: viewers fight a boss alongside the player by giving screen coordinates\nmock-up: viewers summon individual minions to help fight big bad things\nIn short: Everything. Right now, the prototype allows for voting upon the player's weapons, abilities, special maneuvers, all variations of powerups - both physical and elemental, enemy load outs, and terrain formations including claustrophobia and lava hazards. It's a good start, but there's tons more that will be added to the game.\nNot only will the chat be able to vote on more complex variations of existing possibilities, but new kinds of interactions will be created as well. Some of these include the ability to fight alongside the player through crowd-sourced attacks and a way to individualize each chatter to allow for multitasking challenges.\nChoice Chamber is currently just a prototype, an idea with potential to grow. This Kickstarter is the perfect solution to allow a full exploration of the possibilities that can come to life and create truly unique experiences.\nThe funding goal is set to an amount that will allow Studio Bean to really find out what makes a game like this unique, taking into account the time required to interact with backers and come up with lots of great content. There's also of course the standard 5% given to Kickstarter, 5% given to Amazon (for payments), and an additional 20% that gets taxed.\nDevelopment on the game will go into full force on June 1st. The majority of these funds will provide Michael (the main developer) with money for food, rent, etc. for the entirety of the project's development time.\nblending in with the huskies (art is work-in-progress)\n Backer Powers will be given to backers in every tier! These are abilities that you'll be able to enter into the chat once every round, and will only be available to those who back this Kickstarter! They certainly get juicier as you go up, so to find out which you'll get, see the table below.\nCredits\nYour name listed in the credits! This comes with every tier and will be a delight to read through. Trust us.\nThe Game\nA digital download of Choice Chamber upon completion. DRM-free. No Twitch account required.\nPrototype\nAfter the campaign is successfully funded and ended, you'll receive a download for the current prototype version of the game you might have seen floating around Twitch. (PC only)\nSoundtrack\nNot only does this include a download of the full arranged set of original music found in the game in both MP3 and FLAC formats, but it also includes a PDF of liner notes to shed some light on just what went into those grooves.\nBeta\nDuring development of the game, you'll be given in-progress beta versions of the game that are ripe with new untested features! Be one of the first to play the game as it grows and help shape it into its final form.\nArt Book\nThis art book PDF will contain the history of Choice Chamber's development - not only through sketches and illustrations, but with annotations and other scribblings in the gutter to give a whimsical look into how a game evolves over the course of its development.\nPower Pack\nGain the ability to use both the Player Boost and the Hellfire & Hoarfrost Backer Powers in the game (see Backer Powers section above). All other tiers only give you one Backer Power, effectively making you a huge help in times of need.\nPoll\nThe first of many design-your-own tier rewards, the Poll Design allows you to come up with something to ask the players in the chat, including their possible responses and how those decisions affect the game. It's super fun and we'll be sure to help out along the way.\nEnemy\nDesign an Enemy is a fun one, as you'll be fighting a lot of these things throughout the game, whatever they end up being. Again, we'll provide assistance to make sure everything stays cohesive to the game's image, but we strongly encourage creative juices to flow like wine.\nWeapon\nDesign a Weapon is really important, since it's the only way for you to protect yourself in those dangerous chambers. Do you go for a blunt melee weapon with a lot of punch? A long-range weapon that lets you stay at a safe distance? A fireball launcher with a bayonet? Let's surprise ourselves.\nBoss\nAh, the Design a Boss reward. There won't be too many of these hulking beasts in the game, which is all the more reason they need to stand out and be as unique as they are memorable. We'll work with you to come up with a truly menacing creature, something you'd be proud to put up on your fridge.\nSpecial Event\nSpecial Events are rarely used in a gameplay session, but when they are, oh what a difference they can make! These screen-filling enemy-evaporating maneuvers will be a treat to come up with.\nGizmo\nEveryone's favorite little helper, the Design a Gizmo / Gizmo Power will allow you to come up with a new kind of Gizmo to assist with battle in the chambers. Or maybe it's a healing Gizmo? Maybe it just lightly blows on enemies until they trip and fall in a pit? The possibilities have no end.\nIllustration\nThis high-resolution colorful digital painting can be of basically anything you want, drawn in the style of Choice Chamber's vibrant world. Let us know what excites you most and Bean will work his magic to capture it in a single image.\nDirector's Cut\nThis one's just insane. You get to design one of every Design-a-thing above, from Polls and Weapons to Enemies and Bosses. Mark your creative influence on the game with significant style.\nDay Jam Game\nThe ultimate reward of rewards, the Let's Make a Game Together in a Day Reward not only will see us buddying up to make whatever your heart desires within the confines of 24 hours, but this tier also includes the entirety of the Director's Cut above. Rest assured, we'll have some fond memories when this is all over. If you're near us in the world, let's do it in person!

Choice Chamber is the next step not only for us, but also for a widely growing world that allows more people to be connected than ever before.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKeeping in scope to deliver on time is almost always the greatest risk. Luckily, as Choice Chamber is procedural, any one of the polls, enemies, bosses, etc. can be cut from the project without compromising the ability to ship the game. We've had experience cutting content without sacrificing quality, on both independent and professional projects, and are well equipped to deal with feature creep. \n\nIn regards to the tiers that allow backers to help design various things, we'd make sure to preserve those if the time ever came to reduce content, and we'll be working with backers to ensure they fit the scope.\n\nWe're also mitigating the risk of developing across platforms through extensive conversations with other independent developers who have ported cross-platform.

The game features hardcore survival and player interaction in dark science fiction setting. You will be able to select from one of the 8 classes, equip your marine out with your weapons of choice and co-operate with your team using advanced tactics to stay ahead of the enemy.\nBunker up! Some amazing advanced tactics, bunker defense action in this exclusive new Kickstarter screenshot\nThe game is real time with a top-down perspective and features randomized map features (items, missions, monsters) allowing for good replayability for every mission playthrough which may last up to an hour or less depending on your team's capabilities.  \nStorm can get really bad, and you have to handle it! :)\nThis is a tactical game that involves a lot of action and shooting at the same time but tread carefully, ammunition and medical supplies are not unlimited and lacking either will get you killed quickly, so you must constantly manage you resources and scavenge more if you have long term survival plans. \nFortyfying a position while waiting for friendly reinforcements to arrive via dropship. Taking care of the baddies in the meantime.\nAs you play through your mission, the enemy swarms will get larger and harder to the point where you will be overwhelmed if you don\u2019t deal with them. You must constantly be on the move looking to accomplish your main and side objectives, as doing so successfully will reward you with ranks and medals.\nSingle player campaign\nBesides the 8-player coop core campaign in TRS we currently do have fundamental development and setup done for narrative focused single player campaign as well. It will definetly be a part of the game but we do need more funds to develop it as we originally intended, with enough details, emotion and flavor. If we manage to hit the needed stretch goals we will have enough to invest into developing a rich and epic story based single player campaign with great cutscenes. But because of your requests we have decided to make a substantial singleplayer campaign part of the MAIN FUNDING GOAL right now. Although the full blown epic version remains a part of our stretch goals.\nThe Red Solstice is currently expected to release on Windows, PC with future possibilities of being developed for Mac, Linux, tablets or even consoles.\nIn the year 2060 the Earth was ravaged by a virus pandemic of a magnitude greater than the Bubonic plague. The virus spread quickly, those who were infected became something less human, willing carriers of the modern-day plague. Government action came too late, and as the chaos escalated corporate agencies rushed space programs in a desperate bid to evacuate the planet, since a cure could not be found. The fledgling colonies of Mars became humanity's last bastion, and since no traces of the virus was found among the lucky few who boarded the space vessels bound for the Red Planet, it was believed the danger had been averted.\nIt is now the year 117 AE (After Earth) terraforming is well under way, however during an exceptionally violent storm dubbed The Red Solstice, communication lines between Tharsis, the colony referred to as The Capital and the remaining human settlements of Mars are disrupted. The Elysium Corporation deploys its elite marine task force to investigate what happened to the colony.\n\"The Sumerian chthonic deity Ker, a great burrowing worm whose digestive tract is a doorway to the Underworld.\" It's basicaly a big, huge bad and mean sandworm that players need to battle. Part of primary storyline is based around it.\nWhat they find will forever change their lives and the lives of all the inhabitants of the Red Planet.\nThe Red Solstice is a new breed of core tactical shooter, and as such it will challenge your skills, so good consideration has to be placed on character, weapon, and skill selection, resource management, player positioning, friendly fire and of course team play and strategy.\nRandomized gameplay\nSince the game is randomized at every play through, enemies will appear in different places and resource allocation will change, the player must adapt to succeed. Even a well planed offensive may fail, so it is important to react and adapt fast.\nProtecting a VIP and fortifying your position while under heavy pressure, if VIP dies, bad things happen!\nThe game has several difficulty settings, however if you are looking for a greater challenge instead of the standard ship landing you have the option to arrive on Tharsis via drop pod, which separates you from the team. In this way you will have to fight just to reach your team and regroup.\nFeatures\n- Teamwork and Tactics: The game\u2019s strong point is its player co-op. Up to 8 player may form a squad and the game will scale to how many team mates you have. Forward thinking and good planning is crucial to success.\n- Random loot: With every playthrough you will find new (cool and random) items on the level. As you cannot carry everything, you must decide what will you take with you - medical supplies, support items or even explosives. Your success depends on your choice.\n- 8 classes: A lot of the play style diversity comes out of the ability to choose one of the 8 available classes for your character - Assault, Heavy Support, Recon, Marksman, Demolition, Terminator, Hellfire and Medic\n- Survival: Over the course of the game session growing swarms of mutated monsters and rebels will assail you, keeping your adrenaline racing and your heart pounding.\nInsurgents, their commander, and the usual welcoming party, they are one of many enemies that will put all your survival skills to test. Different and more cautious tactics will need to be applied to take them down safely.\n- Sandbox Map and High Replay value: You will be able to choose how you go about your missions. Either free roam, camp or use some exploratory tactics or other over the top audacious plans even we haven\u2019t considered.\n- Gear up and Scavenge for supplies: The Elysium Corporation will provide you with a large assortment of brutally effective arms and armor. Also, other ordinance and supplies may be found in the field to help you win your battles.\n- Achievements and Ranks: With bravery and valor you will be able to save the Tharsis colony and, in so doing, you will earn medals and ranks. Follow the Way of the Warrior and you will triumph!\nExtended gameplay video\nYou have seen our Kickstarter video, played the demo, but you want more details? Well the best thing would be to have a peek at extended gameplay video being narrated by our charismatic CEO Hrvoje Horvatek. So here you go...\nOur main goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to secure the funds needed to polish up the game, add a lot more new content and finish up the development during next four months! While doing that early access beta will be available to all our backers after and including the Special Recruit reward tier.\nBut what would happen if we manage to gather more support and money then we expected? We have a plan!\nOne of the next steps would be to add a very substantial and cinematic singleplayer campaign to the game, making it even more attractive and diverse to variety of players.\nWe will elaborate more on all of our stretch goals as we pass the main funding goal, so for now just have a quick peek at what the future holds in our infographic.\nMac and Linux support are definitve options if we make the stretchgoals, tablet support might be on the way as well...Mac and Linux support are definitve options if we make the stretchgoals, tablet support might be on the way as wellMac and Linux support\nThere is also the possibility of adding MODDING tools at even higher stretch goals.\nWe wanted to somehow reward our supporters for spreading the word about this Kickstarter campaign and the game itself so we have decided to opt for two various ways of doing so.\nNew monster every 1000 Facebook fans \nWe will be adding a new monster to the enemy roster as we gather every 1000 new Facebook fans at the official The Red Solstice Facebook page.\nNew boss monster every 1000 Kickstarter backers\nAs we gather more and more support from our Kickstarter backers we will be adding a new epic dangerous boss monster to the game - after every new 1000 backers.\nIf we manage to gather some really high level of support we will be announcing few more surprises!\nAbout the team\nIronward is a small but experienced indie team from Croatia. We are trying to create something new and unique that has not been present at the market so far. We think that games need to evolve and new things need to be presented to the players. So far we have been working on The Red Solstice for few years and we have financed the whole development by ourselves.\nPreviously at various other teams our members have worked on many smaller game projects like Legacy: Dark Shadows, Dominance: Throne of Elders and Tale of the Forgotten Ones. The Red Solstice is our big breakthrough game as team and at the same time our dream project! Missing members from this picture are Gregory Hlavac and Danijel Ribi\u0107!\nCore of the Ironward team at Reboot InfoGamer con - Hrvoje Horvatek (CEO and game designer), Davor Ivanu\u0161 (progammer), Vjeko Ko\u0161\u010devi\u0107 (artist), Danijel Mandi\u0107 (environment artist/scripter) + some of our close supporters.\nMost of the rewards for the game are digital in nature. We decided to offer only very limited amount of cover art posters and just one more very special physical reward for our highest backer tier.\nPledge Add-Ons\nYou have asked for them and we are here to answer! We are adding first batch of possible pledge Add-Ons that you can add to already selected reward tiers by simply adding the needed amount to your updated pledge. So here they are:\nAdditional game key - 12$ each (add up to maximum of additional 3)\nFull squad game key set - 70$ (pack of 7 additional keys, limit of one per backer)\nSpecial Kickstarter backer forum access\nGain access to special backers forum at www.theredsolstice.com soon after the Kickstarter is over, includes every tier after and including Special Recruit reward tier.\nGame keys\nAll game keys will be delivered to our backers over email. As the game has already been Greenlit all of those keys will be Steam keys.\nBeta\nWe will be offering Beta early access keys to all of our backers that support us at Special Recruit or higher reward tier level. Expected Beta release date is a month after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nIt's a perfect plan, gone perfectly wrong! Someone pressed the wrong button?\nShort digital comic\nWith great art from Ironward art team, it will serve it's use as a great introduction to characters and setting of The Red Solstice.\nLimited edition cover poster\nAll backers from Squad Leader tier and up will get our limited edition cover art poster, signed by The Red Solstice team.

We are talking contributions via Paypal (using a Paypal account or Credit Card) for about 11 days after the Kickstarter ends. We will be adding another payment option via Swipe (Credit/Debit Cards) in a few days if you wish not to use Paypal (or cannot). You can find the new Crowdfunding option for Paypal on our website by clicking on the image. All contributions will be added towards the Stretch Goals.\nWith the campaign coming to an end we are happy to share a new Teaser video. \nWe also have a detailed Backer Grid for all pledges making it easy to figure out what is included. Please continue to read on for more details about the project and be sure to check out our website and forums for additional information.\nOne of the most anticipated MMOs of 2014.\nThe Repopulation is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game in a science fiction setting.  In many ways it is a throwback to the social aspects and sandbox driven gameplay that made titles like Star Wars Galaxies and Ultima Online successful. But it also integrates more recent innovations and introduces an array of its own unique wrinkles.\nThe driving force behind this game is choice to play the game in the way that you want to play it. The choice to play the game like an RPG or a first/third person shooter. To advance your character through combat or peaceful means. The freedom to craft and harvest without being forced into combat. To act as a hero or a villain. A thief, diplomat, home builder, tamer, crafter, or an entertainer. To participate in Player vs. Player combat or to avoid it altogether.\n  Unique three faction PvP system, where the third faction is allowed to set its alliances on a nation by nation basis.\nFeaturing both a Standard and a Hardcore rule set for PvP on separate servers. Standard rules include large protected regions where players can avoid PvP completely if they wish, and no player looting is allowed.\nBuild cities in the open world or besiege the cities of your enemies.\nThe city management system allows Mayors to micromanage a city\u2019s resources and happiness levels.\nMilitary advancement system which rewards players with special abilities, titles, and gear.\nSet your alliances with other nations to one of five different levels ranging from Ally to Nemesis.\nCreate up to 99 ranks for your nation, each with their own customizable names and settings.\nEngagements are similar to public quests which can mutate and spread throughout an area, changing its appearance or content. \nHow players respond to an engagement will affect how it progresses or spreads.\nEngagements are intended to get players working together from the early stages of the game or encourage exploration.\nThere are both combat and non-combat oriented engagements.\nMany engagements have long-term and far reaching effects.\nSettlements can turn into dungeons and towns can be overrun. Allowing this to happen can seriously alter the content available in an area.\nPlayer vs. Player engagements are similar to Open World battlegrounds.\nInquire with NPCs to find out which engagements are available in different areas throughout the world.\nAuto-grouping options allow you to instantly group up with nearby participants, or disable it to play a more solo style.\nAn Advanced Generated Mission system allows us to create complex multi-stage missions which are tailored specifically for your character.\nMissions can have branching outcomes based on a player\u2019s actions and choices.\nGenerated missions are mailed to your character as job offers and are accessible from anywhere in the game using your in-game PDA system.\nNPCs can speak about things that have happened to them. You can inquire of them to ask questions about many things, revealing hidden bits of knowledge or even special missions.\nYour actions will be remembered by NPCs, and they may attempt to exploit your tendencies.\nOne Time Missions spawn in random locations throughout the wilderness to encourage exploration.\nPlayers can filter which types of missions they wish to receive, so only those missions are generated for them.\nMissions are not all combat oriented. There are crafting, harvesting, diplomatic, theft related, taming, and other non-combat variations available.\nCompleting missions in a group will generate bonus rewards and automatically split them among your group.\n\nSkills based gameplay which features over 75 unique skills, and 12 tiers within each skill line.\nPlayers are not forced into combat roles. Crafting, harvesting, diplomatic, trapping, taming, entertainment, and other non-combat oriented skills can operate and progress independently of combat.\nSkills increase automatically through use. Abilities are earned and not given automatically.\nMultiple hidden skills waiting to be unlocked by true achievers.\nSkill Imprinting system allows you to imprint knowledge of skills into yourself, to make up for time spent doing other activities such as missions or engagements.\n\nAdvanced Crafting systems which allows players to create thousands of variations of items through a total of 24 different trade skills.\nThree distinct harvesting methods: Harvester, Manual or Extracted. Harvesters allow you to place harvesters on nodes and then return to collect the resources later. Manual harvesting utilizes tools and requires player interaction with each node. Or you can extract resources such as hides, meat, tissue or DNA from corpses.\nOver-harvested areas will run dry of resources and recover slowly, rewarding players for discovering more remote locations.\nThe crafting event system will require players to make decisions during the crafting process which will influence their result.\nEach of the game\u2019s recipes has its own mastery level which can be increased to produce higher quality items.\nExtensive customization through the refinement process and fitting systems.\nAccess the Auction Network from anyplace in the world using your in-game PDA. Place work orders as well requesting a certain resource at a requested grade.\nTwo distinct modes of combat: Action Mode and RPG Mode. RPG Mode works like traditional RPG combat. Action Mode allows players to control the game in ways similar to a First Person Shooter. You can toggle between these modes at any time.\nSeveral twists to make combat more interesting including Momentum, Limb Targeting, Species Mastery, Energy Shields, Cover, and Postures.\nGenerated special abilities system for bosses will force groups or raids to adjust on the fly when fighting bosses, rather than simply looking up spoiler information on the internet.\nEncourages grouping with a slew of social features such as skill gain bonuses and treasure bonuses while grouped. Along with those bonuses, combat abilities make use of openings created by other player\u2019s abilities allowing for players to exploit those openings.\nJump into combat in a vehicle, mech, or manned turret.\nDive, roll and attack on the move.\nCustomize your playing style with the fitting system. Weapons and armor come in cosmetic shells with the same stats and can be further modified via fittings that are placed in the shells like a socket or augmentation\nEntertain others through music, dance, or storytelling.\nUtilize your diplomacy or intimidation skills and inquiries to manipulate NPCs, revealing hidden opportunities.\nSurvival skills include trapping, tracking, and the ability to set up camps or scrounge for materials.\nRogue skills including thievery, stealth, hacking, and acrobatics.\nTame animals when they are young, then have them slowly grow into fully matured pets if they receive proper care and feeding.\nGenetically engineer species and hybrids by splicing DNA and Tissue from different species.\nCustomize your vehicles and robotic pets.\nBuild your home or player city and showcase it to other players.\n         Kotaku - Editorial\nhttp://kotaku.com/its-like-star-wars-galaxies-and-ultima-online-are-havi-1490254838\nMMORPG - PAXPrime 2013 Awards - Selected as Rising Star\nhttp://www.mmorpg.com/showFeature.cfm/f ... wards.html\nMMOHuts - PAXPrime Live Gameplay Video and Interview\nhttp://mmohuts.com/videos/the-repopulat ... early-look\nMMORPG - Something Grand in the Sand (Preview)\nhttp://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game ... -Sand.html\nONRPG - PaxPrime Roundup - The Repopulation\nhttp://www.onrpg.com/articles/editorial ... roundup/4/\nMMO Attack - The Repopulation Video Interview | PAXPrime 2013\nhttp://mmoattack.com/mmo-videos/the-repopulation-interview-pax-prime-2013\nThe ArcheAge Report Podcast, Special PAX 2013 Episode\nMMOHuts - MMO Huts PAXPrime Indie Preview\nMODSOnline - PAX Prime 2013\nMassively - PAX East 2013 Hands on with The Repopulation\nhttp://massively.joystiq.com/2013/03/25/pax-east-2013-hands-on-with-the-repopulation/\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe ran a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2012, which helped the project immensely. It allowed us to bring a few important people on full-time, and drew a lot of attention to the project. In the past 18 months development has continued at a rapid pace. We had a presence at both PAX East and PAX Prime this year, and our community has continued to grow steadily.\nWe are nearing the point of the game, pushing from alpha into beta testing. We intend to start beta preview events in March, with beta following soon after. With us reaching this stage, we're at the point of trying to decide which fringe features will make or miss the games launch. We have a number of features that are on the bubble, and could easily be pushed to post-launch. Though if we had a little extra funding we could also bring on some additional hands to squeeze them into launch.\nWe made the decisions to have a second round of Kickstarter, and to use it to determine which features get pushed to post-launch and which make it in to release. It should be noted that none of these are cut features. These are fringe features that were never promised for launch, but most of them have been things that have been discussed and in many cases inquired about on our forums. So this Kickstarter is an opportunity for the community to determine what makes it into launch and what squeezes to post-launch.\nWhat Is My Money Going Towards?\nAfter Kickstarter and Amazon take their respective cuts, the remainder of the funding will go directly toward development. The majority of the funding will go toward developers allowing us to deliver more content and as a result a better product at launch. A smaller portion of the funding will go toward licensing requirements allowing more flexibility moving forward.\nAbove and Beyond Technologies was formed in 2009 and consisted of the core member JC Smith, Joshua Halls and Stadi Thompson. Since then the team has have grown to over 30 members. Some of Above & Beyond\u2019s staff and contributors have worked on such titles as Everquest, Star War Galaxies, Call of Duty, Free Realms, Virtua Tennis, and Homefront.\nPackage Upgrades (Bump Ups) for Previous Supporters\nPlease check out the Package Upgrade section on our website for how to perform a Package Upgrade.\nPledge Level Descriptions\nWe have a wide variety of offerings for our pledges,  this section will explain what those are in detail so you know what you are getting. Many of the early tiers offer a substantial reduction in cost of packages and credits that will be available upon launch so not only are you donating to the cause, you are getting memberships and store credits for half off. If you have any further questions by all means ask us.\nMembership Package\nWe are what is called in the industry a Free to Play (F2P) title. We distribute the game for free and you can play it at no continuing cost. Obviously, the game will not last very long if no one pays any money so we sell memberships with additional perks.\nWe currently plan on offering 3 memberships with each membership including the previous membership\u2019s offerings. The memberships are a one time purchase much like paying a box fee for a game compared to a subscription that is paid every month. The currently planned offerings for each membership is as follows.\nSilver Membership\nAdditional Character, Inventory, Bank, Shared Bank, Mission, and Auction Slots.\nAccess to City Council and Nation Leadership options.\nGold Membership\nMore Character, Inventory, Bank, Shared Bank, Mission, and Auction Slots.\nAbility become a city mayor and run a player city.\nPlatinum Membership\nMore Character, Inventory, Bank, Shared Bank, Mission, and Auction Slots.\nAbility to create a new nation.\nMemberships are offered as part of packages now, but will be available for future purchase upon release. You will be able to upgrade your membership as well with your existing store credit or newly purchased credit once the game is released.\nStore Credit\nPart of being F2P is having a cash shop where players can purchase in-game items. We do not sell what are considered Pay to Win (P2W) items that require players to spend money in hopes to compete in the game; instead, we sell cosmetic items that players can use in-game along with a small variety of time saving options such as Items commonly referred to as experience potions. Store Credit can also be used to purchase or upgrade a membership if you don\u2019t have all of the levels. We understand the value of both paying and non paying customers and want to provide incentives to paying customers without non paying customers feeling like they are playing a demo. Store Credit will be given at release and is non refundable.\nAlpha and Beta Testing\nAlpha and Beta testing is the process before release where the game is nearly complete and players are allowed to play to test out the game. They help with final bug reporting and to stress test the servers. We are offering 5 levels of Beta testing as part of the pledges.\nClosed Alpha Round 3 Access (CA3)\nCA3 backers will have access to Closed Alpha Round 3 during all testing periods. Closed Alpha Round 3 starts March 2014.\nClosed Beta Round 1 Plus Access (CB1+)\nCB1+ backers will have access to Closed Beta Round 1 during all testing periods. CB1+ backers will have 2 weekends of access during Closed Alpha Round 3 and have preferred choice over CB1 backers for those weekends.\nClosed Beta Round 1 Access (CB1)\nCB1 backers will have access to Closed Beta Round 1 during all testing periods. CB1 backers will have 1 weekend of access during Closed Alpha Round 3.\nClosed Beta Round 2 Access (CB2)\nCB2 backers will have access to Closed Beta Round 2 during all testing periods. CB2 backers will also be given one weekend during Closed Beta 1.\nClosed Beta Round 3 Access (CB3)\nCB3 backers will have access to Closed Beta Round 3 during all testing periods. CB3 backers will also be given one weekend during Closed Beta 2.\nHead Start\nOnce Beta is over and the servers are ready to be opened you will get a head start on everyone else. The listed is the minimum you will be given and there might be more based on the number of players. If there is any kind of queue or limit on active accounts upon release any head start member will skip this aspect and be included in the initial count. There will be no data wipe during this process so whatever you have you get to keep once the general public is allowed on the server.\nTitles\nYou will be granted titles that are exclusive to this promotion that can be used in game. These perks will not be available for purchase upon release.\nRepop tokens\nThese are special tokens that can be used to get special in-game items as a thank you for supporting us. Instead of giving specific ones at each level we will offer you tokens and you will have a choice of different options with some costing more than 1 token. These items will be cosmetic in nature only and will not give you any additional functionality or power over other players. Examples of what you can expect are: equipable shell items such as armor, weapons, and clothing, a special edition vehicle, and trinkets and even special buildings for your housing and nation.\nFounder or Voyage plaque\nThe Founder Plaque and Voyage Plaque are large monuments that will be displayed in both of the major cities in the game for either the OWON or FPR faction.  We will etch an approved name into one of the monuments for everyone to see in game.  We will also do a \u201cphoto-op\u201d with everyone in game if there is interest once in Beta for everyone to keep as a memento if they wish. This plaque is awarded to all other tiers above it as well.\nThere are additional levels that will get you a higher rank on the plaque so you will be listed with less people. A small plaque will be given that can be used in your private housing to show off as well at higher tiers.\nCharacter Name inserted into Lore\nAn approved name of your choosing will be inserted into the game lore. We will present you with a few options on where it can go and you will choose from them. The reference will be a minor one and will not be associated with an NPC unless you have an NPC at another tier.\nCustom NPC\nWe will work with you on the appearance and name of an NPC that will be used in the game and players will interact with at different levels. In higher tiers you will specify Personality, Profession and Mood for your NPC that allows the NPC to be part of more missions tailored to your liking. This could include different traits that can be viewed as positive or negative depending on how you look at it. We reserve the right to deny any suggestions here and hope of course we do not have to do that. Part of this perk is that we will perform this on the development server so you will get to watch as we do it in real time and the next update your NPC will be live in the testing environment. Development server access is for the period of time only to create the NPC unless you have previous access for some other reason.\nHousing Plot\nWe plan on offering 3 distinct housing options: Instanced housing, PvE housing, and Player city Housing. The Housing Plot perk is for a guaranteed housing plot in the PvE housing areas on the Normal server only. Additional plots will be made available upon release for players to earn in game, but as part of being an early adopter you will be granted a guaranteed plot. The PvE housing areas will have a higher concentration of housing plots, but will also have other PvE content so players will want to visit the area for the content. Larger plots will be given out at higher levels that will accommodate larger buildings.\nOnce a plot is used you will need to maintain an active account every 90 days to keep the plot from being unclaimed and available to be claimed by someone else. If you come back after a plot has been reclaimed you will need to select a new plot and your previous house and all associated objects will be moved to the new plot. Claiming a new plot after inactivity might not be something that can be done instantly based on available resources upon your return, but will be fulfilled in a reasonable amount of time. An extension of the 90 days will be considered upon request.\nHousing plot owners will be able to claim a 2nd plot on their character so they may maintain a player city housing plot along with their backer rewarded housing plot.\nCustom Logo for Armor or Clothing\nWe will create a custom armor shell based on one of the existing shells in the game with your design pattern of choice on the piece of armor or clothing (such as a logo or emblem).  You will also get a recipe to create these and hand them out to others.\nCustom Weapon\nThis is a truly custom weapon that will be a different look from the others in the game and unique in that sense. Since we use what we call shells for items the weapon will not have any advantage over others besides people drooling over it while you stand there. We will try to work with you on tweaking it some, but please understand we will present some ideas and go with some minor modifications from there. If you are capable of drawing or designing the weapon we will try to work from that as well to the best of our ability. Part of this perk is that we will perform this on the development server so you will get to watch as we do it in real time and the next update your weapon will be live in the testing environment. Development server access is for the period of time only to create the weapon unless you have previous access for some other reason. You will also get a recipe to create these and hand them out to others.\nMonument\nAlong with the giant plaque, each city will have 12 statue monuments to some of the great leaders of the past. We will work with you on becoming one of those statues and introducing some lore into the game about that individual. We do reserve some rights on how far we can go with the lore and will try to work with you the best we can. Part of this perk is that we will perform this on the development server so you will get to watch as we do it in real time and the next update your statue will be live in the testing environment. Development server access is for the period of time only to create the statue unless you have previous access for some other reason.\nGenerated Mission Template\nWow thanks for supporting us, first off. You will get to work with the team first hand to create a generated mission template that will be used in game. We will work with you on a complex generated mission up to 20 steps.  This will be much more complicated than a simple kill 10 of x mission and hopefully other players will appreciate the work everyone put into this.\nMeet and greet at a major gaming conference\nYou can choose to come and meet us at any conference we attend in 2014-2015. You will be invited to a dinner during the conference where you can chat up the team. We are open to working with you on other ideas during the conference if you have them as past backers at this level helped us run the booth as well. You will be responsible for paying for all costs to attend beyond badges as we will provide those.\nStretch Goal Descriptions\nYou can find the full list of Stretch Goals and their descriptions on our website.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost Kickstarter projects are in their early development stages where they have concepts and ideas to present. We are close to going into a legitimate Beta cycle and have many hours of content waiting to be tested and consumed. We have built a solid team over the past few years and with the success of this Kickstarter campaign we will be able to expand our team slightly to fill in a few gaps.\n\nWe have a good track record of progress over the years with monthly updates and a solid reputation among MMO websites as being a professional company with a very solid product. We have a previous Kickstarter under our belts, 3 industry shows, and some hair loss, but the project is still progressing forward.\n\nOur reward levels are all digital rewards with established costs and the stretch goals we were careful not to over promise and have to overextend ourselves in an attempt to fulfill these goals. This is important as everyone might enjoy a t-shirt, but there is a very real cost and logistical cost in managing all of that. Do you want a t-shirt or time (and money) spent improving this game?\n\nWe plan to show more of the game with some feature videos during the campaign for those looking for more information about certain features and how they work or are currently working. We hope all of these things help us to earn your pledge and support and help us earn the support of all of your closest friends and acquaintances as well.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "April 2016 Update", "update_content": "Hello, we wanted to make sure everyone was updated that keys were sent out to everyone at the $100 level or higher.

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking.

I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now. Developing games has been a passion of mine since I was a child, though I've never had the courage and support until now to actually release something into the wild. Spread your neon wings you sweet pixelated bastard!\nBeau Blyth (Teknopants) -teknopants.com, @Teknopants\nLead Programmer + Tremendous Hair\nDeveloped loads of rad fast-paced arcade style games including the upcoming super bad-ass Samurai Gunn. A master of many disciplines and the man helping me code this beastly project. A massive thanks and unending high fives/hugs/punches go his way. Also payment.\nRich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) - disasterpeace.com/, @Disasterpeace\nMusical Score + Piercing Eyes\nThis chip-blasting machine of a man has produced tons of fantastic game albums, most notably Fez. (Which completely wrecked my mind for a solid year.) I've been lucky enough to get him aboard on this project to develop the soundtrack; you know he'll deliver something special.\nWill Wiesenfeld (Baths)- bathsmusic.com, @BATHSmusic\nContributor + Super Fantastic Beat-dropper\nA supreme talent and fine craftsman of music and smiles, also known as the one-man pound-storm of deep beats and carnal wailing that is Baths, has produced the trailer track. Is producing another track for the game during production.\nTeddy Diefenbach (TeddyDief) -teddydiefenbach.com, @TeddyDief\nA thoughtful soul who created The Moonlighters and Shove Pro, co-founded Rad Dragon, is a programmer and game designer extraordinaire. Dives deep into things such as systems design, narrative design and his ultimate mission of recreating the golden age of late 90s Squaresoft.\nThe Game\nAll copies will be sent out upon release 2014. Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX and now PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA. PC copies can be DRM-free or Steam keys (thanks to our backers pushing us through Greenlight!). Everyone in the $10 tier will get the PC/Mac/Linux game on release, $15 and above will net you an option for PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA, and the $25 tier receives a Kickstarter exclusive version of the game with bonus side quest.\nInstruction Booklet\nA nifty little booklet to bring you back to the days when manuals meant something; revealing a little known move, a secret passage, or simply bolstering the story and context of the world outside of the game. This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this. Plus silly drawings of cat creatures and Pork-Peoples will be stuffed into the pages for pure entertainment purposes. Much mocking of lowly creatures shall be had!\nOriginal Soundtrack\nThe master Rich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) will be composing the eerie OST for this game! I'm jazz-handin' all around this room with excitement at this very moment, nearly unable to continue typing! The full OST will be included in digital form at the $40 Tier with bonus tracks. Boom!\nAlternate Drifter\nReceive a Kickstarter-only alternative main playable character to destroy and explore with. He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear. This is no fools errand; you'll be creating (digital) life itself, and thus comes the responsibility to nurture the sad heap until it's of age to brutalize Drifters every moment it can.\nDesign a mid-boss creature\nHave you always wanted an angry spider to lob shells at you? Well we can help bring your vision to life! Together we will build an entire mid-boss encounter, with behavior patterns, chamber layout, the look of the creature and it's rewards. As above, choose attributes wisely.\nT-Shirt Special\nThe $60 tier will net you a snazzy design from Casey Hunt in small, medium, large or XL. This will be available to purchase sometime after the Kickstarter as well, so those who have already donated won't be left without something to wear.\nParty in the city\nYou'll join us (a bunch of goofy independent developers) for a wrap party evening of hangabouts, Smash Brothers (plus other multi-player games) and general raging at Glitch City, the Culver City Indie game space. You'll also receive a hand-signed print, a few high fives, and some great big smiles. Your name will be listed in the credits under the Major Thank-You section. \nReference Sheet\n  Add-Ons\nYou can add extra rewards to your current tier if you so desire (remember, no need to change your tier, just add the amount and we'll see the amount and a note from you during the survey):\nAdd $5 - Digital OST for the game\nAdd $10 - Unlock the Alternate playable Drifter\nAdd $15 - Additional Copy of the Game for any platform\nAdd $30 - Limited run t-shirt (no international yet)\nAdd $35 - SNES style physical box and manual (no international yet)\nAdd $42 - Limited Compact Print (11x14) (no international yet)\nAdd $60 - Printed Softcover Companion Art Book (no international yet)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter months of planning and writing and drawing and programming the vision for the project became vivid and succinct. That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered. Issues will come, as they always do in any long-term project, but I feel thoroughly prepared; I have the proper tools and skills and a large support network through our shared community space Glitch City which is bursting at the seams with excellent developers with vast wells of knowledge and years of experience prototyping, building, and releasing games. I feel incredibly lucky to be tapped into this community and to have such reliable friends willing to lend a hand with resources I may need in the future to complete this game.\n \nI've done what I can to get this far through some rather extreme health struggles, and I don't plan to stop. Heart and soul have been etched into this project and I hope it shines through.

It would be nice to continue development on our own but we have to be realistic, we've run into some costs which would be a challenge without the support of our Fans. We're asking for your help in crossing the finish line not alone as a small development team but together as a community.\n We would like to be clear in that Contagion is already at this time playable and currently in Closed Beta. All 3 Game-Modes and 4 of the 5 Maps are being streamed on Twitch.tv by testers daily. We're also updating and polishing the game daily. So why Kickstarter?\n Some people are confused why they shouldn't just wait till our Official Release on Steam to purchase a copy of the game. Well, those who pledge on Kickstarter for $15 (or more) will receive all previous tiers and some exclusive in game bonuses. Another incentive is a head start to play the game before the official release date, once Kickstarter money is approved. Please read the F.A.Q. for more information regarding this.\nWith this money we plan to put it to the following uses:\nCover various engine/license fees (engine, sound tools, software licenses, etc.)\nExpand our initial reach with marketing\nServer costs (you need somewhere to play!)\n$75,000 \u2022 While we\u2019re focused on delivering Contagion to both Mac & Linux users whether or not we reach this stretch goal, we have to take into account the extra fees for each platform. Your support will most definitely expedite our efforts and be appreciated by those waiting on said digital releases.\n$100,000 \u2022 We\u2019re eager to release free Downloadable Content (No Season passes here) which of course means we hope to continue development at no additional cost to you and the rest of the community, however the developers have families and while we\u2019re confident in the release of Contagion we know there are no guarantees. If we were to hit this stretch goal there would be nothing holding us back. We could then develop and deliver at a steady rate:\n4 New Weapons\n4 New Characters\n2 New Maps\n1 New Game-mode (Flatline - A wave based survival mode that fits our current theme and style)\n$125,000 \u2022 As with the previous stretch goal, there is a plan in place and as always we want to complete the work without taxing our community but knowing we can afford the work involved as well as the ability to set deadlines it sure doesn\u2019t hurt. Reaching this goal we will deliver:\n4 New Weapons\n4 New Characters\n2 New Maps\n1 New Game-mode (Cruise - This one involves vehicles and will require quite a bit of prototyping and balancing but is one we\u2019re excited to get started on)\n$150,000 \u2022 Continued future support of Contagion guaranteed with new maps, content, community feedback we can work with to improve the overall experience for as long as we can afford to. We of course speak of not just this stretch goal but that in which we can fund from our own earnings like we have throughout the development of Contagion thus far.\n$250,000 \u2022 We, like many others from the community wish to see Contagion reach consoles and reaching this goal will make this a strong possibility and one we plan to again whether we reach this stretch goal or not will pursue to the best of our abilities.\nThere is no way to pay directly through PayPal alone due to the protection Kickstarter/Amazone Payments provides which is why major Credit Cards are required.

The game challenges players to conserve ammo, rely on your team, and work together to survive the zombie onslaught. Players will face traditional (NPC) zombies as well as former teammates who have been passed on and joined the walking deceased, fueling the carnage to come. The game has been in development for two and a half years after recovering from a disagreement with the original co-founder thus the delay.\nFeatures\nPlay alone offline or online with friends (up to 8 players)\nMultiple game modes.\nPlay as either Human or Zombie\nRandomly generated weapon, ammo, and item placement.\nUnpredictable and intelligent zombie spawning system that adjusts to the current situation..\nA pathing and objective system that has you returning to the same map repeatedly without losing that fresh feel.\nFull Steamworks support. (Trading Cards, Achievements etc.)\nGameplay as a human\nFPS mechanics.\nEscape Game-mode: work together or alone to complete objectives and make it to a randomly generated escape point.\nExtraction Game-mode: Work together to find, protect, and extract helpless (NPC) survivors to a safe location.\nHunted Game-mode: With supplies low, fend off fellow survivors who would like nothing more than to be sifting through your pockets in this free for all, last man or woman standing game-mode.\nUse stealth, distractions, and strategies to covertly avoid zombies or take them down quietly now that ammo is a rare and valuable commodity.\nGameplay as a zombie\nCall upon and create your own zombie hoard to better break through fortifications and hunt your prey.\nSelectively let the AI take control of your character so as to blend in with the mindless hoard in an attempt to camouflage yourself and avoid being singled out while also having the jump on unsuspecting survivors..\nWhen the opportunity presents itself Grapple a player and sink your teeth into flesh causing both damage and a chance of infection which comes in handy if they manage to escape.\nZombie Vision enhances the senses allowing you to better see in the dark and track your prey.\nWe would also like to point out that Contagion will fully support Steam's Trading Card system and will release soon after launch.\nA sincere thank you email from the team for your contribution.

With us spread out on many continents the team quickly adopted a Virtual Developer model for the development of Contagion. \n This means that many of us have never met in person and yet call it with a straight face a true family. Of the few of us here at Monochrome we are based at locations such the US, UK, Germany, Sweden, Singapore, Romania, and Japan.

Rather than go to my local shoe repair shop to bring it back to life, I sat down at my sewing machine and started sewing up concepts for a new wallet.\nHaving the notion that a wallet is one of my most daily used essential, I felt I needed to make a quality wallet, something anyone could pull out and be proud of.\nMy thoughts throughout creating this wallet was making sure that I minimize the size of a traditional wallet without losing capacity like you would with a card holder.\nBeing able to fit a few cards, some cash & the ability to attach my phone while still having access to receiving calls. I also liked the idea of easy accessibility to my most frequently used credit card, so I could pay with just one hand while at the grocery store.\nSpec sheet, showing all over sizing specs!\nOriginally I did not think about RFID protection, until recently I had my credit card info stolen. Now I am not saying it was from an RFID scanner but I wanted to make sure it didn't happen again, so I added RFID blocking technology to The STOCK Wallet & MINI STOCK.\nAfter working on The STOCK Wallet for several months I started to get family and friends asking me about this \"wallet idea\" I was working on. Once showing them my progress they started to ask me if I was JUST going to make the one for myself. I replied with the remark of \"I only need ONE wallet!\". After they heard that, all of a sudden they needed a new wallet. Soon after request for their own STOCK wallets came e-mailing in!\nAfter crafting The STOCK Wallet, I had the notion to make an even smaller wallet! In turn, the MINI STOCK was born!\nEarly STOCK Wallet concepts!\nI have not been able to supply my family & friends with The STOCK Wallet & MINI STOCK yet because to create a few dozen wallets it's extremely time consuming and expensive. So I have decided to launch a Kickstarter and offer The STOCK Wallet to the WORLD!\nOffering the STOCK Wallet direct to consumer allows me to keep cost down & gives Kickstarters an awesome high end wallet, while keeping their cash in the STOCK Wallet.\nEmerging from prototypes The STOCK Wallet is born!\nAll funds raised through this project will go towards building  STOCK Wallets & MINI STOCK Wallets.\nGIDDY UP BROWN^    RAW INDIGO^   BLACK ON BLACK^\nThe plan is to keep all sourcing and manufacturing in my home town of Los Angeles. This way I am able to keep close tabs on all aspects of the STOCK Wallet brand. Working with local tanneries, custom elastic manufactures, & highly skilled craftsman to assemble our quality wallets.\nI ALSO WANT TO TAKE YOU ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

Our primary objectives are to tell a story even more compelling than Ultimas IV-VII, create a virtual world more interactive than Ultima VII, develop deep rich multi-player capabilities beyond combat akin to Ultima Online, and offer a bold new approach to integrate them with \u201cSelective Multi-Player\u201d.\nShroud of the Avatar is infused with rich storylines, deeply integrated into game play, developed by Best Selling Author Tracy Hickman and RPG legend Richard Garriott.\nPlayers will adventure in an interactive world where their choices have consequences, ethical paradoxes give them pause, and they play a vital part in weaving their own story into the immersive world and lore surrounding them.\nShroud of the Avatar is a Selective Multiplayer game, allowing players to choose how they want to play! Whether in Single-Player Offline mode or any of three online modes, the main quest line will provide greater than 40 hours of focused, story driven content.\nShroud of the Avatar can be played as an offline DRM free solo experience or online, where our servers will enable player to player transactions, group finding, patching, streaming of dynamic content, and exploit prevention.\nBuilt using the Unity Game Engine, Shroud of the Avatar will support Win/Mac/Linux for official launch.\nPlayers can specialize in a wide range of combat and non-combat skills, provided by a robust, classless skill system, and full-featured crafting and housing mechanics.

Under his leadership, RPG's evolved from simple dungeon crawls to immersive worlds where you could easily suspend your disbelief. You cared about the world and its people, and you cared about the actions and deeds you accomplished within that world.\nSince then, most every other RPG has focused more on level grinding than on \u201crole playing\u201d, which has been reduced to a few initial character choices. While advancements in graphics and sound have been phenomenal, in many ways the virtual worlds we play in have become less real. Less open. Less immersive.\nWith Shroud of the Avatar, Richard and his team will again reinvent the classic fantasy role-playing experience. Using state-of-the-art tools and technology, the game will focus on what made his seminal Ultima Series great. Once players are introduced to the game, they will discover their own story woven into the immersive world and lore surrounding them. Players may choose to follow the life of the adventurer or, if they prefer, focus on exploration and discovery. Players may even choose the life of a homesteader; either nestled within the safety of the settled lands, or on the dangerous but potentially lucrative frontier. The world is full of opportunities and challenges!\nThe familiar psychological profiling used to create your character, organically derived game-play responses to player behavior and fundamental virtues and consequence of actions will all play a huge role in Shroud of the Avatar. Players will be free to choose their path, but must then live with the consequences of their actions.\nShroud of the Avatar general features:\nFrom Lord British's Treatise on \"What is an Ultimate RPG?\":\nFully interactive virtual world - If it looks usable, it should do something\nDeep original fiction - Ethical parables, cultural histories, fully developed alternate language text\nPhysical game components will be available: Cloth map, fictional manuals, trinkets\nMultiplayer Online Game - which can also be played solo player / offline\nClassless character system:\nUnlike most RPGs, players will not be limited to the class they select at the beginning of the game.  We will be discussing this feature in more detail during an upcoming Developer Blog.\nPlayer housing:\nPlayer housing will live in the persistent shared world, so real estate will have location value. \nThe least expensive housing can be found in Villages, which offer the highest density of low-cost housing.  The core of a village will include basic services that will encourage players to both visit and settle in the area.  Villages are a great place for an ambitious adventurer to hang their hat. (Only a few thousand Village homes will be available to players in-game.)  \nTowns on the other hand, offer more protection and amenities than Villages. The larger amount of available services will further increase traffic flow to your home or business. Plots of land will be larger as well, allowing players to build bigger houses. Towns are an excellent place to start a business while affording moderate levels of safety. (Only a few hundred Town homes will be available to players in-game.)  \nA City provides substantial protection for players, with large, vital services to draw players to visit and spend their coin. Cities can be protected by large defensive structures like Tesla towers, and offer luxuries not found in Towns or Villages. Cities also have the largest and most valuable homesteads. Be aware though, that the most valuable properties are available to very limited number of players and will likely be in high demand! (Only a few dozen City homes will be available to players in-game.)  \nOnce a house is purchased, players will need to pay regular taxes on it of course. But as a special thank you to select Kickstarter supporters, all housing obtained by making a Kickstarter pledge of Citizen, Lord, Baron, Duke or Lord of the Manor will be tax free for life!  \nCrafting system that avoids busy work:\nCraft as a hobby or as a career! The results of all crafting elements have value as consumables and components in the combat system, as well as maintenance and upgrade elements for housing and cities. The crafting system will be a topic of discussion in one of our upcoming Developer Blogs.\nMeaningful PVP that also minimizes griefing:\nAn incentive-driven system will draw players into the challenge and intrigue of the PVP experience, whether they become the hunter or the hunted!\nScene based encounters:\nIn a nod to Garriott's early RPG works, Shroud of the Avatar is split up into a high-level overland map and adventure scenes. Scenes are generally re-playable and can be experienced solo or with others.\nVersions:\nShroud of the Avatar is currently planned for downloadable PC, Mac, and Linux.\nTo help Richard build his new masterpiece, a team of proven industry veterans has been assembled. The average team member has more than 10 years experience and a half-dozen shipped games to their credit. More than 50 titles have been shipped between the team, including almost a dozen games that reached number one on the sales charts.\nWe're not the only ones who are excited about Shroud of the Avatar!  \n\"As an Ultima fanatic, I'm kind of jittery excited about what's happening here.\" ~ Felicia Day, actress, writer, and producer of the web series The Guild\n\"Richard was an inspiration for our guild and has been a friend and supporter of ours for years, and us of him. We will definitely have a SotA presence.\" ~ Sean, aka Dragon, Guild Leader for The Syndicate\n\"So I'm hoping you will join with me in taking Richard up on this offer. That we should back him in SotA in creating and pioneering a new way of experiencing story in game. Because after all, Richard knows adventure.\" ~ Tracy Hickman, best-selling novelist and co-creator of the Dragonlance Novels and Adventure Modules.\n\"I am really excited to see what new innovations are in Shroud of the Avatar. I can not WAIT to play it!\" ~ Ernest Cline, author of New York Times Bestseller, Ready Player One\n\u201cRichard and I have known each other 26 years when I first joined up with a small little company called Origin Systems. We had a lot fun being the small rebel upstart company and made some games that are still remembered for defining or creating genres even today.  It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen Richard this energized about the world and game he is creating. Shroud of The Avatar, feels like the kind of game we would have made in the old days of Origin when we didn\u2019t answer to anyone and just made the best game we could with no interference. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about Crowd funding. I\u2019m backing and looking forward to being part of Lord British\u2019s next great adventure\u201d  ~ Chris Roberts, creator of the best-selling Wing Commander game series\n\"When I read that Lord British was going back to his roots to make \"The Shroud of the Avatar\" and kickstart it with the community, I was really excited and you should be too! SotA looks like it's going to be an incredible game!  ~ Min-Liang Tan, Chief Gamer and CEO of Razer/Edge\n\"I know how much Richard Garriott respects story, and that will set this game apart from the others. I know Shroud of the Avatar is going to tell a great story! \"I guarantee I will play. Try and stop me!\" ~ Warren Spector, renowned game developer and force behind the critically acclaimed and award winning games Ultima Underworld, System Shock, Thief, and Deus Ex.  \nAnd from our Friends at Ultima Codex!\nBe sure to pledge your support today and join our Champions in making Shroud of the Avatar a success!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEntertainment software development is always difficult. A successful game must work well feature-by-feature and be compelling and fun at all times to sustain player interest. \"Fun\" is very hard to define on paper, and is further complicated when tasked with integrating complex features that the players will find fulfilling. This iterative experimental process creates inherent risks in game development.\n\nWe are managing this risk with a number of careful processes. First our team is built around a core of industry experts, who individually have up to 30 years of game development experience. Additionally, we are using powerful, proven tools to mitigate development risks. Finally, we are staging development so that the most important and most risky features are developed first, while carefully containing the scope of the initial release so that feature bloat does not bury the project.\n\nWhile game development remains inherently risky, this team is qualified and dedicated to drive this project to successful conclusion with skill and passion.
