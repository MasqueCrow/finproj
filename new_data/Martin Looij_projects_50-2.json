Store the bone or add it to a dino display you're preparing in your lab!\n Each turn, you have three energy points to spend moving around the site, collecting plaster, digging through layers of terrain, and extracting fossils. \n As you remove Terrain tiles from the board, you claim the tile for the precious fragments (eggshells, footprints, and amber) found on them. They can be used to buy helpful Tools or Supplies. \n Sometimes you'll find lost rock hammers in the dirt... return them to the display to learn game-changing skills as a reward! \n You can claim a dinosaur to your lab as long as you have at least one of its required bones. Your lab can only hold one dinosaur at a time, so you must score your dinosaur before taking another.  \n The plaster pool works as a timer for the game. Each time it's exhausted, an Event takes place that may have positive or negative effects on the game. Once the last pool runs out, game end is trigged. You earn points for the Tools and Supplies you've claimed and the different sets of dinosaurs you've collected throughout the game.  \n Ready to dig in deep?

The Rook, never one to shy away from the precarious, has decided to take down a string of casinos. But this is no office job - tougher safes, tightened security - and perhaps worst of all, you'll be working during the day!  The team will have to dress-up (or dress-down) to go unnoticed in the casino crowds.  You'll need to avoid making a commotion or taking too much heat before cracking the safe and escaping through whatever insane plan the Rook has dreamed up. \nThe original Burgle Bros was Kickstarted back in 2015 and since has become a sleeper hit in the boardgame world, winning various awards and multiple glowing reviews.  It even snuck past the guards to make it to the top 200 games on BoardGameGeek! The game have even been converted to a top-rated app, available on iOS, Android and Steam.\n Burgle Bros 2 is a 1-4 player cooperative game that plays in 60 min.\n Burgle Bros 2: The Casino Capers is not an expansion - it's a whole new game with all new ways to run a successful heist. While you'll still need to work together to explore the building and avoid getting caught, nearly every aspect of Burgle Bros has been reinvented for an even more exciting caper.\n Gear - Each players now has their own unique kit of tools that can be used during ANY player's turn.  You're no longer forced to wait until your turn before you can jump in and save the day, adding a whole new level of coordinated plays.\n New Rooms - The Pool, Blackjack table, Buffet, Dance Floor - casino rooms are a new mix of crazy and challenging effects that will keep you on your toes.\n Hidden Perks & Pitfalls - Chips are placed on rooms throughout the casino for additional one-time effects - some of them reward bold moves, and others punish them!\n Doors - In addition to walls, locked doors block your path on the casino floor.  The team can crack doors easy - the real question is, should you leave them open? \n Hunt Mode - No more moving slowly and cautiously during the heist.  Take too long and the bouncers will start hunting you. \n Finales - Cracking the safe is only step one. Now each games concludes with a big twist ending. What will the team have to do to make it out with a grand piano slowing you down, or with the swat team on your tail?\n Unlock New Content - Each time you complete a Finale, open the next sealed scenario, filled with new challenges, and new tools to get the job done.\nThis list is just scratching the surface.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date.

Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience.

Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

Mike DePasquale stepped up and answered a random Facebook post to produce a ton of player trayz, (and FAST!) with his buddy Oscar Valera when we needed for review. John Popson (of Effin Cool Minis) - made the best \"where did you get those??\" minis and made sure our models were spot on.\nLORE/PUZZLES/WEBSITE - Astrid Dalmady was a key force on our team during development, helping shape this game from the ground up, art finding (especially the Darkness!), rule breaking, lore writing!

It is not a dwarf, nor does it seem to be one of the ghosts who haunt the realm of Eldervale. It forms itself out of whatever earth and sticks and rocks lay about. When I try to strike it with my hammer, it simply collapses in a cloud of debris, and my hammer harmlessly strikes the ground. But my relief at dispersing it is short lived, for when I turn around, there it is again. It is always watching\u2026 so I will call it the Watcher.\nThe Watcher may not be a ghost, but it must be communicating with them. The spirits always know where to find us and how to block our actions. The Watcher only watches, but I fear it is the true source of danger.\nI have tried to dispel the Watcher with magic \u2013 burn it with fireballs, strike it with lightning, flee from it in liquid form \u2013 all to no avail.

To send us a message please click here or on this banner:\nIt's rare to be able to work on something you love.\nThis is what happened with On the Underground. Long out of print, it was a favourite in our gaming group and when we realized that the rights were available, we reached out to Sebastian Bleasdale and, well, here we are!\nThe massive network of London Underground stations makes up one of the most complex transportation systems in the world, and On the Underground challenges you to develop it. \nBuild the most successful lines, connect them to landmarks and attract passenger traffic! \nOn the Underground is a game for players who love to create.\nWhile seemingly a simple game, the strategic depth takes you beyond other network-building games such as Ticket to Ride, Thurn & Taxis and Through the Desert.\nBesides each game being different due to the on-board objectives, the Passenger introduces a singular challenge to each turn of the game, inviting you to participate (and earn points) even when it is not your turn.\nThis edition of On the Underground includes the all-new Berlin map, a challenging change of pace for those who have played the original London one, which has also been updated to match the real-life Underground and improve gameplay.\nBesides adding Berlin and improving the art and graphic design, we took the opportunity to perfect the contents of the game, and even more so for the Deluxe edition that we hope to create with your support!\nWe decided early on to include more than one Passenger shape options, and thus the five custom-shaped tokens were born. Three of them (wheelchair user, elderly and pregnant) were kindly provided by Ian O'Toole and Alban Viard.\nIn addition, we felt the need to do even more to thank you for your support, and with  something truly special. That is why we created the transparent acrylic token, and we gave it a shape that may be familiar to our previous backers...\nFinally, we decided to wrap the whole package up in something even more \"Deluxe\", a beautiful slip case that will have your box shining amongst others on your shelf - literally. The wraparound UV coating on the water-colour graphical elements gives it an elegant sheen that stands out.\nThe Deluxe edition will be available through this campaign (including any retail backers - see below) and through events where we participate.\nWe also wanted to make sure that we offer the basic edition of the game to those who do not want improved components. There are no other differences between the two editions.\nNote that the included rulebook for any basic edition copies fulfilled as part of this campaign may depict Deluxe components.\nIn On the Underground, players compete to build the most valuable and convenient transportation network in London or Berlin. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.\n At the beginning of each turn, 4 Destination cards are facing up, corresponding to stations on the map. A player\u2019s turn consists of taking four actions, followed by the Passenger\u2019s movement.\nAfter the player\u2019s turn, the Passenger token is moved along built lines and avoiding empty track spaces as much as possible, in order to reach 1 or 2 Destination stations.\n The Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, and then play passes to the next player in clockwise order.\nPlayers score points in two ways:\n\u2022 By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by building a circular line in London, or by collecting Landmark tiles in Berlin.\n\u2022 By having the Passenger use their lines when moving.\nThe game is over after all Destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns.\nThe player that has earned the most points is the winner, having built the most valuable network On the Underground!\nYou can download the rules of the game here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026):\n On_the_Underground_rules_EN_016_compressed.pdf\nPlease download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 39 USD / 52 CAD / 57 AUD / 39 CHF / 4288 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe can also not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid. Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list.\nWe expect to have tracking for the USA, but not for anywhere else. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. We do not expect to be sending tracking codes when the games are shipped.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or at any other convention.\n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained.\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for the period of the campaign. It includes costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nEU: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD\nUSA: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD\nWorldwide: 14 USD. Real cost: At least 18-28 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRetailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/on-the-underground-london-berlin/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available only to retailers which have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. Stores with event space will be prioritized and all entities and locations will be verified.\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where there no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order the game, should there be any stock available, for at least 6 months after fulfillment has commenced.\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: We pledge that, along with the exception of a limited number of retail backer and convention copies, your games will arrive long before the game (the basic edition) is available through wide distribution.\nSPIEL availability: Should production be completed in time, we plan to airship a limited number of copies to Essen, where we will be selling them. As mentioned above, we can not offer pickup there or at any other convention, and we can not guarantee availability.\nGame Design: Sebastian Bleasdale\nIllustration: Viktor Csete\nGraphic Design: Viktor Csete\nRules Editing: Paul Grogan\nTrailer: Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4\nTabletopia Implementation: Viktor Csete\nSpecial Thanks: JKLM & Rio Grande Games, Teppo Saarinen, the JunaCon crew, Ian O'Toole, Alban Viard, Toni Heinonen, Kira Peavley, David Turczi, John Albertson, Adrian & Sandie Whipp, Brett Gilbert, Matthew Dunstan, Tom Vasel, Luke Hector, Matt Evans, Joel Wright, Martyn Poole, Derek & Lizzie Funhouser, Nick Welford, Antti Punavaara, and the many, many playtesters that helped  create (and re-create!)

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\nA link to the Pledge Manager for Late Pledges will be coming soon!\nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com. \nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. \nWe successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. In the spring of 2018 we Kickstarted To The Barricades!, adding solo and CoOp play and two additional Quests, which were delivered in the spring of 2019.\nNew Horizons\nAfter the climactic battle in Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World, the Champions are dispersed by the forces of wild magic. One awakens in a far realm of endless sands. Another discovers himself in a strange new city where he may learn the fate of his people.\nThe world of Thunderstone Quest is even larger than we could ever imagine. It's time to explore these New Horizons.\nBack the campaign TODAY to begin or continue your Thunderstone Quest adventure!\nDue to the overwhelming support of the community, the $400,000 Stretch Goal has been Achieved! \nWe will add the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all New Horizons Rewards (and Rewards that include New Horizons)! Congratulations to everyone who helped rally the community to reach this HUGE goal!\nBecause of Kickstarter's rules, we cannot change the description of the Rewards to note that the 4th Level Heroes have been added.\n(Backers who choose the \"Your Inventory is Full\" Reward will be issued a $25 credit in the Pledge Manager)\nThis Kickstarter features two new Quests: Quest 8: Vengeful Sands and Quest 9: Clockwork Destiny, both designed by Bryan Reese with story written by Brett Satkowiak. \nAll Quests including Vengeful Sands and Clockwork Destiny can be played in either Barricades Mode or Competitive Mode. \nThis campaign also includes a special promo pack for Barricades Mode: Ezuzrius' Lair (estimated MSRP $9.99) included in the New Horizons Reward (and all Rewards that contain the New Horizons reward)! Ezuzrius' Lair is a Kickstarter Early Access release, meaning that Kickstarter backers will get this promotional pack before it is available for sale. At this time we do not have a planned retail release for this item. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - New Horizons which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, Champion + Barricades + New Horizons which combines all three Kickstarter Rewards into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes everything we make for Thunderstone Quest.\nYour Inventory is Full!\n(If you have a Thunderstone Quest base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and did not back To the Barricades, you will be able to add it as an Add-on in the Pledge Manager with your New Horizons pledge.)\nWe are also offering a limited quantity of Expedited Rewards. Because of the long lead time for production of the new content in this Kickstarter we will not be able to deliver the new content until next year. But we have set aside a limited quantity of Champion and Barricades components so that we can swiftly manufacture enough units for delivery this November! \nNew Horizons and Add-ons to Expedited orders will ship next year with the rest of the Rewards.\nNote for Expedited Backers: After the campaign ends, you can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Expedited components. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status.\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your shipment Expedited.\nThis campaign also includes a special Add-on: 4th Level Heroes! The 4th Level Heroes bring more power and abilities to the game.\nNote to all Backers:  The Champion/To the Barricades! boxes contain space to hold these two new Quests and they will be shipped without the individual boxes shown in the graphics for this campaign. If you would like to order the boxes for these Quests they'll be available for a small fee as Add-ons in the Pledge Manager.\nNote to Non-English Speakers: All the contents of this campaign are in English only. AEG is working with a team of international partners on future campaigns for non-English language support which we'll be announcing later in 2019.\n Benefits to this Campaign: \nYou will get the product at a discount to the suggested retail price ($39.99 x 2 Quests + an estimated $9.99 for Ezuzuris' Lair)\nYou'll get the New Horizons content before the normal retail release\nYou'll get the Ezuzrius' Lair Promo Pack\nYou'll get the 4th Level Heroes Add-on\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward you will receive Kickstarter Exclusive Content\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward and/or the To the Barricades Reward you'll get the large boxes & storage system with those Rewards\nQualified Brick & Mortar Retail Stores please see the Kick It Here section below for details on the Kick It Here Reward. \nVengeful Sands Previews\nWe are pleased to showcase some of the cards from Quest 8: Vengeful Sands here on the Kickstarter Campaign page.

In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nIn Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people (up to 6 people with To The Barricades content!) to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.  \nYou can add funds to your pledge as described in the graphic above which will be automatically credited to your account in the Pledge Manager. Or, you can wait until the Pledge Manager opens and purchase Add-ons directly, paying the balance due on your order in the Pledge Manager instead. There is no difference in price or availability. Altering your pledge on Kickstarter is convenient and it helps us grow the total amount pledged which has a positive effect for attracting more Backers.\nTo the Barricades (not shown)\nYou will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping & Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward.\nEpic Thunderstone Support for Champion: \nThis is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion Rewards. The Champion Reward does not include an extra copy of every card for Epic Thunderstone use.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play invented by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook. You can read those rules in the Rulebook link above!\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll the content in To The Barricades! and all new content for New Horizons in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nYou'll need a base copy of Thunderstone Quest (Champion, Adventurer or Retail) to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the base game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\n4th Level Heroes\nNOTE: The campaign has achieved it's $400,000 Stretch Goal and this Add-on will automatically be included in every New Horizons Reward! You do not need to pay extra to get this Stretch Goal benefit!\nThis is a special deck of cards which adds a 4th experience level to every Hero in the game from Quests 1-9 as well as the extra Heroes released with the Champion box. There are over fifty 4th Level Heroes in this package!\nThere will be 2 copies of each 4th level hero, one for use in normal Competitive and Barricades Mode play, and a second for use in Epic Thunderstone mode.\nQuest 2: Total Eclipse of the Sun\nThis Add-on is for people who have purchased the Retail Base Set and did not back either of the previous Kickstarters. The Champion Reward contains a Quest which is Kickstarter Exclusive and is not available in retail stores as a stand-alone purchase. You can buy that Quest via this Add-on.\nUpdate: 17 June: Based on a suggestion from backer @Chris, we're upgrading this Add-on to include all the additional promo cards added to the Champion Reward during the 1st Kickstarter so that you will be able to get every card released for Thunderstone Quest in the Champion unit if you get this Add-on, the Retail Base and the retail release of Quest 4 and Quest 5!\nThis change will add about 50 more cards to this Add-on at no additional charge!\nPlease Note: If you have or are buying the Champion Reward, or if you bought the Adventurer Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, you already have this Quest.\nThe Quest will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the New Horizons pledge level to order this Add-on.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern. It is substantially smaller than the board included in the main game. \nThe Playmat is double-sided. One side is the \"day\" layout for competitive play. And the reverse is the \"night\" side with spaces for the Barricades board overlays, showing the Village partially destroyed. The \"night\" side is intentionally darker than the day side to reflect the perilous condition of the Village!\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within either the Champion or the To The Barricades box, box, rolled up. The length is 300 mm.\nPremium Sleeves\nThese are AEG Premium Sleeves, also used in Mystic Vale, Edge of Darkness, and Valley of the Kings Premium. They have an excellent reputation for durability!\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 2 more packs to sleeve the all the new content in To the Barricades! including randomizers, Epic support cards, the 5th and 6th player support and other cards provided for Barricades Mode.\nYou will need 2 packs total to sleeve all the content in New Horizons.\nTo sleeve everything you'll need 8 packs of sleeves.\nYou can store all 9 Quests, starting cards, Kickstarter exclusive cards, and Epic support cards, sleeved, in the Champion and To the Barricades boxes. Space is also available for the rolled up playmat and all other game components. \nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected an Expedited reward you will receive your Champion and To The Barricades boxes in an expedited early shipment in November. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nNext year when the rest of the Kickstarter Rewards for this campaign are delivered Expedited backers will get all the rest of their order including any Add-ons they have ordered in a 2nd shipment.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nUnited States & Canadian Backers: As you may know the Administration is preparing to implement a 25% import tariff on goods shipped to the US from China. We have estimated the impact these tariffs will have on the importation of your Rewards and have adjusted the costs of the Rewards and the Shipping & Handling estimates accordingly. There will be no additional charge made for the tariffs if and when they are imposed.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA.\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons at 33lbs/15kg. The following estimates are for both the regular and Expedited Rewards.\nThe following chart also provides estimates for shipping Your Inventory is Full without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Your Inventory Is Full at 47lbs/21kg\nUSA: Shipping & Handling included\nCANADA: $15\nEUROPE: Shipping & Handling included to Germany. $15 to EU + UK, Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $20 to Australia. $60 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $60\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping New Horizons without Add-Ons.

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nThe Kick It Here program is open to brick & mortar retail stores who generate a meaningful percentage of their sales from tabletop games. Kick It Here products may not be resold on the internet. AEG reserves the right to disqualify any backer from this promotion at its sole discretion.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to with the same Shipping & Handling costs as regular Backers.\nYou have to back this project at the Kick It Here Reward level to get the Kick It Here pricing and delivery. \nIf you select the $66 Kick It Here Reward level you will be eligible to make the full $195 purchase for 6 units of New Horizons in the Pledge Manager. The $66 you pay on Kickstarter will automatically be credited to your account as a pre-payment.\nAccess to Champion & Barricades Rewards: You will be able to order the Champion and Barricades Rewards as Add-ons to your Kick It Here order. However, due to the high cost of manufacturing these items we cannot offer a discount to the Kickstarter price; your price for Champion will be $120 per unit, and your price for Barricades will be $60. Due to the extremely large size of these boxes and their substantial weight they are usually shipped individually which means there's no meaningful savings on shipping for bulk orders.\nAccess to the Neoprene Playmat, Epic Support, 4th Level Heroes, Quest 2, and AEG Premium Sleeves: All of these Add-ons will be available for purchase via the Kick It Here program with a small discount from the Add-on prices as listed. You will be able to view these prices in the Pledge Manager.\nPlease Note: If you do not qualify as a brick & mortar retail store, or you fail to complete your order in the Pledge Manager, AEG can only refund you 92% of the amount you pledge. The other 8% is lost to unrecoverable Kickstarter fees.\nGroup Buys: AEG does not do group buys or offer increased discounts on Reward prices or shipping for multiple orders.\nKick It Here orders will ship at the same time as the other Kickstarter Rewards.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nByan Reese & Satkowiak for design and writing for Quest 8 & 9\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nErick Santz, producer for animated game segment in the campaign video\nJohnny Stone, voice work for the main campaign video\nHonor at Last by Hector Posser; Production music courtesy of www.epidemicsound.com \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Then they'll begin picking & packing orders for pickup by the carriers. When the carrier picks up you may or may not receive an email telling you that an order is scheduled to ship. Orders will ship as the Depots process the orders, which may not all happen at the same time so some people may get orders while others are still unshipped.\n\n3: When all shipments from all Depots have finished, the logistics partner will receive tracking numbers for all packages, which are then transmitted to us. Until that step, we . When we receive the tracking information we will email all customers. We will also upload those tracking numbers into the pledge manager which MAY trigger an additional email notification to you that your order has \"shipped\".

Chinese factories close in January for the Lunar New Year, when many workers return home to their ancestral villages, celebrate with family & friends, and then travel back to their places of employment. This year, the Chinese Government has declared that the Lunar New Year holiday period will be extended, and movement inside of China has been restricted. All of the factories that we work with have been impacted.\n\nAs a result of these policies, work we expected to be underway at this time on your Kickstarter Rewards is on hold. When the factories re-open and travel is again permitted we expect that there will be a substantial backlog of work which will further impact the timing of the delivery of your Rewards.\n\nDue to the fluid and uncertain nature of the Chinese manufacturing infrastructure we cannot at this time provide firm estimates of when your Rewards will ship to you. We will continue to update you as we know more about the timing of production and fulfillment. Today, we believe that Rewards will be delayed at least one month from our original estimates.\n\nWe're sincerely sorry for these delays and the ripple effects they'll cause for other projects in the Thunderstone Quest and Edge of Darkness lines. We're working with our Chinese factories to ensure that when the restart happens we'll be able to communicate back to all our backers what our revised timelines will be.\n\nYou can always see the most current information we have about our Kickstarter projects by visiting our Kickstarter page:\n\n\n\nThis page will be updated as soon as we have new information on any project.\n\nIf after reading this message you have further questions please contact and we'll be happy to help!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "January Update", "update_content": "Champions of Thunderstone!\nThis Update will serve as notice of two developments. \nFirst, the Expedited portions of Expedited orders have been shipped to backers who processed their orders before the Expedited window was closed.

Instead of playing as only 1 civilization in 3 hours, each player could now play as 3 civilizations in 30 minutes!\nWith the help of the unique gaming mechanism, the set-up for every game is greatly different, providing a high replay-ability to players. During the game, players will rise civilization to collect resources, research technologies, build wonders, and prepare for war. Eventually, every civilization may become less powerful as the population may drop in different ways, or simply because the era is changing. (Not all civilization can adapt to a new era, as we know it from history.) It will be time for you to raise another kingdom! The new kingdom can inherit the advantages of the former civilization to continue the legend in the game. As the rise and fall of 3 empires, a unique set of the civilizations of yours will finally arise! \nPLAY\n\nAt the beginning of a game, 8 action cards are shuffled to form a time track in random order, then place the permanent action card at the upper left of the time track.\nIn each player turn, the player take actions by assigning worker tokens to the action slots. Only the 3 actions on the permanent action card AND the 3 actions right under the permanent action card are available to choose.\nWhen all players have finished their turn, the current round ends. Move the permanent action card to the right by 1 card slot when a round ends. As a result, 1 action card of the previous round will become unavailable, and 1 new action card will be available for the next round, creating a new era!\nBesides taking actions to develop empire, each player could rise civilization card to gain more powerful abilities and reset population(number of workers). Civilization cards you own are stacked to show your current civilization with its main ability, and the legacy ability of your previous civilizations.\nRising new civilization is very powerful, but the number of civil. card each player could own is limited to 3. So the timing of \"Rise and Fall\" is a critical decision to make.\nAfter 6 rounds, whoever has the most points wins! \nFor detail rules, please check out the following links:\nDownload / Game Trial\nRule Book v1.5 (English) PDF\nRegola v1.5 (Italian) PDF\n Regel v1.5 (German) PDF \n R\u00e8gle v1.5 (French) PDF \nTry it free on Tabletopia ! \nNote: All the above rule books are not the printed version. \n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

Exploriana is easy to learn but filled with strategy and perfect for all ages, 8 and older. \nLate in the 19th century steam has replaced sail and the once distant uncharted lands are within grasp! Faraway countries are brought ever closer to hand and explorers equipped with as many charts and maps as they can carry, set out determined to update them!\nTake your place in history! Send your team of explorers out into the world and guide them as they plunge deep into steamy jungles, trek across vast tracts of Savannah and ascend towering peaks, courting danger to discover great wonders!\nFacing peril at every turn, your brave explorers will search for fantastic animals, ancient cities, new varieties of orchids and treasures of extreme beauty! \nFame and fortune await the triumphant but many expeditions are foiled by unexpected hazards, some are lost, never to be seen again!\nExploriana is a tense and exciting game filled with complexity, that you will want to play again and again!\nStandard and deluxe edition stretch goals! With the initial funding goal achieved we will begin upgraded both editions of Exploriana with some awesome enhancements!  \nRemember that the deluxe edition will receive ALL stretch goals, standard & deluxe!\nA note on the deluxe version stretch goals .  \nThe deluxe stretch goals are only unlocked with the total number of deluxe level pledge backers.  \nThe stretch goals for the deluxe version of Kickstarter will not be available in the retail version of Exploriana. The only way to get the deluxe edition of Exploriana is by pledging at the 'First Class Traveller' reward level.  \nAs with the standard edition stretch goals, more stretch goals for the deluxe edition of Exploriana will be revealed once the last one has been unlocked. \nBoth the standard edition and deluxe edition stretch goals will be included in the deluxe edition.\nClick here to become a fan on BoardGameGeek of Exploriana! \n Retweet us here to unlock the twitter goal!\nShare our Facebook post here!\nExploriana packs a lot of game into its box! The standard edition includes the following:\nGameplay Summary\nIn Exploriana YOU decide the fate of a team of brave explorers!\nSetting off into far flung corners of the globe, the explorers throw themselves deep into the unknown, each time hoping to discover new contributions to science and history!\nThe discoveries your explorers make will provide you with victory points and the player with the most victory points at the end of the game will be the winner.\nExploriana incorporates several cool game mechanics:\n\u2022 Resource management (money is the major resource in the game)  \n\u2022 Variable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\n\u2022 Push your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards to make discoveries and avoiding hazards)\n\u2022 Hand management (the players get to choose various explorer cards with special abilities that they can use during the game)\n\u2022 Set collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards could deliver more points)\n\u2022 Worker placement (where to send your explorers is a crucial decision) \nSetup\nExploriana is simple to set up. Each player is given some starting funds, two mission cards, to try and complete during the course of the game, and a guide token to help them on their way. \nExploriana is played over a variable number of rounds, further split into 4 phases. \nPhase 1 - Recruit explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach round a number of explorers are laid out. Each explorer has their own special ability and each player gets to pick one to add to their team.\nExperienced players may choose to use the alternate recruitment rule that eliminates the need for the recruit explorers phase. The players start the game by drafting a full team of explorers to use throughout the game.\nPhase 2 - Send Explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nThere are three regions to explore in Exploriana: South America, Africa and the Far East, each of the regions is more dangerous than the last. \nThe players now decide which of the three regions they will send their explorers too. \nIn renown order, players take turns placing one of their explorers until every player has placed two explorers.\nPhase 3 - Explore regions\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach of the three region decks has its own unique deck of cards and the decks are packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries.\nEach deck contains five types of discovery cards! \nEvery card has a unique piece of art showing what type of discovery can be found.\nA region is explored by revealing cards one at a time, simulating an expedition pushing ever deeper into the wilderness. \nAs a player reveals a discovery card there is a chance a hazard is found on that discovery card! \nIf a player should reveal any three hazards of the same type, or all three different hazards while exploring, then the expedition is lost and the cards are shuffled back into the region deck to be found in furture expiditions. \nRevealing up to four discovery cards allows a player to make a single pick.\nA pick is taking a set of animals or a single treasure, orchid, map or location card.\nIf they are brave or lucky enough to have revealed five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra pick!\nPhase 4 - End of round\nAt the end of each round the players check to see if any deck is empty, and replace any region deck that is with its respective reserve, which will then trigger the final round of the game.\nVictory\nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points.\nThe discoveries the players make award renown, wealth or victory points, and some even give the player a combination of awards!\nFOR A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE RULES PLEASE DOWNLOAD THEM FROM HERE.\nThe above is a brief overview of Exploriana.

It allows us to bring each company's unique skill set into the fold, ensuring we have the combined expertise and experience to make this campaign a resounding success.  \nThe team includes:\nRobin Elliott of Triple Ace Games Ltd. Triple Ace Games have been making games for 10 years and brings a wealth of knowledge to the team. Having successfully run 17 Kickstarter campaigns they have the know how to successfully deliver a KS project. Robin brings his knowledge of graphic design and manufacturing to the team.\nDicky Duerden of Counters Out Ltd. Counters out is the publishing arm of Chance & Counters, the Bristol-based board game cafe. Exploriana will be their first published game. Dicky is our community manager. Keeping our backers and potential backers up to date with all the news and information on our campaign as it develops.\nMiles Ratcliffe and David Inker of Chaos Publishing Ltd have brought Exploriana to the team. Miles is the game designer on this project. Having devised this amazing game he has play-tested Exploriana to exhaustion, honing its amazing game play. David  is in charge of the admin and creative content.\nRichard Dearing is our superb artist. He spent many hours creating the fabulous artwork for our game and we all think he did an awesome job!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three companies involved in with the Exploriana Campaign are experienced with Kickstarter and the fulfilment process, each having run several Kickstarter campaigns in the past, Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date.\n\nThe game is complete, and we have already self-funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well-known and well-established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery alongside our fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product.\n\nBrexit is a concern, of course. We are planning on using fulfilment centres within the EU to limit any impact that it may have on the campaign, in this way we don't envisage any major problems to overcome.\n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges we run into can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Benefactor", "descp": "A big thank you from us for showing your support for Exploriana.\nJoin us on our Kickstarter expedition and follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

By charging shipping after the campaign, we can properly assess the final weights and measures of our games, as well as group backers in such a way to maximize utility and ensure you get the lowest shipping cost. We will cover all customs and duties, but our low pledge tiers and small margins prevent us from providing free shipping.\nThe following table includes estimated shipping costs provided by stamps.com (for US backers) and Spiral Galaxy Games for our European and international backers. These are not final costs, but rather estimates.  The true and final shipping cost will be charged after the campaign.\nApproximate Shipping Rates\nCanadian backers. Starlit Citadel Games will ship orders that are larger than the retail game if we get sufficient Canadian orders.  Spiral Galaxy Games will currently handle delivery of the retail game.\nEU backers.  We are EU friendly.  Products ship to EU backers from within the EU and we handle all customs and administrative fees.\nTaxes\nEach backer is responsible for paying their share of the sales taxes for their pledge.  Since we are based out of Texas, we are required by law to collect sales tax from any Texas backers. Some European countries also require that we collect VAT. All taxes and shipping costs will be assessed and collected after the campaign via Pledge Manager.\nIt\u2019s our goal to be as transparent and fair as possible with regard to shipping. No one likes to pay shipping, and we are committed to doing our best to minimize its impact on everyone.\nWe'd like to thank the following people and organizations for all they've done to help bring Zoo-ography together.\nEric Jones, Marco Cervone, and Brian Edger for the hours of playtesting.\nMarc Hampson for his incredible artistic talents.\nPaul Olson for his superb work on our opening video.\nJennica Schwartzman for lending her beautiful voice to our video. \nStephen Selego with Panda Game Manufacturing for all the help and guidance preparing for manufacturing our games.\n Kristi Weyland with Peace, Love, & Games for the incredible preview video.\nFor the timely and inspirational reviews thank you, Dianne N. with Women Like Board Games, Eric Yurko with What's Eric Playing?, George Jaros with GJJ Games, and Steph Elizondo with Settler of the Boards \n Tabletop Artisan's Workshop, Dallas Games Marathon, DFW Nerd Night, and Dallas Designer Group got hosting us over these last few months while we demoed endlessly.\nDerek Funkhouser with The Board Game Spotlight for giving us a platform to promote our game. \n Gerald King III for the opportunity to be on your Kickstarter interview!\nMembers of the Zoo-ography Community Page for their contributions to the game's direction. \nOur Bridges to Nowhere backers for taking a chance on our little game.\nOur Families for their endless patience and support for our dream.\n...and Joshua Geimer whose efforts put us on the map and shaped our fledgling company.\nAnd of course, ALL OF YOU, our backers!!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is an ever evolving market, and what games may have been a sure fire win even last year, may not be on anyone's radar today. With larger and larger game companies taking up greater share of the market, small indie board game publishers like ourselves can often be left in the dust - especially if our campaigns lack the polish backers have come to expect. While the ever rising bar is good for Kickstarter, it presents new challenges. With more up front capital needed and a demand for near completed games prior to launching, the cost of failure can be significant.\n\nWe at Doomsday Robots recognize the risks involved in pursuing our passion of making board games and are ready to rise to the challenge. Market analysis is a huge part of what we do prior to deciding which game to create and bring to publication, We want to make sure that not only is our investment secure, but that we can meet the demands of this amazing Kickstarter market. As such we've done our homework to minimize costs and risks to our backers.\n\nWe aren't perfect, and we've made mistakes in the past, but we never let that prevent us from doing right by our backers - a commitment we will keep today. We welcome feedback for how we can improve, and indeed listening to our backers have helped us to be a better company.\n\nThe biggest risk we face is the same that most publishers face - ever changing shipping costs. We've taken definitive steps to minimize this risk with an unprecedented level of transparency with our backers so that we can support one another in not only the successful creation of this game, but ensuring the costs to deliver it aren't unbearable to either party. As such we've moved the shipping charges to be collected after the campaign so we can truly minimize the costs with the foreknowledge of how many games we need, and exactly where they are going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Print and Play", "descp": "Receive a download link for the official print and play of Zoo-ography after the campaign and once all art assets are finalized.\nINCLUDES:\nZoo-ography Digital Print and Play Files", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["201 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Zoo-ography", "descp": "*The Game*\nReceive one copy of Zoo-ography Retail Edition including the Kickstarter exclusive Panda meeple with all applicable stretch goals.

PLEASE NOTE MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED.\nMonumental is a massive board game for 1 to 4 players where you\u2019ll compete with your opponents to lead your prestigious civilization through the ages.\nThe game starts with the Classic era (antiquity), will cross the Medieval times to end up in the Modern industrial age. Through all these ages, you\u2019ll have to assemble your military forces to conquer new territories, focus on scientific research to enhance your civilization\u2019s abilities, build breathtaking wonders to harness their unique advantages, and develop your cultural policies to guide your people to victory. The fate of your civilization is upon you!\nEach civilization has its own deck of cards with cultural specificities, as well as an army to explore and conquer the provinces on the board. On each turn, you\u2019ll be able to draw and activate cards, combining their effects to develop your civilization and conquer the world. But you\u2019re not alone in this race, as your opponents will try and outrun you as soon as they can. A game of Monumental plays over different eras, each of them featuring new cards to acquire and use. At the very beginning of the game, you control a small town in some remote country that nobody has ever heard of. Yet by the end of the game, thanks to the many cards that you will acquire, all will admire your monumental city, the jewel of a glorious nation!\nAs war is inevitable, you\u2019ll need to lead your troops to combat when necessary. Fight the barbarians or protohistoric Free Cities to loot their resources, then wage war against your opponents! Each civilization comes with 14 army units - either nicely illustrated tokens (Classic edition) or finely sculpted unique miniatures (Deluxe edition) that you\u2019ll be able to deploy on a richly illustrated modular game board to take control of the world. On the other side of your army, send your explorers to crawl new provinces, exploit new resources or even obtain new ones from various marketplaces in order to reinforce your city production capacity and speed up your evolution. Not a warmonger? Then maybe focus on Knowledge to enhance your cards\u2019 abilities and gain more resources. Build Libraries, Laboratories, Colleges and other scientific buildings to educate your people. Then use this Knowledge to gain powerful cards that will allow you to do more actions in a single turn. Another solution would be to focus on Culture: various actions you take in the game will develop the culture of your empire, which in turn allows you to deploy special Cultural Policies with permanent advantages.\nAnd of course, what would be a civilization without its wonders? The Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, the Great Wall\u2026 all have powerful in-game effects that will allow your empire to rise to glory. Building wonders is another way to assert your dominance over your opponents in Monumental, and a great way to show your greatness to the world.\nThe path to glory will not be simple. You need to find the proper balance between all these possibilities to achieve victory\u2026 and this will take time. But after all, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day!\nEach Civilization comes with a set of cards comprising common buildings along with a unique building and knowledge card. The basic buildings of your city will give you the basic resources: the fort will provide Military, the Library will provide Science and the Work Camp will provide Production.\nA unique Knowledge card as well as 5 Cultural Policies complete the cultural distinction between civilizations. A Warlord card, working along with the corresponding unit on the board, also gives a unique and special conquest power to their owner.\nKnowledge cards that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them.\nIn Monumental, the cards that you will buy and activate in your city are the key to victory. You must find the proper balance between the different types of cards, as each of them will give you special advantages. Managing your deck and anticipating the cards to come will also give you the upper hand over your opponents.\nAs the game progresses through its 3 ages (Classic \u2013 Medieval \u2013 Modern times), so does history allowing you to acquire several types of more and more powerful cards: Buildings to bring you more resources and some occasional special abilities, Knowledges that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them, Wonders which are very expensive but very powerful (and very rewarding as victory points) and, to finish with, Cultural Policies cards which can be activated thanks to culture points given by other type of cards and which will give you powerful passive permanent advantages.\nCITY AND CROSS-TAPING\nBefore the first turn, you randomly draw 9 cards from your deck (out of 14 at the beginning of the game) and place them on the table in a square of 3x3 cards: this is your city for the first turn. Over the course of the game, your city will evolve. You\u2019ll start with basic buildings with limited interaction, but by the end of the game, your city will be full of advanced buildings, breathtaking wonders, and top-notch Knowledge.\nHowever, even if there are 9 cards in your city, you can only activate 5 of them on each turn. This will lead to difficult choices, as all cards can be useful. Your citizens cannot work all the time though, and you need to allow them to rest.\nThis unique gaming mechanic is called CROSS-TAPPING. To activate your cards, you choose a line and a column in your city, and activate (tap) the cards from this line and column (5 cards out of 9). You can choose any line and any column; you simply cannot choose two lines or two columns.\nThis innovative mechanic introduces a whole new way of programing and using the cards of your deck turn after turn as optimization and combos are the heart of the game.\nEXPLORATION AND CONQUEST\nDeveloping your city and your empire will require you to gather resources and to conquer new territories.\nThe territories of Monumental are called Provinces. The modular game board gives the basic setup of each game. This setup will be different whether you use one of the pre-defined scenarios (made for a certain number of players) or one of the scenarios you create.\nAt the beginning of the game, the provinces are all to discover and are occupied by independent barbarian tribes or ancient Free Cities. You\u2019ll have to move your army (thanks to your military points) to conquer them. The conquest mechanism is very simple: one military point allow you to move one unit \u2013 you need to move at least the same number of military units as the defense value of the province (a number given by the terrain difficulty + the existing inhabitants resistance). Each conquered province gives you victory points at the end of the game but it also gives you more required space to build your wonders.\nThe Provinces also contains various resources depending on them. Sometimes you may recruit some workers (as a production token) and sometimes you may end up in a Maketplace (such as Babylon or Rome) where you will be able to grab new resources to bring to your city in order to enhance your future turns capacity of development. All these resources are only opened to your Explorers who moves thanks to military points too but who never take part in any battle.\nTurn after turns your realm will become bigger and bigger, your knowledge and culture stronger and your buildings and wonders more and more impressive.\nDesigned to be extremely modular, Monumental is implementing on one side the power and depth of a deckbuilding system which loads the game with hundreds of potential combos and on the other side the flexibility of a modular game board which allows the players to create an infinity of new scenarios, all of this to bring on the table a game that is super easy to learn but hard to master thanks to an important learning curve and which will grant dozens and dozens of hours of renewed playing pleasure!\nPlease note that we are currently working on the graphic layout of the rules. However, you may already access the prototype PDF file which is absolutely not what the final files layout will be ;). Please note also that, despite the fact that these rules have been thoroughly tested, they may still evolve during the campaign tweaking and fine tuning process.\nPlease click on the pic to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\n                    My name is Matthew Dunstan, and I\u2019m a research scientist and game designer based in Cambridge, UK. I started designing games about 8 years ago, when I was still living in Australia, and to date I have had 11 published designs. Monumental is my second game with Funforge following the release of Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time last year. Monumental is a fitting title for the game, considering it is the most ambitious of my designs to date!\nWhile the origin of Monumental isn\u2019t as old as the Pyramids or Stonehenge, it is still one with many twists and turns, a journey that started over 4 years ago. At the heart of Monumental is a new mechanic I call \u2018cross-tapping\u2019, where you deal cards from your deck into a 3 x 3 grid, and you choose 1 row and 1 column of cards to use on your turn. In this very simple system, you already have all the tools for some very satisfying combos, and every turn you are presented with engaging and interesting decisions.\nI was intrigued by deck-building games, which are interesting by the fact of them offering a random selection of cards from your deck each turn, and then you have to make the most of what you have been dealt. But the interest is not really in the playing of the cards \u2013 once you have a hand your choice of actions is mostly automatic. I wanted this feeling of getting a new set of opportunities each turn, but with some juicy decisions as to how to use these opportunities. What do you need to do right now, and what can wait until later? Do you pull off a small combo now, or wait and hope for something even better? Hopefully this tension and excitement permeates through Monumental from its core mechanism.\nFunforge has done an amazing job bringing my design to life, immersing you in the world of mighty armies, feats of technological advancement and towering wonders. The choices you make in Monumental will ultimately tell the tale of your civilization...what will you be remembered for?\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/monumental\nPledge levels will be available in English or French. You\u2019ll have to choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager, after the campaign completion.\nWe will also deliver Digital only versions (pdf files) in the following languages: German, Polish and Spanish. Please note that these digital files are not yet available and will be provided somewhere between the end of the KS campaign and the delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais. Vous devrez choisir la langue de votre pledge dans le Pledge Manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne.\nNous fournirons \u00e9galement des fichiers uniquement digitaux (pdf) dans les langues suivantes : Allemand, Polonais et Espagnol. Notez que ces fichiers ne sont pas encore disponibles et seront fournis entre la fin de la campagne KS et la livraison des jeux.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign completion.\nWe will collect all information through the Pledge Manager in order to dispatch your pledge to the most accurate of our international shipping hubs.\nHere are the initial estimates for the shipping costs depending on your area of living. Please, keep in mind that these costs may rise depending on the evolution of the campaign (unlocked stretch goals which will increase the weight of the parcel) and on the potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\nUSA: 12-15\u20ac to most states, 40\u20ac to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\nEUROPE: 12\u20ac to France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. 15-20\u20ac to the rest of the UE countries. 20-25\u20ac to the non UE-countries.\nCANADA: 20\u20ac to most cities\nLATIN AMERICA: 45-80\u20ac to most countries.\nASIA: 15\u20ac to China and Hong Kong. 20-30\u20ac to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: 20-30\u20ac to Australia. 35\u20ac to New Zealand.\nFRENCH TERRITORIES: 40\u20ac to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nREST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): 80-100\u20ac to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or custom fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you). As a reminder, if your country is listed into the Friendly shipping badges, you would have no import fees to pay.\nThe decision of making this project a Kickstarter exclusive is the result of a long and precise thinking.\nIn short, we had the choice of offering a \u00ab regular \u00bb game at a \u00ab regular \u00bb price or a fantastic game at a fair price.\nWe decided to go for the second option as we believe that this game deserves the best from our publishing efforts. Notably we have put a lot of hard work for months into the testing process but most and foremost into the production works, hiring dozens of stellar artists to turn each of the card artwork into a masterpiece. This is also true regarding the mini pre-production process for which we aimed to fantastic sculptures and unique (and expensive) design choices. These are just some examples of our commitment into making MONUMENTAL a unique experience for you.\nWe are used to publish games for ten years now and we know fairly well the distribution network and how it works. Should we choose to let this game go to the regular network, it would have been financially unsustainable for us because of the cascading margins of the classic distribution scheme.\nGame Designer: Matthew Dunstan\nPublisher: Funforge\nArt Direction: Philippe Nouhra\nArtworks: Paul Mafayon, Georges \"Gorg\" Bouchelaghem, Fajareka Setiawan, Agri Karuniawan, Asep Ariyanto, Maerel Hibadita, Tey Bartolome, Justine Cruz, Wyn Lacabra, Raph Lomotan, Brian Valeza, Chang-Wei Chen, Andreas Rocha, Marco Gorlei, Hendry Iwanaga, Philippe Nouhra, Charles-Victorien Kaing, Grafit Studio, Ivan Sevic, Roman Tishenin, Piotr Dura, Eugenia Firs, Jordan Albro, Orion Vang, Esmail Zalat, Uros Sljivic, Heng Tang, Tomislav Jagnjic, Alisher Mirzoev, Tuan Nguyen, Alexandre Mokhov, Martin Mottet\nLead sculptor: Charles-Victorien Kaing\nAdditional sculptors: Alfonso Gonso, Nicolas Pessina, Gregory Krasnoperov, Raul Garcia Latorre\nTranslator & rules editing: Antoine Prono, Gersende Cheylan, Claude Amardeil\nPublisher Testing: Philippe Nouhra, Antoine Prono, Claude Amardeil, Thomas Baggi-Sani, Charlotte Noailles, Gersende Cheylan\nLead Community Manager: Charlotte Noailles\nAdditional Community Managers: Claude, Brett, Valentin\nTabletopia integration: Thomas Baggi-Sani\nFunforge would like to express special thanks to David Preti and R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e, you guys are the best! ;)\nFunforge social networks\nOfficial FB page: @MONUMENTALboardgame\nFunforge FB page: @Funforge\nTwitter: @funforge\nInstagram: @funforge\nTo spread the word!

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\n\nUse this link to access the Pledge Manager for Backer Rewards and Late Pledges! \nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. This Kickstarter features Barricades Mode designed by Bryan Reese - rules and components for Solo & CoOp play, plus Quest 6: What Lies Beneath. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter (but no new content), To The Barricades! which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion + Barricades! which combines both into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes the Champion Reward, To the Barricades, 6 packs of Premium Sleeves, the Epic Thunderstone Add-on for Champion, and the Neoprene Mat.\nNote for Expedited Backers: You can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Champion Expedited. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. We will ensure that every Expedited Backer who wants this Add-on will be able to get it regardless of the quantity ordered by other backers.\n\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your Champion Expedited.\n\nNote for All other Backers (including $1 Backers): You will be able to upgrade your Reward in the Pledge Manager to Your Inventory Is Full! at the same price listed in this Kickstarter. QUANTITIES MAY BE LIMITED, so to guarantee that you get this Reward, select it now!\nAll Quests, including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath, and the Stretch Goals from this campaign, can be played in either Barricades Mode or normal Competitive Mode.\nFollow the story of our Stretch Goals through Kickstarter Updates!\nThe Backers of this campaign successfully unlocked all the contents of Quest 7: Frostbite(*)! Quest 7 will join Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in the To The Barricades! portion of the Rewards for this Kickstarter.\nThe Premium To the Barricades Box!\n(This packaging is for illustration purposes only. Actual box will differ in graphics and dimensions.)\nWith the completion of this Kickstarter the Thunderstone Quest product line will be quite large. 7 Quests, support for 6 players, and all the components of Barricades Mode, 8 plastic figures, plus Epic Thunderstone support and the Neoprene Mat.\nPlayers who sleeve their cards will have filled the original Champions box. Therefore the To the Barricades box is being engineered to complement the Champion box.\nIn addition, we\u2019re designing a plastic vac-formed tray that you can use to organize the various tokens and chits as you play. You can store those things in the tray in the box, and when it\u2019s time to play you can remove the tray and put it on the table! The tray will be designed to accommodate all the various tokens & chits included in Champion + Barricades and a little bit of future proofing as well!\nCurrently we envision a box with the same dimensions as the Champion box. The two boxes will be graphically designed to compliment each other on your shelf.\nWe believe that when you sleeve all cards including Epic the two boxes together will have room for one or two additional Quests beyond Quest 7, although the storage of the Neoprene Playmat Add-on will affect how many cards can be stored in the boxes.\nWe expect to provide a suggested setup for managing all the cards and components across the two boxes when To the Barricades is delivered. Some people will prefer to organize their cards alphabetically by type. Others will organize them by Quest. We will have suggested setups for both.\nThe To the Barricades! Box will be Kickstarter Exclusive!\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals are included in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory Is Full!, but are not included in the Champion reward.\nThe Champion, Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory is Full! rewards will include all the Kickstarter Exclusive Content from the 1st Kickstarter.\nKickstarter Exclusive content (\"KSE\") are game components and accessories that are available only to backers of AEG Kickstarters. Kickstarter Exclusive Content may be released in an alternate form more widely in the future (different art, different card titles, etc.).\nThunderstone is one of the most successful games AEG has ever published. The Kickstarter for Thunderstone Quest and delivery of those rewards to our backers has enabled us to continue to develop the game and expand its scope. \nThe major innovation for Thunderstone Quest is ... Quests! Each Quest consists of a selection of dungeon tiles and monster cards that create an engaging storyline. Each Quest includes rules for selecting Village and Dungeon cards to create a variety of Adventures. After you've mastered each Quest you use random setups of Quest cards to create new Dungeons and Villages - build your own Quests and Adventures!\nThe Champion Reward\nIncludes:\nReally Big Box that holds all Champion content (even sleeved!)\n5 Quests (each Quest includes approximately 245 cards and 6 Dungeon Tiles [except Ripples in Time which includes 4])\nOver 130 base game cards (starting cards, quest cards, treasure cards, wound cards, key cards, randomizers & dividers)\nWilderness tile\nVillage game board\n6 plastic Champion figures\n140 wood tokens\n5 six-sided dice\nRule book\nQuest book\nKickstarter exclusives & extras including The Yellow Knight card & meeple (googly eyes not included)\nBarricades Mode\nOne of the most requested features from the community was the ability to play the game solo or in a co-operative game. Our team has developed an extension to Thunderstone Quest called Barricades Mode to make that possible.\nIncludes:\n6 Guardian Boards\n[ In ongoing playtesting, Guardian Key cards were removed ]\n20 damage chits\n1 Damage chit bag\n2 Marketplace overlay boards\n8 Prestige Class boards\n30 Prestige tokens\n20 Guardian Dice (D12)\n1 Threat Level wooden token\n5 Barricade tokens\n2 Additional Player Packs (all components required for adding a 5th and 6th player to both Competitive Mode and Barricades Mode)\nQuest 6: What Lies Beneath\nWe area also presenting Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in this campaign. What Lies Beneath is designed to work with Barricades Mode to create a seamless storytelling experience. What Lies Beneath can be played in normal competitive mode too. All of the other Quests will be compatible with Barricades Mode.\nIncludes:\nApproximately 245 cards\n6 Dungeon tiles\nRulebook\nEpic Thunderstone support cards\nFull color storage box (will also hold components from Barricades Mode)\nThunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon is on Kickstarter so that we can bring all our current backers the content they've asked for quickly, and to create an opportunity for new backers to join the adventure and get access to all the Kickstarter Exclusive content from the first campaign.\nThe Stretch Goals in this campaign will be included in the To The Barricades! reward, and the Champion + Barricades!, and the Your Inventory Is Full! reward, but not the Champion reward.\n\n(*) Quest 7: Frostbite is a working title and is subject to change.\nThe rules for Thunderstone Quest are available for download on the Thunderstone page at alderac.com. \nUpdate 15AUG:  We have produced a special Print & Play package for Barricades Mode that you can download and assemble at home. This is version 2.2 of the Barricades Mode system! If you own Thunderstone Quest, you'll be able to play Barricades Mode with this Print & Play!\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nThis new version of Thunderstone enhances the Dungeon mechanic introduced in classic Thunderstone. In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an Adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.\nThunderstone Quest uses a lot of the rules from previous versions of Thunderstone but the cards from previous versions are not compatible.\nThe heroes must travel through time and into the arctic waste in search of a legendary artifact of great power. Follow along as their story unfolds with each new Stretch Goal!\nEpic Thunderstone: \nOur 1st Add-On is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion and Champion + Barricades! Reward. If you backed the first Kickstarter and are backing this Kickstarter at the To the Barricades! level you can also order this Add-on.\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll new content (including Stretch Goals) in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play created by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook.\nThis Add-On is a pre-built Epic Thunderstone deck ready for play. You won't have to subtract cards from your main play set to play Epic Thunderstone.\nYou'll need a full copy of Thunderstone Quest to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the main game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern.\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within the To the Barricades box for this Kickstarter, rolled up. The length will be between 295 and 300 mm. The width is still undetermined; the graphics team will be redesigning the Village layout to accommodate the new size after the Kickstarter but the total will be smaller than the current Village board.\nPremium Sleeves\nOur 2nd Add-On are packs of Premium Sleeves. These Sleeves use the same plastic we used in the Mystic Vale sleeves.\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 1 more pack to sleeve the new content in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades!.\nThe Champion box holds all the Champion content, plus the Epic Add-on cards sleeved. You will need to store future Quests (including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath and the stretch goals from this campaign) in their own boxes if you wish to sleeve them.\nAdventurer Catch-Up Kit\nOur third Add-on is a way for people who purchased the Adventurer Reward in the first Kickstarter to get the Quests that they did not purchase in the first campaign. It consists of Quest 3: Risen from the Mire, and Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World. The Quests will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the To The Barricades! pledge level to order this Add-on (all this content is included in the Champion and Champion + Barricades! rewards.)\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected the Champion+Barricades (Expedited US Only) reward you will receive your Champion box in an expedited early shipment soon after the campaign ends. We have 1,000 units of Champion in our warehouse in the US so we will be able to send the Champion part of your Reward on an expedited timeline. We believe we can have them delivered 6 to 8 weeks after the close of the campaign. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nBecause this inventory is already in the United States the cost, customs issues, and complexity of shipping to non-US addresses prohibit us from delivering the expedited portion of the Reward outside the United States.\nThe cost to ship the Champion Reward for expedited delivery will be borne by AEG. Backers at this level will pay for shipping & handling for the rest of the Reward normally based on weight, and the rest of the Reward will ship at the same time as fulfillment of all other Reward content for this Kickstarter in 2019.\n\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! (including Stretch Goals) without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. \nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! at 23lbs/12kg.\nUSA:$23 \nCANADA: $40 \nEUROPE: $27 to Germany. $39 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nLATIN AMERICA: $80 to most countries. \nASIA: $33 to China and Hong Kong. $62 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $45 to Australia. $75 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $80\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping To The Barricades!

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores.

Each turn provides players a wide array of options and tools to pull ahead. You can focus on improving the lands of your kingdom, upgrading from simple meadows to a thriving economic engine. Or perhaps you'd rather battle your way to victory, plundering the other kingdoms' riches. With limited space to build and only three positions for key advisers, strategic decisions must be made to guarantee victory.\n Now unlocked, the Trade Route. \nA free mini-expansion for backers of any physical copy pledge. The Trade Route includes supplemental rules featuring a card drafting mechanic, new interaction using the Riches cards, and a new beautifully illustrated center game board -- now unlocked!\nNew Trade Route cards have been unlocked!\nRuler Traits have been unlocked for backers!\nAn optional mini-expansion that adds more depth, asymmetry, and replay value. Wall your kingdom off, by taking the Isolationist Trait, or hoard as much gold as you can, by taking the Avaricious Trait. Bring your kingdom to new heights with the Ambitious Trait, or swindle your opponents with the Mercantile Trait.\nIn the solo mode, race against an ever-expanding rival as you try to out-build and outscore the shadow kingdom.  \nA second solo mode, Conquest of the King, has been unlocked!! \nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nGeek Spiel\nUnfiltered Gamer\nSkip to example turn here.

Each hand is like a little puzzle where I need to figure out how to get the most value from it.\" -VVildcard\nUnedited audio from a blind playtest at a convention:\n [More reviews coming soon]\nThe current rules can be found here.\nSolo mode game play video with the developer\nI missed counting 2 VP for the Shadow Kingdom, can anyone figure out how many points the Shadow Kingdom had, and if I won this game or not? The rule book might come in handy! Comment if you've figured it out.\nGame Overview from Board Game Coffee\nSet up\nThe Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced decks are placed in the middle of the table. Each player sets a Kingdom Board, 3 Riches cards, and a Center Land card in front of them\nAction Phase \nEach player gets 3 actions per turn to improve their kingdoms, progress to better decks, and gather as many victory points as possible.\nActions\n Playing a card from their hand \n Drawing or drafting a Basic card\nPlayers will play Land, Person, Event and Victory cards as they advance their kingdom.\nLand Cards - The foundation of any kingdom. With only 8 tiles available for land cards players must make their choices carefully. Resource land cards can stack and upgrade resource cards of the same type.\nPerson Cards - The life force of a kingdom. Person cards will add resource, strength and defense to your kingdom and will play a vital role in balancing war and prosperity.\nEvent Cards - Events can alter the course of medieval history, but make sure it's in your favor. A key component to player interactivity, these cards add another layer of strategy. As you progress to higher decks, the event cards become more powerful allowing for victory point swings and keeping each game close right down to the very end. \nVictory Cards - Great achievements rewarded only to those that seize the opportunity. Victory cards allows players to boost their kingdom to glory, provided they meet the demands.\nDiscard Phase\nEach player can then choose to discard any number of cards from their hand. They will redraw back to their maximum hand size during the final phase of their turn.\nDeck Check Phase \nEach player checks to see if they can upgrade their kingdom based on the level of cards they have in play. Once a player has met the requirements, they can upgrade their kingdom and Center Land. They will be able to draw according to their upgraded Kingdom Level in the next phase.\nDraw Phase\nAt the end of a player\u2019s turn, they draft or draw cards back to their maximum hand size. Each card in the draft is replaced when selected. The maximum hand size by default is 5, but it can be expanded by certain cards.\nEnd of Game \nThere is an \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d card within the Advanced deck. When this card is drawn, each player will play one final turn. After all turns are played, each player will count their current Victory Points (VP). The player with the most VPs wins!\nSolo Mode\nRace Against the Shadow Kingdom\nIn the Solo mode, the game's setup, player turn actions, and player scoring are identical to the normal rules. After each turn the player takes, cards are drawn and placed face up for the Shadow Kingdom. The amount and type of cards drawn for the Shadow Kingdom depends on the player's current kingdom progression. The player can use Event cards against the Shadow Kingdom but be warned, if Event cards are drawn by the Shadow Kingdom there are unique effects that may occur.\nAfter the player draws the Age of Enlightenment card, the player's Victory Points are compared against the Shadow Kingdoms, the latter using a special scoring method.\nConquest of the King\nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nNaming Rules  \nKeeping the medieval theme is very important to us. We want backers to be able to include their own personal touch to our game but it must fit the following rules. \nFor the Person Cards, this can be any variant of First Name, Last Name and a Title within 35 characters. Land card names can be more flexible but all must stay within the theme.\nWe will work with you to agree upon a name but we reserve the right to decline any name that we feel would be detrimental to the game\nThere will be a deadline for sending your name requests to us. If you do not meet this deadline, we won't be able to use your chosen name. You will still be printed as a SIlver or Gold supporter in the rule book.\nThere will be a deadline for sending in a photo for your portrait to be added in to the game. Our talented illustrator, Jeff, may have some preferences in lighting or pose, so sending a couple reference images will help.\nThe Portrait tier will have our Illustrator, Jeff Porter, paint you into the game.

Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself.\nTang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.\nTang Garden is played in a variable number of turns. In each of these turns, the player will be allowed to pick only one action between expanding the garden and decorating the garden: Both actions balance each other, putting the player in the position of making simple and profound choices simultaneously.\nBringing Tang Garden to reality will only be possible with your support. \nMake the game better for everyone. Stretch goals will enhance the final quality and content of the game, the more we fund, the more we can upgrade. We will also offer a serie of Kickstarter Exclusive Stretch Goals.\nThe Deluxe edition contains a Limited Edition numbered Expansion. It won't be possible to get it in distribution. \nGet more value of what you pledge and a competitive discounted and tracked shipping rate.\nWe have planned the size and weight of the game after the Stretch Goals are unlocked and the shipping box will weight around 4 to 5 Kg. We are partnering up with our loyal fulfillment centers: QuarterMaster Logistics for USA, VFI for Asia, Snakes & Lattes for Canada and DHL + GLS tracked and reliable shipping couriers for Europe.\nAfter the campaign ends you will be able to choose your Base Game language from: English, French, German and Spanish.\nThe Deluxe Exclusive expansion: Ghost Stories, will include a multi language rulebook.\nFor the Italian version of the game, please pledge towards our partner, GateOnGames!

It is a challenge to create a game, manufacture it and then ship to the warehouse, but the most important of all, fulfill our backers. After what we learnt from our first three projects, specially Tao Long, we feel confident and prepared to manage this project in the best way possible.\n\nWe have delivered three games and Spirits of the Forest is going into assembling the shipped by sea very soon.\n\nTo avoid any delays, we decided to prepare the game assets for Tang Garden before the campaign. All the files but the rulebook are already in hands of our manufacturer and we should receive a final pre-production copy a couple weeks after the end of the campaign. \n\nLogistics is the most difficult part or running a campaign. From the lessons learned we are combining every time inside boxes as we did for Spirits of the Forest.\n\n- Base Game backers will receive two boxes (Base Game + Stretch Goals)\n- Deluxe backers will receive three boxes (Base Game + Stretch Goals, Tang Garden: Ghost Stories)\n\nThis time around we are also making sure all the add-ons have their own packing. For the decorations we are using booster packs, for the single characters as the Wayfarer tuck boxes and all the expansions and metal coin inside 2-pcs setup boxes.\n\nThese are our fulfillment partners for this campaign: \n- VFI will deliver the games to most of our Asian backers while the rest will be sent by DHL from Europe.\n- VR Distribution will deliver the games in Australia and New Zealand. \n- Quarter Master Logistics will deliver the games to our backers in the US. \n- ThunderGryph together with TCG & Happyshops will deliver the games to all our European Backers by using tracked DHL. \n- Snakes & Lattes will deliver the games to our Canadian Backers. \n- Any \"rest of the world\" backers will be fulfilled by ThunderGryph Games and HappyShops using DHL.\n\nWe are consistently monitoring the project and working hard to remove as much risk as we can from you and bear with it ourselves, If you have any questions about the project development please don't hesitate to ask.

The spies are able to move the monkey, and will also count towards the number of worker lice on that monkey (beware of that nitpicking!). This adds a whole new dimension to the game, making you rethink your old strategies. Also, we'll add a completely new game mode in which you're playing as a species of monkeys, trying to get rid of the lice!\nWith it's extensive development and play-testing, high quality components, and beautiful artwork, we believe there's little to improve on Itchy Monkey with (numerous) stretch goals.

We'll provide you with all the necessary information.\nTo make sure Itchy Monkey arrives at your doorstep safely, we will use a great fulfillment partner. All shipping fees are standard, and based on the actual fee we will need to pay our fulfillment partner. This also means we can ship EU and US-friendly to our backers.\nThe shipping fees will be charged after the campaign through our pledge manager Backerkit, another renowned company.\nTo reduce shipping costs for backers in Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, we will take care of the logistics in these countries ourselves. For an overview of the prices see below.\nGroup pledge\nYou can reduce shipping costs by making a group pledge!\nHere's an overview of a few examples for sending 5 games. For an accurate price for your country or more information, please send us a message or email us at kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com.\nJust like with our previous Kickstarter it is possible to pick up your game at one of the many conventions we're attending, including Essen SPIEL 2018.\nDanish backers\nIt's now possible to ship to Denmark via a group pledge. The designer (Allan, see below) will facilitate this himself, with the help of a boardgame cafe in the area of \u00c5rhus. Backers will be able to pick up the games on specific dates and will share the shipping costs. This option will be available through the pledge manager after the campaign. The reduced shipping costs will be charged at that time as well.\nBlack Box Adventures is an indie tabletop games developer and publisher from the Netherlands. We strive to bring you games with our three core values in mind:\nQUALITY: what you get is a high quality product worth your time, as we want to bring you more than some cards and dice in a box. Yes, we are a business, and our business is to make you happy.\nORIGINALITY: Zombies vs Cthulhu? Booooring!! We strive to think outside of the box and make tabletop games with unique twists and themes. Lice colonising monkeys... now we're talking.\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE: we only publish games that have our full support, but we\u2019re all just ordinary people. We like to work with our community so please let us know what you think!\nItchy Monkey: a Battle of Lice is the brainchild of Allan Kirkeby. For the art we partnered up with Maarten de Schrijver, the designer and illustrator of \"Frutti di Mare: Veni, Vidi, Antipasti!\". Maarten is a 2D and 3D designer, which you'll quickly recognize from the beautifully designed artwork and animation. When Allan presented his game to us the original game mechanics and theme struck us immediately. After more play testing and some adjustments Itchy Monkey was ready to be launched on Kickstarter.\nDoing some field research...\nMeet the game designer: Allan Kirkeby\nI\u2019ve always loved playing and making games. I made my first board game as a kid. In my teens I played tabletop miniature games, and designed campaign-worlds as a D&D game master. I got my first computer and started playing games, but quickly realized that making games with a computer was even more fun. Since then I\u2019ve designed and lead the development of a lot of computer games. Today I spend my daytime as an advisor and teacher for start-up computer game companies, and my evenings and weekends designing, building and playing board games.\nListen to a podcast featuring Allan Kirkeby!\nAllan Kirkeby\nClick this badge to get us to the top of the Kicktraq Hot List!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith two successfully funded and fulfilled projects, Black Box Adventures is ready for more. Although every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project, we've got a great track record to give our backers confidence.\n\nThe game, artwork and design are ready to be printed. We received quotes from multiple manufacturers, both domestic as well as foreign. To get the high quality we want, we've chosen one of the best production facilities available. The manufacturer will print and assemble the games. None of the components need to come from China, so there won't be any possible delays/problems that are associated with overseas freight shipping.\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. Because the game is produced in the EU, EU-backers won't need to worry about extra customs charges. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfilment process.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer the game will be ready before Essen SPIEL 2018, however some events may be out of our or their reach. If for some unforeseen circumstances we won't be able to deliver the product at Essen SPIEL 2018, we will have to arrange a pickup at another convention or charge shipping costs.\n\nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece drooling in flavor on its own. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers.

With a mix of worker placement (using cultists to perform tasks), deck building (collecting monster cards, spell cards and constellation cards to add more effects to the action cards) and programming (each round, players will need to build their own action deck) players will try to start the most powerful cult and complete rituals.\nThese are the prototype Power Dice - the final dice will have more color. \nReview by Bastiaan Nox (Dutch)\nVariable Player Powers: Each Old One has its own unique ability in the game. They all play a bit differently.\nMix of Mechanics: As said, players will use worker placement, deck building and programming to build their cult.\nLuck of the Draw & Strategy: Drawing cards to enhance your deck will mostly be a thing of luck...but the truly powerful Old Ones know how to plan their cards to make the best possible combinations.\nChoose your play style: The game will come with both a Power Die and Power Cards. If you like some randomness, play with the unique 8-sided Power Die. If you like strategy and planning, play with the Power Cards.\nReplayability: The numerous cards and possible combinations, paired with 16 different rituals, 3 different upgrade paths and 20+ unique buildings will give a different game every time.\n*Only real names are accepted. We don't want any profanity.\nAt the end of the campaign, I will contact all the backers who backed with a reward to name a game element (except the Supportive Cultist backers, as all cultists are the same). Starting with the first backer on that list, each backer has a chance to choose which game element (Old One, Artifact card, Cult Leader) they want to attach their name to.\nFirst of all, I want to thank YOU! Yes, you. You took the time to view this page, read about Castle Madness and perhaps you even backed this game. Without you, this project would not even exist.\nFurthermore, I'd like to thank all the people close to me. My friends, because they were the first to endure the many, many (many) playtest sessions of Castle Madness. They provided me with the first feedback and basically made this game into what it is now. My mum, who had to proofread the many, many (many) draft rules I showed her. My girlfriend, who had to put up with me for many (you get the idea) hours while I was in the same room with her, but at the same time, far away in Naallemrak.\nAlso, thank you to the people I got to know along the way. Arne De Cnodder and Gert Breugelmans, who became a valuable playtesters. All the visitors from Spiel '17 who took the time to stop at my booth and play a demo game. Seb Van Deun & Rudy Seuntjens from the Game Brewer and the games store De Kolonisten here in Turnhout, who gave me advice and let me use the store to host some demo games. Daniel Zayas and Tony Shen from LongPack Games for being patient with all my questions. SharkeeGames who helped me with finding shipping solutions. And Justin from OTX and Seth & Chris from QuarterMaster for providing me with those shipping solutions. FatherGeek who wrote a review for the first campaign and gave me some good insights. Bastiaan Nox and Undead Viking for their amazing review videos.\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some at this moment, but that doesn't make your contribution any less valuable. Thanks you.\nAs soon as LongPack Games is done with the production of Castle Madness, OTX will freight the games to QuarterMaster who will use their close contacts with other fulfillment centers (like Aetherworks and GamesQuest) to ship all the games to their rightful owners - you!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign via the pledge manager, to guarantee an honest and accurate shipping cost.\nThe prices below are estimates based on 2018 quotes and a weight of 2,5 kg, and can differ from the final prices.\nUS: \u20ac8,5\nEurope: \u20ac13,5\nNorway: \u20ac23\nCanada: \u20ac14,5\nAustralia: \u20ac16\nNew Zealand: \u20ac21\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: \u20ac8,5\nRest of Asia: \u20ac18,5\nAll other countries: \u20ac55", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I'm new to creating on Kickstarter, the entire campaign will be a challenge for me, I\u2019ll be honest. But I\u2019m backed by tested professionals who know their way around in this world.\n\nSome of you might notice that this is the second try on Kickstarter for Castle Madness. I believe I made some mistakes last time which made the funding goal too high. For example, I went to a publisher instead of a manufacturer to get the game made. This time however, I've cut out the middle man and went straight to a manufacturer.\n\nNow, with a realistic funding goal and realistic pledge level values, I believe Castle Madness is truly ready to be released into the world.\n\nLongPack Games will manufacture the game if the campaign is a success. I've met them at Spiel '17 when I was there promoting Castle Madness' first try on Kickstarter. They truly were a big help and I've contacted them after the first campaign failed to get this project on track again.\n\nFor the moment, this game will be a totally Kickstarter and event exclusive. As of yet, I have no publisher to bring this game to the retailers. The goal of this campaign is to get this game onto other players' tables and if a publisher discovers it along the way, so much the better!\n\nI really believe in this game and I think it is worth publishing.

You can download them right now from here:\nExploriana - Reglas\nWe hope to have more translations soon! If you would like to get involved and translate the rules we are currently looking for German and French translations! \nEXPLORIANA is a competitive push your luck game of exploration and discovery designed by Miles Ratcliffe  with stunningly gorgeous artwork by Richard Dearing. The players control the fates of intrepid explorers travelling to the far off regions of the globe in search of unknown species of plants, fantastic animals, glittering treasures and incredible lost cities that have never been seen before!\nLate in the 19th century vast continents open up to exploration and a wave of interest grips scientists and explorers across the globe. Fantastic animals, strange and beautiful plants, fantastic treasures and ancient sites of lost civilisations all await discovery. Expeditions to far-off regions are always filled with peril, but the challenge is hard to resist. Brave adventurers in search of riches, scientists with a hankering for knowledge and recognition, and intrepid explorers with a burning desire to map the globe: all set out for these wondrous lands with hopes of gaining a place in the history books.\nBelow is a brief overview of Exploriana. To get a full understanding of the game we have several ways in which you can get more information!\nWant to try Exploriana? You can try our Print & Play versions or head over to Tabletopia for a virtual experience!\n                 Thanks to Tabletopia you can try Exploriana now with your friends\nPlay NOW on Tabletopia!\n   In Exploriana you decide the fate of brave explorers as they set out to far flung corners of the globe and trek deep into dangerous, uncharted wilds. Exploriana incorporates several game mechanics:\nresource management (money is the major resource in the game)\nvariable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\npush your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards discovering treasure & avoiding dangers)\nan auction every round (winning auctions gains special item cards)\nset collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards will deliver more points)\nworker placement (placing your explorers is a crucial decision)\n Exploriana is played over a number of rounds split into four phases \nIncome & Auction phases\nEach turn the players collect some extra funding during the income phase, then they bid against each other in the quick fire auction phase to attempt to acquire some choice items from the items deck. Some items assist the players on their perilous expeditions and some help the players grab bonus victory points.\nSend Explorers phase\nNow it's time to send your explorers off on their voyages of discovery in the 'send explorers' phase. There are three regions to explore in Exploriana, South America, Africa and the Far East, all uncharted, filled with wonder and teeming with danger and the players must decide which of the regions they will brave. \nDiscovery phase\nThe discovery phase uses three very different region decks. Each deck is packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries but each also has an increasing amount of peril, from South America, to Africa through to the most dangerous region, The Far East. \nThe discovery phase uses an exciting push your luck mechanic to represent the expeditions heading further and further into the wilds. The players reveal cards until they either decide to stop and make some discoveries or to push on, reveal too many hazards they will get hopelessly lost instead.\nAs a player reveals discoveries, one card at a time, there is a chance that the card may have an associated hazard. Before revealing the next discovery the player may first hire a local guide, to cancel one revealed hazard, or use items that can help the expedition avoid disaster. However, if a player reveals any three hazards of the same type or all three different hazards, then the expedition is lost and makes no new discoveries.\nThere are three different types of hazards represented in Exploriana, the dangerous uncharted terrain the explorers must trek through, ferocious creatures that could attack the expedition at any time and simply losing ones way, forcing the party to backtrack and waste valuable time and resources.\nThe number of discoveries that an expedition can make while exploring is dependant on the types of discoveries revealed and how far the expedition manages to push into the wilds. A player can reveal up to five discovery cards for each of their expeditions and may choose to discover all of the revealed animals or any one of the others or they may even be able to rescue a lost explorer. If they were brave or lucky enough to have revealed all five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra selection. \nVictory \nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points. There are various ways to get victory points in Exploriana and bonus victory points are also awarded at the end of the game.\nThe discoveries the players make can give them renown, wealth and victory points, some even give the player more than one type. Renown determines the turn order and awards some bonus victory points. Any money the players have accumulated during the game converts into bonus victory points. Some of the items may give a player bonus victory points, some enhance victory points awarded by discoveries and some are worth money. Finally, lost explorers that your expeditions have rescued can increase your wealth and also add a variable number of bonus victory points.\nThe various mechanics and hard decisions the players are forced to make at every turn ensure multiple paths to victory, making Exploriana exciting and really enjoyable. A game you will want to play again and again!\nInterested in a run through of the game?

Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date. \n\nThe game is complete and we have already self funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well known and well established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery to the fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product. \n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Team Glory\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExploriana has been developed and produced by a collaboration of three separate games companies, Chaos Publishing Ltd, Triple Ace Games Ltd...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Show your support for Exploriana with a token pledge and join us on our Kickstarter expedition.\nBy making a small pledge you can follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style boardgame of 60 to 120 minutes for 2 to 4 players.\nGraphic design and primary illustrations by Alayna Lemmer-Danner.\nPlayers are the heads of powerful guilds in the city of Aegis. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the Aegis in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.\nThe Guilds exert their control in the city by sending Agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of Aegis. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to Aegis' infrastructure.\nTo win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the city such as defending it from external and internal threats.\nHere are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:\n1. Card Crafting: \nSimilar to the original Card Crafting System game Mystic Vale all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on 1/3rd of the slip and are transparent on the other 2/3rds. During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). Each card represents either an important citizen or a patrician of the city which may or may not bare allegiance to a guild. Each advancement in the game is linked to an important location in the city and represents an individual with sway or power over that location. By crafting cards players are giving their citizens and patricians connections to the key power brokers of the city, and thereby the influence needed to benefit from the military, economic and political institutions of the city. Power in Aegis is all about being well connected.\nUnlike Mystic Vale the cards are double-sided. The back side of each citizen and patrician is its evil counterpart from the Blight: either a Dark Agent or an Archfiend. Each time you sleeve a new connection onto one of you citizens or patricians you also are adding a new threat to the back-side of the card, giving the Dark Agent or Archfiend a new minion or evil spirit to command in its sinister plot against the city.\n2. Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: \nRather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different citizens and patricians in that deck. You may benefit from the connections of other players' guild members, but the favor comes with a price; one coin paid to that player for each connection of theirs you want to use. During the game you can claim the allegiance of more citizens and patricians in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal on it, meaning you now control a larger portion on the main deck.\n3. Card-driven worker placement: \nWhile your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. You don't pay a cost to sleeve an Advancement or use its ability: instead many require the use of Agents. For example, many effects require dispatching or recovering Agents to or from different city Locations. This represents the key connection of that Location granting, jobs, positions or access to your guild members. Many Locations have abilities that are powered-up or can be triggered once you have enough Agents there. Since you have a limited number of Agents to use, you will constantly have to choose which useful thing to forgo in order to do another.\n4. Threat Tower: There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and who the Blight will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Tower, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes accumulate on a card, that blight attacks Aegis, and player with the most of their color cubes is responsible for defending the city. Fail in your responsibility and your guild loses reputation, succeed and you guild gains reputation.\n5. Modular set up: \nEach game you use 10 Locations. The Agent Reward has 12, the Guildmaster Reward begins with 21 and more planned as Stretch Goals. The rules will have various recommended sets of Location to use, with each set offering multiple paths to victory and a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you can peruse. The Locations set for a game can also be specifically selected by you or chosen randomly, making for even more variety. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Advancements representing the key connection at that Location. Location Boards may specify special rules for Agent placement or extend the basic rules with all new systems such as area majority, or the ability to assemble a party of heroes and hunt the Blight, or offer the possibility to actually join the \"Blood Cult\" and become evil yourself.\nThe game is designed for 2-4 players. Our first Stretch Goal unlocks solo rules. There are no co-op rules for Edge of Darkness. \nClick Here to Download the Edge of Darkness Prototype Rules\nThese rules are not final and will continue to evolve as we move closer to production of the game. Please send any questions or comments about the rules to edge@alderac.com.\nBecause of the complex nature of the components of Edge of Darkness it isn't possible to produce a print & play version of the game.\nWe've designed our logistics system to provide the lowest possible cost for the delivery of your Rewards!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address.

Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input. \n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once. \n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

By order of the bishop, you have been commissioned to restore a large fresco painting on the cathedral's ceiling. But not surprisingly, you are not the only master commissioned for the project.\nThis is an engaging game for families and gamers that has been recognized with over 15 major award nominations and wins worldwide, including a nomination for the Spiel de Jahres (German Board Game of the Year) and the winner of the Deutscher Spiel Preis.\nYou will need to carefully plan your workday: when to wake the apprentices, what stalls to visit, which paints to buy, which tiles to paint, and when it is appropriate to make a generous donation to the bishop. Buying materials costs money, so be prepared to take on additional projects to earn money to acquire the paints and materials necessary for completing your tasks; but your apprentices are not automatons, you need to keep them happy too. An evening at the theater can go a long way toward keeping your apprentices happy. By managing your decisions carefully and planning ahead, you can become one of the masters of the ages.The decisions you make in Fresco are all wonderfully woven into the theme of managing the challenging undertaking of restoring a Renaissance masterpiece!\nThis video describes Fresco Expansion 1 and the Scrolls module included in Fresco Big Box.\nBecause of safety issues, the glass nuggets of the previous print run will be substituted with cardboard tokens.\nThis video describes Fresco Expansion 2 included in Fresco Big Box.\nFor more information on the game check out the following link:\nBGG-Site for Fresco Big Box\nRules in different languages\nShogun re-implements Wallenstein with a setting in Japan during the Sengoku or \u201cWarring States\u201d Period (1467 - 1603). Shogun is Queen Games' highest rated game on BGG (number 126). In Shogun, each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his empire and secure points. Castles, temples and theaters replace the infrastructure of Wallenstein (as rice replaces wheat), creating a thematic experience for players who wish to move their exploits east to the Land of the Rising Sun.\n Japan during the Sengoku or \u201cWarring States\u201d Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube tower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes \u2013 SHOGUN!\nThe main goal of the game is to have as many counties under your control as possible, but that alone is not enough to win you the game. Players must develop these counties by building palaces, churches and guilds. In addition to building infrastructure, you must also feed your peasants or they will revolt. Revolting peasants can lose you armies and possibly the county. At the beginning of the game, starting locations are assigned with a drafting mechanic using country cards and cubes representing armies; this ensures a different game every time you play.\nThere are 10 actions that can be performed by a player during a game round. There are two locations involving actions. Each player has his/her own board. On this board, the player places a county card on a particular action (for example if I want to build reinforcements in Bremen, I would place my Bremen county card face down in the reinforcement action box). The order of these actions is determined by shuffling a deck of 10 cards and displaying the first 5 face up on the main game board and the last 5 face down. This order changes round to round. So while players know the last 5 actions, advance planning and maneuvering is rewarded for the players who think about what is coming.\nMoving (another one of your actions) into a country where there is another player sparks a battle. Battle can also occur when a player has moved into a Neutral County, or when a revolt occurs in one of their own counties. Battles are resolved with the dice tower. The tower is seeded at the beginning of the game with army cubes from all players and some peasants\u2019 cubes so that there can be no perfect knowledge. The attacker and defender put all their cubes from the contested area into the tower at the same time. Whoever has the most cubes that fall out of the tower and into the tray is the winner of the battle. Cubes from other players not involved in the battle that fall into the tray are not counted. However, any peasants\u2019 cubes in the tray side with the defender. In addition to invading and controlling counties, taxing counties for gold, acquiring grain to feed your peasant population, enlisting reinforcements and building infrastructure (whew!), there are event cards and bonus tiles that add additional twists to this exciting and deep game of military conquest!\nFor more information on Shogun and the Big Box check out the following links:\nBGG-Site for Big Box\nBGG-Site for Shogun Basic Game\nRules in different languages\nThe Expansions\nExpansion 1: Tenno's Court\nThe Shoguns are still fighting over the distribution of the empire\u2019s provinces while peasant revolts and famines do not encourage ruling the country. But none other than the disempowered Tenno might tip the scales for some of the sovereigns: Ensuring the favor of the Tenno by using your diplomatic skills will help you win precious gifts and highly rated privileges. But be careful: If you vie too much for the Tenno\u2019s favor you might easily loose control of your armies \u2026  \nPlayer's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; The other way for players to acquire courtiers, is by converting armies to courtiers during the game. Whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available.\nExpansion 2: Samurai\nSamurai which can be used with \"Emperor's Court\" or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as receiving gold or placing armies in the dice tower tray for future conflicts) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter (turns represent seasons) ends.\nExpansion 3: Military Leaders\nEvery player is given one military leader figure to place on one of his controlled counties. While performing actions in this county he gets extra benefits, such as costs of buildings are reduced by 1 or he earns one extra grain. At the end of a players turn he then moves the leader to an adjacent county under his control, leaving a marker at the old location. If a player can not place the leader adjacent to his county, he has to move it to any of his controlled counties not leaving a marker behind. The more markers you have on the board at the end of the game the more points will be awarded!\nExpansion 4: Chambers\nMany offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. For each region there are several positions to be filled by the players. At the beginning of each round 6 chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau. These 6 positions are available to be filled in each region by the players. Whoever has the most counties under his control in that region will fill the position and exchange the camber marker on the tableau with one of his own player markers. At the end of the game, players are awarded extra points for majorities in horizontal and vertical lines on the chamber tableau.\nProduction and Delivery  \nThe Production of Shogun and Fresco Big Box is planned for August 2018. Once produced, we plan to ship the pledges out to the backers as soon as possible.

This campaign contains the first three titles in the series.\nEvery single game is modular. They can be played stand alone, in series (adding end game scores), or integrated with 1 or more other TOKYO titles for an expanded new experience!\nTOKYO JIDOHANBAIKI is a game about Japanese vending machines and drinks! Utilizing exquisite, tactile components, this title includes over 20 unique 5-15 minute games from various guest designers across the globe. With a huge range of game types and flavors (deduction, dexterity, economic, etc), this game is perfect for any setting or player count!\nTOKYO METRO is a heavy economic simulation of the metro system in Tokyo, using a unique action placement cycling system, stock investments, speculation, loans, bicycles, grid movement, train riding, and more! Playing 1-4 players and taking 120 minutes on average, TOKYO METRO will fill the hearts of train enthusiasts and \u30b5\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 alike! \nTOKYO JUTAKU is a larger version of the previously sold out game Jutaku, where 1-8 players will take on the role of Japanese architects designing small, abstract home models on strangely shaped plots of land. With 69 unique wooden pieces and a range of building conditions from easy to very difficult, this real time dexterity game is very exciting for a large group, but can also be played as a solitary meditation experience.\nStretch goals have been planned for and costed from the outset, ensuring that their addition will not incur delivery delays or compromises in the quality of the final product elsewhere. All of the TOKYO SERIES games come fully upgraded with SPOT UV, thick chip board, linen cards, real wooden pieces, resin and ABS miniatures, and more to follow!\nAlso available as an add on is a beautiful fully metal currency that can be used with all of the TOKYO SERIES games! Only one print run of this currency design will be created.\nCheckout a basic overview video for how to play each of the games below, or even better read each rulebook after the video! For TOKYO JIDOHANBAIKI, only a few of the 20+ included games are shown, but many more will be added throughout the campaign as the rules are submitted.\nIf a game has the (\u00a5) character inside of a circle next to its title in the rulebooks, that game is eligible to be played in series by keeping a total end game cumulative yen score. (click the rulebooks to view them).\nI've had the privilege of demoing all 3 titles at Essen Spiel 2017, and at the Kickstarter booth at PAX Unplugged 2017 with great reception! Here are some shots from those events, plus some reactions from the players:\nHere are some really cool people I met, betting on which miniature drinks they think will come out of the vending machine tower.

This game of historical set collection will see players taking on the mantle of Curator in one of the world\u2019s great museums.\nDiscover lost civilisations from four continents and acquire relics to display in your galleries. Each object you exhibit will earn you points! Additionally, at the end of the game, you\u2019ll score more based on the size of your different Collections, which can be based on Civilisations or Domains. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!\nThe world will keep turning as you play however and you\u2019ll have to contend with historical events that may make the acquisition of artefacts harder, as well as facing the scrutinising gaze of public opinion.\nWill your Museum go down in the annals of history? Or will it simply be a footnote?\nMuseum is a \u00ab big box \u00bb game of set collection that allows you, as the curator, to choose the strategy that suits you best. Accomplished gamers will be able to draw out all the depth and complexity from the game\u2019s mechanics yet its simple rules can be easily adapted to suit newer and younger players.\nThe fruit of over a year\u2019s research, the 180 objects included in the game are real and each one has been lovingly redrawn by Vincent Dutrait.\n The cards are also furnished with accurate historical information, bringing each artefact to life! This continues into the rest of the game which has been designed to provide a fun and immersive experience featuring almost 300 unique illustrations!\nA challenging set collection game that can also be adapted to suit less experienced players.\nA beautiful game featuring almost 300 unique illustrations by Vincent Dutrait.\nRich historical content that will pique your curiosity!\nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 15-20min per player.\nThe Central Board represents the organised chaos that was a curator\u2019s desk during these wonderous times! On it, you\u2019ll find many of the elements required during the game.\nMost prominent are the 4 Continents and the available Objects brought back for your consideration by industrious explorers. During the game you\u2019ll be attempting to amass collections of these cards. Collections can either be based on the treasures of one Civilisation in particular, or be themed on artefact Domains, and ensure you additional points at the end of the game.\nEach card possesses a Value (used when purchasing/scoring cards), a Civilisation/colour (used when scoring collections based on civilisations) and a Domain/icon (used when scoring collections based on domains). Each of these authentic objects also has a Name, Illustration and Description. These don\u2019t have any effect on the rules but will give you a much better sense of what the game is about!\nAt the start of your turn you can choose one of the eight object cards available on the main board and take it for free. These cards will serve bothfor scoring items and as currency in the game as in Museum, objects are purchased using other objects! So, choose your card wisely\u2026do you want to exhibit a card, or do you need it to pay for something more interesting? Maybe both?\nOther players don\u2019t sit idly by during your turn either. After you\u2019ve chosen one, all the other players may also take a card. If they do though, you get Prestige Points! Prestige points represent the favours and honours your museum accumulates during the game and can be used to purchase cards!\nOnce all players have taken a card, you can move on with your action phase. Each player has a Museum Board representing the hallowed halls of their great establishment and it\u2019s in this part of the turn that you\u2019ll be filling yours with wonders from around the world.\nYou have two actions available to you:\nYou can furnish your museum (placing cards down)\nor\nPerform an Inventory (picking cards up).\nTo play a card into your museum you simply discard other cards of equal or greater value. You can also use any prestige points you collect to pay for cards too. Whenever you play objects into your museum, you score their value in points. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can purchase in one turn, as long as you can pay for them!\nDiscarded cards aren\u2019t lost however! Your Discard Pile represents your museum\u2019s storage and Objects in there can still be played exactly as if they were in your hand, with the exception of course being that you can\u2019t use them to pay for other cards.\nHowever, as you\u2019ve shown that you\u2019re not as interested in these cards, you leave them open to being taken by other parties who may have a better use for them! Effectively; cards that are in your discard pile aren\u2019t available only to you, any other player can now access them too! Any player can purchase a card from your discard pile. If they do so though, they must give you one of their Prestige points as payment!\nInstead of playing cards down you can pick them up! This action allows you to take all the cards from your discard pile and place them back in your hand. Although you won\u2019t be able to do anything else that turn, it will allow you to (maybe) get a full hand of cards back and ready to use again as well as keeping them out of the reach of your opponents!\nOnce you\u2019ve performed one of these two actions any missing objects cards on the central board are replaced and play passes to the next player!\nThis represents the basic rules and structure for each turn of the game: play will continue to pass from one player to another as each of you improves upon your collections.\nIf you think that the game is going to let you do that peacefully though, you\u2019re in for a surprise:\nHeadline cards: Historical events will unfurl as the game advances, having a direct effect on players. Headline cards can make it harder, or easier, to acquire objects as well as having other amusing or challenging effects.\nNotoriety Cards: As your Museum grows so will the different favours you can call in. Notoriety cards are powerful single-use abilities that can give you an edge during the game.\nPersonnel: A good museum needs the right people to help run it and that\u2019s where personnel cards come in. Representing experts from different fields, these individuals can help you enrich your collections and score more points at the end of the game.\nPublic Opinion: Hidden within the continent decks are Public Opinion cards. These represent the press noticing curators that have been taking lots of artefacts from certain Continents, without ever displaying them to the public! These can accumulate on different continents, leading to lost points at the end of the game if you don\u2019t manage your discard pile properly!\nPatron Cards: Rich patrons of history and art are more than willing to help you in your endeavour, all you\u2019ll have to do is meet some of their requests. You\u2019ll choose one of these cards at the start of the game and they\u2019ll ask you to assemble certain collections in order to gain more points at the end of the game.\nThe game Continues until a player reaches 50 points. This signals the end of the game as the public starts lining up to visit your establishment! The player in question finishes their turn and then everyone else gets one more turn before we move on to tallying up points.\nCards placed into your museum can be moved around as you see fit during the game as you search for those last items and perfect layout. At the end though you\u2019ll need to decide on your final layout before your museum opens!\nCollections are formed by placing cards orthogonally adjacent to each other, and consist of two categories: Civilisations (cards of the same colour) and Domains (cards with the same icon but different colours). The bigger the collection, the more points you can score!\nOnce everyone has finished organising their collections, your museum opens its doors to the public (with no small amount of pomp and circumstance) and we move into final scoring to see who wins!\nFirst take the points you scored during the game and add those gained from your collections. You can also convert any remaining Prestige points into victory points too.\nYou then score points for your Patron card as well as your museum\u2019s layout. If you managed to amass a big enough collection and fill your Grand Gallery (the red slots on the board) and/or your Entire Museum, you score even more points!\nFinally, players lose points based on the Public Opinion tokens on the board. Each card in your discard pile belonging to a continent with at least one Public Opinion token loses you points! The more tokens there are, the more points you lose!\nYour fellow curators will of course do the same and once scores have been tallied up, the player with the most points wins!\nThis is of course a summary or Museum\u2019s rules. If you\u2019d like to read the full version, you can find the work in progress Rulebook below.\nClick to download.\n Please note that this is a work in progress and not representative of the final product.\nMuseum is, at its heart, a set collection game. It's family orientated with just the right amount of rules and player interaction. Additionally, it can be tailored to suit more casual or younger players by easily removing elements such as Personnel, Events, Notoriety cards or Public Opinion to create an even easier, quicker, yet just as fun to play game. You can then add the different modules back in as the players become familiar with the rules and want to challenge themselves more.\nFor the more seasoned players out there though, don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve forgotten about you. Museum is a simple game compared to some, but it doesn\u2019t lack depth. Whilst the game has been designed with a family setting in mind, some of you may have noticed some of the subtler nuances whilst perusing the rules above. From manipulating discard piles to \u201ctaxing\u201d highly sought-after cards, there\u2019s more than a few ways for gamers to get their kicks! On top of this, upcoming expansions will allow you to add other elements to the game and create a much more cerebral challenge!\nYou can watch a full 4 -player game of Museum here:\nYou can also watch a video explanation of Museum's rules with Jamie here:\nStill not convinced that you want to back Museum? This video by Rahdo might change your mind!\nBarry Doublet from Board Games Everybody should has made a video about Museum !\nYou can also read his written article here!\nInterested in the World's Fair Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nInterested in the Archaeologists Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nWe'll be posting lots more video content during the campaign, including interviews with the game's authors and opinions from reviewers from around the world!\nWhat would a good KS be without Stretch Goats? As we move further and further through the project you'll unlock more and more content including plenty of exclusive elements that will enrich your pledge!\n From the seedy underworld of the Black Market, to the prestigious heights of the World Fair, there\u2019s more to the world of Museum than meets the eye!\nHow do I include add-ons in my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page.\n2. On the next screen, click on the blue \u201cChange your pledge\u201d button.\n3. Then, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the add-on and then click on the green \u201cContinue\u201d button.\n4. A new window will appear, click on the blue \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\nCurrently the game design for Museum is complete. You can see prototype copies of the game being played in the reviews and videos shown on this page. Whilst we\u2019re very happy with the game\u2019s current state, there may well be a few final modifications and checks to be made before we\u2019re fully satisfied with the final result.\nAs for stretch goals and other content we may unlock during the campaign: The game design for the majority of these elements have been tested and finalized. Any remaining queries should be resolved not long after the Kickstarter has ended. The brunt of the remaining work lies in the illustration work as you may have guessed.\nThe Core game is around 80% complete whereas the expansions require significantly more work. This has of course been taken into account for the announced delivery date. As Vincent finishes the illustrations the rest of the team will be working on pre-production so that the game is ready to be sent to print as soon as possible. We\u2019re planning for production to begin in late March in order to hit our planned delivery date of late July/early August.\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind.\nOlivier Melison and Eric Dubus have known each other for over 30 years, during which time they have played a huge selection of games together! Museum was born from their mutual desire to create a historically-themed game. When they're not creating amazing games together, Olivier works in international publishing, and Eric is a history teacher.\nVincent Dutrait is one of, if not the most, respected illustrators in the board gaming industry. Having worked on over 50 different projects (including Lewis & Clark, New York 1901, Robinson Crusoe, Broom Service, Lovecraft Letter, T.I.M.E. Stories, Augustus & Tikal 2...) his unique style of illustration and graphic design is popular with both players and publishers alike. He has also had the opportunity to work on prestigious licences such as Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer Fantasy, Pathfinder, Cthulhu and Games of Thrones.\nHoly Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns) Vincent Dutrait (renowned illustrator and artistic director) , and Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author).\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue to do what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go. In the case of Museum, it has allowed us to justify the extensive art budget that we wanted to attribute to the game. Simply put, games like Museum and/or their content would just not be viable with a \"traditional\" publishing method.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by August 2018. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, fabrication and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nMeeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions whereas Shipnaked will be taking care of North America and other worldwide destinations.\nAs mentioned previously, Shipping costs are not included in your pledge. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase. \nCurrently the shipping for this project is both EU, US and CA friendly. What does this mean? It means that backers from these two regions will not have to pay any import tax whatsoever when they receive their game.\nHowever, even if your region is not covered by this: please rest assured that our dispatcher will ensure you pay the absolute minimum in tax or brokerage for your game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo crowdfunding project comes without risk but we have done our utmost to minimise it.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, we have been involved in many Kickstarters before so are very familiar with any potential pitfalls.\n\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating an August 2018 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We are thankful for their contributions and plan on advancing the tabletop experience.\nThis Water Feature Collection was created for our personal AD&D campaign. While designing a Dark Elf Cavern* deep in the Underdark we wanted a reason for our players to interact with the terrain.  We came up with the idea of having a bunch of pool, spouts and bowls that have random magical effects. Drawing up a d20 water effect generator, characters that drink from the waters experience an effect for a short time.\nFantasy RPG: Its nice to be able to print terrain that will work with your Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder campaign that looks great and have an interaction effect! As stated above we have play tested random temporary effect for players that drink from the waters.\nDrinking from the waters could cause the adventurer to instantly cluck like a chicken gaining +5 initiative on the next encounter or whistle a quick melody gaining +5 to next dexterity check or the water could restore d4 health.  Not all waters offer a benefit some could require the adventurer to eat rations or suffer d4 damage.  Great concept and adds great value for interaction with the terrain.\nSiFi Gaming: Spacefinder!

They can easily blend into other terrain pieces I have or standout as needed. I would certainly recommend them to any who actually has a 3d printer. \nDave from Draven's RPG Review: I'm sure any gamers out there who own a 3D printer would love to make their own terrain, and these designs are some of the nicest I've ever seen.\nDave also posted an unboxing video and showed each piece. - Unboxing Video \nIn Game Mechanics: When a players drink from the waters they will be granted a temporary effect. Once a player drinks from the water source they are numb to receiving the effect again until after a short or long rest.  However! the water effect changes the next time the player drinks from it, have player roll for effect result.  The water when collected into a vessel loose the effect so it can't be stored for later use.  Most of the effects wear off quickly but some wear off after a short or long rest.  In general we do not stack effects.  We let the player who drinks the waters roll a d20 and read off the taste and effect for everyone to hear.  Lastly, you can change the effects, taste, let effects stack or even let players store some collected water if you wish, its your campaign Have Fun!\n  Possibilities: With 3d Printers we are able to make complex pieces in a single print which is drastically different from the traditional method of making the same piece using molds. With molds a complex design piece require us to make parts and then glue them together to create the same type of piece. Designing gaming terrain using software gives us the ability to make high definition simple AND complex terrain designs at a level not seen until now.\nWith that in mind we have every intention of taking advantage of this technology and pushing tabletop gaming terrain/scenery to an unparalleled level, this is just the beginning.\nWe See Eye to Eye: We want you to know we are doing this for both of us! You have a 3d Printer and are already part of the future or perhaps getting ready to jump in.  All you need is someone to design new quality content at a fair price, We promise you, we will continue to make affordable designs and offer discounts on our crowd funding campaigns.\n3d Printers in 2017: 3D Printing is affordable and easy to use! Currently there are good 3d printers such as the Monoprice Select Mini v2 pricing in at just over 200$ and PLA plastic for printing is less then 20$. With your own printer and files everyone can now make unlimited pieces for your tabletop gaming adventures.\nBackstory: A few years ago my wife and I created Mystic-Realm and began creating tabletop gaming terrain. Sculpts were made by hand using clay and a full range of tools. We made silicone molds and hand casted each piece using resin. Together we painted each peace offering them on eBay and our website. It has been an incredible experience with lots of fun and now we are moving into the future with 3d printing. This campaign is the first step in that direction. Once this campaign is over each piece will be listed on our website at 2$ per piece.  This is your chance to get the collection at a discount with free stretch goals as they unlock. We are looking for hardcore gamers like yourselves who love tabletop gaming with high quality 3D terrain.\nThis is the beginning of a loyal partnership with you. Thank you for believing in us, thank you for being our partner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNearly every design is complete, we just need a little bit more funding to finish the last few models. By the time the crowd funding campaign comes to a close we expect to have 100% of the plans ready for download.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

Dragon / Human size comparison (Dragon supplied unpainted. Leo not supplied at all)\nThe Dragon is supplied with the Archangel Saint Michael, one bombard, two artillerymen, ruins, 4 hexes, 6 hexagons of destruction and a special scenario featuring the Dragon, played by one player, and an army of human soldiers assisted by angels, played by the other players (1 or 2).\nClick here to find out more about this Add-On\n\u201cI loved loved loved this, and spent two days with the scenario bubbling in my mind around the other tactical options I could have taken!\u201d\nWarren (Beasts of War)\n\u201cThe miniatures are all cool.

Had a great time playing it.\u201d\nSam Healey (The Dice Tower) - in the Top 3 of the best games that Sam played at Gen Con 2017.\n\u201cTime of Legends: Joan of Arc stole the show for us. Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

Backers may, however, double their rewards by doubling their pledge amount (for example, $40 for two copies of Near and Far: Amber Mines, and then add shipping only once). Backers may not triple or quadruple their rewards, etc.  \nIt is possible that Near and Far: Amber Mines will be printed later by international publishers in various languages.

Much of the art is finished and the game is ready, but it won't see the light of day without the funds needed to see that the game is printed.\n\nThere are many other challenges to making sure this project is successful. Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games. My experience helps me ensure a smooth pre-production process.\n\nWith your help, we can have the funds to print the game, overcome the various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you are delivered a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "SINGLE ITEM: Underforest Printed Book", "descp": "For Above and Below.

You can already find the new Kickstarter page here. Please hit the 'notify me on launch' button so you can back us right from the start. You can find more information about the relaunch in the latest update. Thanks!\nAbout The Game:\nGame Outlines\nHeropath is a fantasy game that incorporates features of classic Eurogame\nIn this story, the heroes join together to eradicate evil forces from their land. Although heroes start the game together, they end up each on their own path experiencing unique places, facing vicious monsters and struggling to gain power. The hero that obtains the most power will be the one to slay the dragon.\nEach hero will need to tactfully decide when to cooperate and when to be deceitful. As evil continues to rise throughout the game, the real competition is not against fellow heroes but rather the game itself.\nHeropath is played with 2 to 4 players, although there is an option to play with 6 players (with expansion packs).\nThis game doesn't just incorporate battle strategies, but also requires precise logistic planning and efficient resource management.\nGame Features\nTesters reviewing the game: Heropath\nPLAY\n\nGame Innovations:\nThis game combines a fantasy game with a Eurogame by incorporating three preexisting mechanisms:\n        1. CDR - Card Draft Rotation\n        2. FOW - Fog Of War\n        3. SOE - Scale Of Evil\nMechanism Description:\n Regarding mechanism 1 - CDR\nCDR enables the accumulation of power and players being able to choose their preferred game approach. This is done by; shuffling the cards between all players before the game begins, and allowing each hero to collect their preferred tools and methods.\n Regarding mechanism 2 - FOW\nSame FOW as in the classic computer game Warcraft, where a vast map was displayed to the player. Although in Heropath the map has thick, black smoke covering the land. In beginning stages the smoke effectively hides unrevealed spots where enemies are hiding. This effect will materialize as players advance further in the game.\n Regarding mechanism 3 - SOE\nIn this game, players must manage their steps wisely. With every advancement and power gain, your companions (who are playing against you) are advancing as well.\nThis creates harder battle arenas. Due to fear of losing, heroes may skip the station where the weak dragon is hiding, and in turn they are left defeated.\nResource Management\nIn this game, you must manage your resources more efficiently than that of the opposing participants. The more the heroes advance, the enemies\u2019 power advance as well. The game does not sit idly.\n  Player Interaction\nOne of the interesting features included in this game is the direct player interaction.\nIn so many games, especially Eurogames, there can be such little interaction that players can go almost the entire game without running into each other.\n     The interaction in this game raises the bar to the next level, unlike Eurogames, this game includes:\n1. Trading between heroes\n2. Stealing from other heroes\n3. Causing direct and indirect damage by using accessories/magic  \n4. Ambushing and tossing other players into the Goblin Prison\nAll of these interactions are happening while players remain oblivious to the fact that the game itself is simultaneously causing conflict and damage to the participants. The game wants to unexpectedly undermine you, and ultimately defeat you with your own preferred playing method.\nExpansion I: With Allies\n\"Now I shall haunt you, until you know the wrath of the flames, for this is my vengeance.\"\nIf one year ago, the Giant had been told how and where his life would take him, no one would have believed it, let alone heard of the goblin-slaying Giant. If only it wasn't for that one damn winter, up until then, our friend was a peaceful farmer, content with his share. He bothered no one and no one bothered him, until that goblin raid from the Caves of Doom \u2013 the night when their fury torched 1,000 straw huts, the night when the dank air was filled with the sounds of screams and weeping. That was also the night when, from the fire, the pain and the grief, a hero was reborn \u2013 and the legend was born as well \u2013 of the Giant who fought back. The Giant who faced everyone \u2013 and returned the favor twice over.\nIn this expansion:\nExperience a wide variety of additional, diverse events. Marvel at new abilities that will grant you new powers.\nGather companions to join your campaign!\nEnjoy the new additional dice. Get a new \"Giant\" character to enrich play.\n- You can now play alongside more friends in a wider, richer saga, as well as increase the number of participants by one more player!\nIf you buy more expansions, you can increase the number of participants up to 6 players!\nExpansion II: Fire and Light\n\"In dark times \u2013 in your hour of need \u2013 I shall return to you \u2013 that is my way.\"\nThese words were known to famed isolationists and those in-the-know as the final prophecy left by the Wizard. To others, it was no more than a rumor or a fable told to little children. But when the cursed hour arrived, and swarms of enemies sprouted from every hill, crevice and tunnel, it was also that hour \u2013 the hour foretold. The strange thing about prophecies, as you know, is that no one really believes in them, until he appeared\u2026 out of the darkness, the light appeared, and it shined in all colors and flashes, and the ground trembled at his feet \u2013 as he whispered under his breath: \"Dance, you fools, dance all the way from here to hell\u2026 dance, but do not forget to whisper to the dragon on your way\u2026 the wizard is back \u2013 your time is over.\"\nIn this expansion:\nAdditional assortment of interesting and festive events. Discover additional abilities that will transform your play. Study new and exciting magic spells to learn new fighting techniques.\nEnjoy the new function of magic dice!\nGet a new \"Wizard\" character to re-diversify play. You may cast fire spells at enemies or lightning spells against the dragon!\nYou can now play alongside more friends in a wider, richer saga, as well as increase the number of participants by one player!\nIf you buy more expansions, you can play with up to 6 players!\nNote: this \"expansion\" cannot be used without the Heropath \"core game\".\nLink to publisher website: http://unique-games.com\nIn this video, we tried to give you a glance at the spirit of the game.\nPLAY\n\nGetting the board game - Shipping information\nWe will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter has finished, based on the actual costs and information provided by our pledge manage after the campaign ends.\nWe do our best to keep shipping costs to a minimum.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are located, we will either ship to you from our hubs in; the UK, China, or the USA.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (5 kg weight for core box). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may vary depending on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\n\u2022 USA: $25-$30 to most states.  \n\u2022 CANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.  \n\u2022 ASIA: $40 -50$\n\u2022 OCEANIA: $30-$65.  \n\u2022 OTHERS $35-$95  \n\u2022 EUROPE: $25-$35\nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the closest usable hub at a later date, and will likely incur increased shipping costs. We will update you on estimated shipping boxes once we have the final box layout and dimensions sorted. All shipping will be done by carefully selected shipping partners, to minimize any chance of damage to the shipment!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have play tested this for 100+ hours, in events, even at the Spiel Essen fair, and will continue to do so during the next few months as we gather feedback. Therefore the game may be subject to change, which may affect our delivery schedule.\n\nWe also invite our backers to provide feedback on the current game version, this may change the exact number and types of components that will make go into the final game.\n\nWe are almost finished with the art behind the game, and are working closely with our manufacturers, although due to manufacturing and shipping there may be unexpected delays. \n\nPotential delays may occur with products that are produced in China. Common delays are often found in; production, shipping and customs. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nREFUND GUARANTEE \nWe have prepared as much as possible for a successful production and Kickstarter. Although, if the game for any unforeseen reason cannot be deliver we will refund pledges according to the amount we received (after fees are applied).\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the Heropath\u2019s final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project. \n\nAfter sending our confirmation e-mail, you have an 8-week period to get back to us confirming your pledge.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week period has ended. \n\nPlease verify that your address can accept packages sent through normal shipping, unfortunately we cannot deliver to P.O. boxes.\n\nIf these terms are not acceptable to you, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign, and purchase the game when it is released.

A nice starter printer that can print these files starts around $220 (see our F.A.Q. for more info on printers, printing costs, filaments, and more.)\nEven if you don't currently own a 3D printer, it benefits you to support this campaign now.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played.

Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder.

Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1.

Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved!

It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings.

As a result, you've unlocked every stretch goal I could throw at you. The game is now bigger and better than I could have imagined. Thank you!\nRead Bod's full review here.\nI was inspired to create Forest of Fate by the gamebooks of my childhood, the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkein and Terry Pratchett, and the amazing and varied scenery near my home on the South West coast of England.\nMy goal was to make roleplaying games more accessible by stripping back almost all the conventional elements, revealing a strong procedural storytelling experience that is:\nEasy to grasp and \"safe\" for new players\nSelf-contained, and quick to play\nEndlessly replayable\nI hope I've succeeded!\nForest of Fate uses nothing but a storybook and high-quality cards for its unique brand of survival storytelling. It's compact enough to take anywhere, and has no small parts to lose!\nCheck out some of the gorgeous character art by the brilliant Milly Hanson:\nThe Thief\nThe Bard\nThe Ranger\nThe Warrior\nHere's a simplified interaction between a Character and an Encounter, to demonstrate the anatomy of the most important cards.\nThe Story Book is the heart and soul of Forest of Fate. It contains 1,164 paragraphs to spark your imagination, describing the encounters you'll face and the actions you'll take.\nA computer rendering of the Deluxe Story Book (Hero tier and above)\nYou have three choices when it comes to using the Story Book:\nThe content and gameplay for all three versions is identical, though I recommend the digital version - it can be updated later if we spot mistakes, and more importantly helps to save the forests we love!\nI've tried to make all rewards simple and fair. Please note that this campaign will not be using a pledge manager. Once it's over, it's over. If you've got your eye on something you should grab it while you can!\nForest of Fate is the debut game from Cards of Fate. As a startup publisher without a great deal of capital to invest or a name in the industry, I view Kickstarter as an exciting opportunity to help build a small community around my games and reward those who share my vision.\nPlaytesting (all components pictured are early prototypes, not final)\nThank you for reading, and I hope I've inspired you to try Forest of Fate.\nThanks also to the fine folk at Tabletop Audio for the ambient forest sounds used in my videos.

Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal service.\nWe expect to fulfill all rewards from within the EU, and as a result EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT \nShipments to backers outside of the EU will have the most updated EUR-equivalent value for each pledge level declared as the value of the package. For example, 25 USD is currently 21 EUR. That's roughly an equivalent of 31,5 CAD / 31,5 AUD / 24 CHF / 2 754 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees. \nTracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. \nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Hungary, Russia, Asia, South America, Africa or Antarctica. \nWe are confident the game we present to you is really good. Nevertheless, for your convenience we offer a satisfaction guarantee: a 100% return policy within 6 months counting from date of successful delivery, if you are not satisfied with the product. No questions asked. We will refund your full pledge amount, but we\u2019ll ask you to cover the cost of sending the game back to us. \nEnchanters is a fantasy card drafting game. As an Enchanter you create an artifact and upgrade it each turn. Every card you take retains some of its power. As you grow stronger, you can take on more powerful monsters and, if you plan well, even defeat a dragon.\nTo setup a game just:\n1. Give each player 5 crystals.\n2. Shuffle the Kingdom decks (one per player) together.\n3. Place 6 cards (Items and Enchantments only) on the Journey Track.\n4. Choose a Village Card.\n5. Pick the first player.\n6. You're ready to play.\nPlayers take turns to embark on quests: you collect cards from the Journey Track by paying with crystals. Cards go into two stacks: the Item Stack (here you put cards like \u201cLong Sword\u201d), and the Enchantment Stack (where you play titles, like \u201cof Fire\u201d). Combined, they create a \u201cLong Sword of Fire\u201d. The cards grant both temporary bonuses (upper icons and skills) and/or permanent ones (bottom icons).\nPlayers may also attack approaching monsters and defeat them in a simple combat encounter to score points. In combat, you compare your Defense against the monster's Strength to determine whether you receive damage. Then, you need to accumulate as much Attack as the monster's Health to defeat it. You keep defeated cards as trophies.\nFrom time to time, you rest in the village to gain crystals or heal wounds. If you do, discard the first card from the Journey Track.\nAt the end of each turn replenish the Journey Track to 6 cards.\nThe game ends when the last card is taken or discarded.\nWant to know more? See Richard 'Rahdo' Ham play:\nHere\u2019s the rulebook: \n  Note: Rulebook is not final, but really close to it. We\u2019re open to your feedback. \nWant to check out the Enchanters yourself? Just download, print and play. You\u2019ll just need some tokens to count crystals and wounds. The decks you find inside are what you need to play a full game. \n   Or try the game out on Tabletopia:\n  While Enchanters was thoroughly tested, we always welcome your feedback. Feel free to make suggestions and ask questions in the comments section.\n              First of all, Enchanters will not be published internationally without your help.  \nWe\u2019re still a relatively small independent publishing house. In 2016, we designed and published the Enchanters in Poland (under the name Zaklinacze). \nWhile the Polish edition was well received, we are cannot wait to share the game with the rest of the world. We know the game is good, we\u2019ve seen hundreds of players enjoy it - hardcore players and families alike. We had some time since the first run to make the game even better. We hope that reaching the stretch goals will allow us to show the Enchanters to the world in full glory.  \nOther companies in Poland approached us with publishing deals, but we turned them down. We decided to stay independent, make a name for ourselves, maybe go full-time one day. You can help us make this dream come true.\nOnce the game is funded, you will be one of the first to get it (maybe with the exception of Essen attendees). Also, once the game goes to retail, we expect the price to go up from the $25 Kickstarter price \u2013 that depends on the stretch goals we manage to unlock.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you see, we have very short delivery time. This begs a question, how do we do that?\n\n1) Both graphic design of the game and illustrations on the cards are 90% ready, since the game had a first edition in Poland last year.\n\n2) The production facility that we use (Trefl for cards, Mediagold for the rest) are located in our home cities. We worked together in the past and have booked their printing equipment ahead of time for this project.\n\n3) Gindie publishing house, the business Jacek is the owner of, is making t-shirts and gadgets for polish webcomics. He has rich experience in shipping and proven crew working every day of the week. \n\n4) The Polish edition of Enchanters was also crowdfunded. That campaign taught us a lot. We don\u2019t intend to repeat our mistakes.\n\n5) Our professional background gave us skills to do this right. All of us are working in video game development - an industry that provides even more challenges than board games.\n\n6) Last but not least, Ludi Creations, our partner in this endeavor, is a Kickstarter veteran.

Lucky for me, Canadian game designer, polyglot, traveler and all-around lovely human being Maxime Rioux (above left) volunteered his services. \nFor more than a year and a half we've been brainstorming, designing, scrapping, re-designing, experimenting, tinkering and testing, testing, testing.\nWe started long distance (I live in Germany, Maxime in Quebec), using a half-defunct web-based software called Tabloro to fiddle and test, including many very fun sessions with Itchy Feet fans over Skype (thank you, friends!).\nThen we played with handwritten flash cards, refining and re-jiggering and trying new ideas. We've been absolutely ruthless with it, only hanging on to the very best parts and cutting away any and all fat. \nWe wanted to create a game that was: \nSimple to learn\nInteractive\nFun to replay again and again\nNeither of us are huge gamers, so this was a high bar. It had to be something that we would love. With Itchy Feet: the Travel Game, we really believe we've succeeded. Our testers have been knocking our door down, wanting to keep playing.

The main mechanic is action selection with advanced resource management and an optional focus on area control. Game play generally takes 15-30 minutes per player.\nThe game was written and engineered over the course of several years by lifetime gamer, graphic designer, and branding consultant Marc Neidlinger, with the help of hundreds of play testers, artists, writers, and game enthusiasts.\nGame Play Overview\nThe game begins: thrown overboard for a life of wretchedness, you wash ashore a hostile island ruins. Through advanced resource management, area control tactics, and freeform action selection, you\u2019ll add companions to your party, acquire bizarre relics, attain potent character traits, and defeat a host of unusual monsters in the ultimate goal of mastering heroic attributes \u2014 and regaining honor.\nYou perform 3 actions on each turn in the order you feel is most advantageous that turn: activate a companion, travel to a new location, and interact with a map tile\u2014taking advantage of a few free actions along the way. Many actions require the the use of your influence to gain attributes in a one-of-a-kind heroic attribute alchemy system, which is leveraged to gain the game's most powerful rewards. For example, you can meditate at a spire to gain inspiration. You can train at a fort to gain strength. But then you can combine your inspiration and strength to gain courage (inspired strength) which allows you to defeat monsters.\nAs you exert your influence to attain heroic attributes, build your party, and embark on your adventure, you'll find over 100 unique card abilities that can be merged in unusual ways to create potent combinations...only some of which will come out each game.

We've already approached the fulfillment companies for estimates and processes. We feel confident because we are using established fulfillment companies who have depth of experience specifically in the gaming industry.\n\nWhile this is Orange Nebula's first crowdfunding project (as creators), we have been in business for over 4 years under this name, with a full-time staff of 5 plus half a dozen steady contractors. We have carefully prepared for this project, including high levels of communication with manufacturers, fulfillment companies, financial institutions, tax and legal specialists, and a handful of other vendors.\n\nAs you are reading this, 90% of the design production and high-res digital file preparation is already completed. As a creative agency, we are experts at file preparation and print production, so there will be no delays on our end in that regard. All of the files for the miniatures are already built and ready to rock.\n\nIn terms of fulfillment, there will undoubtedly be a few bumps along the way -- there always are a few -- but we are committed to doing the right thing even when nobody is looking. This is our reputation. Our vision is to make the gaming industry stronger and smarter, and it is our privilege to be a part of it all.

Don't panic! Click the image to be automatically directed to where you can order Overworld!\n  Overworld is a competitive tile-placement, territory control, and exploration board game for 2-4 Players with a 1-player Solo Quest Variant! It was designed by Nemo Rathwald for ages 14+ and plays in about 30 minutes. The most beautiful thing about Overworld is its elegance in simplicity; it takes only 5 minutes to teach but mastery will only develop after many, many plays.\nIf you enjoy games like...\nCarcassonne\nAlhambra\nTakenoko\nTsuro\nThen Overworld should especially resonate with you!\nIn Overworld, players act as explorers piecing together bit by bit the map of the Overworld by placing specially designed interlocking tiles drawn from a bag onto an expanding world map and adding your explorer tokens onto any new tile you explore. The interlocking teeth will only allow you to place your tiles in legal locations, making gameplay very smooth and easy to learn. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\" \nEnclosed gaps will eventually form in the landscape, and in these gaps are where elusive Dungeons are discovered. Discover the Dungeons furthest apart from one another and control the most territory with your explorers riding Umbirds and Ships to win!\nOverworld is the second installment of our Super Nano Enhanced Series, which began with Fire of Eidolon (shipping now worldwide!) This project will undergo several ENHANCEMENTS during the campaign which will upgrade the components and content of Overworld, and can be unlocked via Backer total Stretch Goals, Funding Stretch Goals, and Social Media goals, which will all be explained in detail below.\nEVERY BACKER MAKES A DIFFERENCE! Overworld is mechanically like a Euro-game but is also highly thematic and heavily inspired by the 16-bit era of Role Playing and Adventure video games of the 1990's. It is visually stimulating and loaded with stylistic parody and in-jokes that fans of retro videogames will appreciate while still being accessible and wholly enjoyable by everyone all within a unique, original, and compelling game that stands entirely on its own. We started the Super Nano Enhanced Series with Fire of Eidolon and we continue the tradition as you explore that world in ages past...in Overworld!\nOverworld came to Magic Meeple Games as a fully complete publish-ready game called Mirage which had been nearly published by another company before coming to us at Origins a couple years ago. We absolutely loved Mirage and saw an opportunity to re-theme the game to fit into our Super Nano Enhanced Series. With a new title and theme, Overworld has been under iteration and development for years and we feel it is finally ready for everyone to enjoy!\nEasy to learn and teach, difficult to master, immersive theme, and a new board every time you play!\nHere are some of the features you'll find in this game and in our Kickstarter campaign:\nGreat Gameplay! - High praise from reviewers, gamers, convention-goers of all ages for Overworld! \nHigh Replayability! - Overworld uses a brand new PUZZELOCK TILE SYSTEM and is never the same game twice! Procedurally generate the world as you play to make every game a brand new story!\nHigh Accessibility! - Overworld uses a very simple set of rules has an extremely gentle learning curve and is extremely easy to pick up and play! The game can be taught in about FIVE MINUTES and after playing a few times will players begin to understand the depth that Overworld offers!\nBacker-only Discounts! - After all Enhancements from this campaign, Overworld will have an MSRP of at least $35.99. Our Backers can get it right now for just $25 no matter how much content is added on through Enhancements and Stretch Goals! That's a savings of nearly $11 per copy!\nENHANCEMENTS! Stretch Goals! Achievements! - Your pledge WILL make the game better! Together we will make it awesome! Every backer matters!\nInteractive Kickstarter campaign - Throughout the campaign we will make decisions about Enhancements and features based on the feedback YOU provide in our update polls! Leave your mark on tabletop gaming history!\nSimplest Bundle Pricing on KickStarter! - Order as many copies of Overworld as you want at $25 each and pay shipping only for the first one! Just add $25 per extra copy and enter the total at the pledge confirmation screen. Boom. Done. No spreadsheets. No tricks.\nCustomer Support - It is our duty and honor to put your concerns at ease throughout the ENTIRE production process. Frequent updates during the campaign and no less than one update a month post-campaign until delivery. If you have a question or just want to say hello, reach out to us!\nand now for something NEW:\nMONEY-BACK SATISFACTION GUARANTEE - We're borrowing a page from Stonemaier Games and offering a Money-back guarantee with the Overworld project! Within one month of receiving Overworld, if you're unhappy with the product and customer service you've received, just send the game back to us and we'll issue a full refund of your original pledge!\nNemo Rathwald's Puzzelock Interlocking Tile Design solves the #1 problem with tile-placement games!\n  Did you run out of play space? You can actually move this board and everything stays IN PLACE!\n  Questions? We're here to help! We aim to have 24-hour or less response time to all inquiries during the campaign!\n \nSuper Nano Enhanced Series games undergo many ENHANCEMENTS throughout the campaign, many are achieved like normal Stretch Goals, but some are special and will require involvement in the comments or on social media!\nHave a look at what we'e accomplished so far!\n      Click the image to visit our Twitter page!\n  And click HERE to visit our Facebook Page! \n  Measure the X/Y limits of your map and calculate your score much faster with this handy tool!\n  Towns and Sidequests now part of the Overworld package!\n  LINEN FINISH NOW INCLUDED!\n  You asked for it, and we've been saving it for the epic finish! Can we reach this high?\n    Your turn in Overworld is 4 simple steps: \n                                           Draw a Land Tile (from the bag) \nAttach it to another tile on the board (IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!) \nAdd Explorers to the Tile you added (one per segment, Umbirds for land, Ships for Sea) \nResolve Gaps! (Check for Dungeon discoveries!)\nJust how easy is it to play Overworld? Have a look!\nThe game will begin with a single Coastline Tile on the board. Begin your turn by drawing a Land Tile from the bag.\n  You may choose to place the tile LAND side up or SEA side up, as long as there is a place to connect it where the teeth fit without obstruction. IF THE TEETH FIT, IT'S LEGIT!\n  After placing a Land Tile, place three of your Explorer tokens on it, Umbird tokens explore LAND, and Ship tokens explore SEA. Each player gets seven of both to Explore the Overworld!\n  Yellow's turn is over, play continues in this way as Red and White each get a turn...until a gap is created into which no other tile can fit, then a Dungeon is discovered!\n  Dungeons are Discovered by counting up all of the Explorer tokens belonging to each player in all regions connected ORTHOGONALLY to the gap. Yellow has the most Explorers connected to this gap and gets to claim the Dungeon discovery.\nExplorer tokens (Umbirds or Ships) that are used to Discover a Dungeon (i.e. those belonging to the player that had the most and placed their dungeon door in the gap) are returned to that player to be used again, the others stay on the board!\nTake note that player White placed the tile that gave player Yellow that Dungeon! This is a very important tactic that you will need to deprive your opponents of territory!\nIf there is a tie, the player who placed the tile gets to decide who breaks the tie and gets the Dungeon Discovery. \nPlay continues until no more tiles remain in the bag, then scoring begins.\nEND OF GAME\nYou collect points for the Explorer tokens you still have in play, and the total distance of the shortest path (in Orthogonal spaces) around all of your Dungeon doors in play, door-to-door-to-door. Like this:\n  Click here to see the complete End Game scoring ruleset!\n    CURRENT GAME CONTENTS:\nThis list will change and evolve as we unlock Stretch Goals and add Enhancements! \nBox & Rulebook - Similar size and style as a 16-bit video game's box and manual!\n32x PUZZELOCK Land Tiles - Double-sided and Die-cut with our special Puzzelock design that physically prevents invalid tile placement. \"IF IT FITS, IT'S LEGIT!\"\n28x Umbird Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n28x Ship Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n12x Dungeon Door Tokens - Basic funding goal will make chipboard tokens, Enhancement goals will make them laser cut meeples!\n4x Quick-Reference/Faction Cards - Poker-Sized Cards - Never forget a rule or which color belongs to which player with these handy Quick-Reference/Faction cards! THANK YOU TO OUR DAY-1 BACKERS!\n1x Tile Bag - For randomization of tiles, through Enhancement goals, this could become a luxurious drawstring cloth bag with an embroidered design!\nExtra Zip-Lock Baggies - To carry everything and keep it organized!\nEXPANSION CONTENT PLANNED - To be revealed via Stretch Goal Enhancements. Planned content includes: Solo play and more than one Mini-Expansion!\nBONUS! Every copy of Overworld sold here will include an exclusive promo for our previous project, Fire of Eidolon! Thank you to all of the backers that helped us get here today!!\n  Throughout the campaign we will add additional goals to meet beyond our base funding goal. Each of those goals we achieve will add another ENHANCEMENT to Overworld. Some of these Enhancements will behave like traditional Stretch Goals which most are familiar with, but some will be different and put more focus on Backer Participation.                       \nThere are several ways to help support the Overworld project, here is more information about each available Pledge level to help you decide how you can support our project!\n                                                                                                                                                                                              Not enough Reviews for you?

The SECOND best thing you can do to help Overworld is to spread the word and share our campaign on all of your favorite Social Media sites! Here are some fun social media avatars you can use to help express your fandom! Collect them all!\n      Or, use this to make your own and we'll post it here!\n  Increase our total reach by FOLLOWING Magic Meeple Games on Twitter!\n  Visit us on Facebook and LIKE our page to help us unlock additional ENHANCEMENTS!\n       Adding additional copies of Overworld to your Pledge will not incur additional shipping charges in this campaign. Add $25 to your Pledge for each extra copy if our built-in Pledge levels do not suit your needs. We will discount every pledge down to charging shipping on only the first copy of Overworld in each order!*\nRewards for this project will be shipped primarily from the USA. Distributor/Manufacturer may collaboratively ship some rewards from other countries to save on shipping and customs costs. For the Fire of Eidolon project, we ultimately opted for a combination effort using Amazon and SFC (Ship from China) as many highly successful Kickstarter projects have done and the results have been favorable!\nRather than lock ourselves in to a specific method of shipping, we analyze the order distribution at the time of manufacturing to find the most cost-effective and time-effective distribution options available to us. This is our commitment to you in our goal for constant process-improvement and to provide the best possible products that we can!\n*Shipping price is for delivery of one entire order to a single address. \nResidents of Brazil, Russia, and South America take note: to ensure your package is delivered, additional charges may be required to ensure delivery verification in certain regions of these countries. If these additional charges are not paid, the chances of lost packages in those regions increases sharply and our distributor is attempting to implement solutions to this problem. If you reside in any of these countries please inquire about your pledge before the end of the campaign as the $20 basic shipping charge cannot guarantee delivery in these countries. \nRegarding Customs: Our shipping partners offers what they call \"Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping\" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. If any VAT taxes or customs fees would apply to your order, we make sure those are pre-paid to make it easier for YOU! \nWhile we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in our ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. We have had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. If all of our efforts still do not meet your expectations, you are still protected by our Money-Back guarantee! Pledge with Confidence!\nDelivering your reward responsibly\nOur primary goal and responsibility as Magic Meeple Games is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for, at the level of quality they expect, and as quickly as possible. Magic Meeple Games and its partners have years of collective experience overseeing planning and production to ensure Overworld well be delivered to all backers in a timely manner. \nSo far, Magic Meeple Games has produced and shipped two feature projects. Darkrock Ventures, which has fully fulfilled; and Fire of Eidolon which has been partially fulfilled already and will complete fulfillment before this Kickstarter campaign is complete.\nWe have run into slight speedbumps with each of these projects which hinged on the final completion of graphics. We can be proud of the fact the amount of delay was reduced dramatically with the fulfillment of FoE as compared to DRV, but we can do better. This time, we have a fully graphic-designed rulebook completed IN ADVANCE for everyone to enjoy which means we won't be waiting on it before manufacturing. This project focuses on the physical components of the game and less on artwork, this will also help us accelerate our manufacturing process and get the game made that much faster.\nIn fact, it is our goal to enter manufacturing on this project by October, and ALREADY have prepared art, graphics, and rules all in advance to make this a realistic goal. We are challenging ourselves to make Overworld our best-record for delivery, we have laid out even more groundwork ahead of time and together we can make this possible! Thank you for your support!\nWe do not plan to use use the built-in survey system for the Overworld Campaign, after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will use PledgeManager to manage your orders and give everyone one last opportunity to add on to their pledge. There are no separate or hidden Add-Ons during the Kickstarter campaign, only the pledge levels. \nIf you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, or if you would like access to the special FoE Backer price on our previous projects, Fire of Eidolon and Darkrock Ventures, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. (PledgeManager will charge backers separately for any additional products added beyond what was pledged for in the Kickstarter.)\n    Seven hundred playtests. Two laser cutters. Twelve BoardGameGeekGold. Six Pez dispensers. The heat of a thousand suns. Boardgame designer Nemo Rathwald has most of these things. \nNemo's game design goals are:  \nInteresting choices\nLittle downtime\nLots of gameplay from as few rules as possible \nMultiple viable paths to victory \nComponents that physically don't let you break rules, so you don't have to remember them.\nNemo started searching the shelves for boardgames which turned out to only exist in his imagination. So he started making them so he could play them. He got into game design in 2003, at the first Penguicon (a convention of all geeky interests) and has been helping to run the convention ever since, where he playtests new board games of his own design every year.\nIn 2010, Nemo discovered i3Detroit hackerspace, a nonprofit community workshop with an educational mission in art and technology, where he volunteers as a Board Director, an Officer, and an Instructor. There, he upgraded his ability to make lavish show-stopping board game prototypes. Due to his experience in publishing, he fully illustrates and preps his games and rulebooks for pre-press in advance. In 2013 he changed careers from graphic design to web development. In 2014 he signed his first board game publishing contract at Protospiel, a convention for board game designers. \nNemo Rathwald carries a wheeled suitcase of board games in the trunk of his car at all times.\nHere is an unboxing video of our last production, Fire of Eidolon, so you can see the standard of quality we aim for with our projects!\nMagic Meeple Games, LLC. is a tabletop publishing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. By gamers, for gamers, we are Magic Meeple the Boardgame People! \nFounded, co-owned, and operated by a husband/wife team; We are passionate, lifelong tabletop gamers and we want to show that passion through the games we choose to design, develop, and publish. In our first campaign, Gamelyn Games partnered with us to elevate Magic Meeple Games to their level of quality and customer satisfaction straight out of the gate and we upheld that standard as we moved forward with our first solo campaign, Fire of Eidolon! Now we return for our THIRD Kickstarter project with hopefully many more to come.\nMagic Meeple Games origins began in the industry in 2007 through independent game design, company co-owner Ian Stedman is a published designer himself and has worked on several projects for several other publishing companies as a consultant and designed Magnum Opus for Clever Mojo Games. \nThis is the third core entry into our publishing catalog, and we drawn from the experience of designers, developers, publishers, distributors, manufacturers, and retailers all over the world. We would not ask for your pledges if we were not confident in our ability to fulfill the obligations we have set forth for ourselves.

It is prone to many surprises and problems, even for experienced publishers. \n\nFortunately our team is comprised of exceptionally experienced and talented individuals, with years of expertise in Game Design, Game Development, Print Publishing, Product Manufacturing, Project Fulfillment, Art, Technical Documentation, Retailer Support, Retail & Online Sales, Technology Support, Retail sales, and Graphics Design.\n\nWe co-published our first project, Darkrock Ventures, with the collaboration of the exceptionally experienced Gamelyn Games, and that project was a SUCCESS. Our first solo project, Fire of Eidolon was also a SUCCESS. We at Magic Meeple Games are proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have even more experience and knowledge in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nOur previous project fell a couple months short of our target Shipping date, and we have identified several contributing factors to that delay and have actively made improvements in our process to prevent the likelihood of such delays happening again.\n\nFor this project, we are focusing on a game which came to us very much complete. Additional features have been added and small tweaks have been made here and there, but suffice to say, the game is already finished and manufacturing-ready. All that is left is to put in the add-on content that is unlocked in the campaign, update the already designed fully-graphical rulebook (something that has been a challenge in the past) and send off the files. We have never been in a better position to go straight-to-print.\n\nWe are also expanding our horizons as we seek manufacturing and distribution, we are adapting to find better solutions to save time and money, this began by working with Discover Gaming Fulfillment with the distribution of Fire of Eidolon. Thanks to them, most of our backers have already gotten their rewards!\n\nDuring the manufacturing of Darkrock Ventures there was a technology failure that caused a delay that we could not control. This is just an example as things such as this cannot be helped no matter how prepared you may be. No project is immune to the possible mishap, but this road is familiar to us, our distributors, and our manufacturers and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. \n\nThank you for your confidence and support!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to customer service and backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present DAILY during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! We couldn't do it without you! Look what we accomplished together with DRV and FoE!

The Queen's tyranny is spreading into every corner of the kingdom. Her foot soldiers scour the countryside to hunt the behemoth\u2015a bewitched creature that was once her husband. Your small band of rebels will need sharp wits and a bit of luck to save the King and reclaim the land's virtue.\nThe Queen's Army is the highly anticipated solo variant expansion for the game Feudum, allowing you (and others) to play against an A.I. player! The elegantly crafted automa deck was developed in collaboration with J.R. Honeycutt (developer for Tesla vs Edison: Powering Up!) and Brian Neff. The game rewards wise resource management and requires cunning play to keep the queen's army at bay as it tries to thwart your rise to power!\nAdditionally, The Queen's Army is being localized in Germany with help from our friends at Spielschmiede! They will handle the german translation upon reaching their crowdfunding goal. All funding raised on Spieleschmiede will count towards unlocking stretch goals here!\nFeudum: The Queen's Army features a keenly designed A.I. player that cleverly reacts to game conditions and keeps you guessing with her unpredictable maneuvering.  Rounds are played just like the base game with alternating turns, round by round until each epoch is triggered. However, the Queen is less restrained by resource or route requirements making her a powerful force to reckon with! Players may face the Queen alone, or cooperate to defeat her (while still competing for the highest individual score).\nThe game's solo play is streamlined and elegant like the automa mechanics found in games such as Between Two Cities, Alhambra, Viticulture and Scythe. After countless play tests, developer Brian Neff concluded in the Queen's Army Development Journal that the game is an \"incredibly in-depth, challenging and fun experience.\"\nEnglish Available Now\nSolo Variant Preview: Developer J.R. delivers a rousing single round run-through of the Queen's Army.\nBase Game Complete Rules:Here is a wonderfully crafted animation of the entire rules with subtitles (cc) in English, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (LaAm), Dutch and Greek.\nIntricately crafted pawns and a majestic horse\nFeudum: The Queen's Army will feature meticulously-crafted components designed by award-winning artist Justin Schultz.

I was Inspired by Eurostyle games in the late 90s and became a fan of legends like Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Martin Wallace and Andreas Seyfarth. I unveiled my prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. I am grateful for Feudum's wonderful reception back in November of 2016 and thrilled by its ever growing community. Check out facebook.com/feudum  or BoardGameGeek to learn more. \nArtist\nAs he likes to put it, Justin Schultz is an \"earthling living in Jackson, Mississippi.\" Justin studied graphic design at Mississippi State University and worked for a number of advertising agencies before focusing on concert posters, album covers, package design and, just recently, board game art! His distinctive style of populating his art with monsters, reptiles and robots conjures up memories of children's picture books, albeit slightly skewed. Justin explains that he likes to lure viewers in with \"superficially charming images,\" but then reveal something more \"heartbreaking\" or \"daunting\" upon closer inspection.  In 2010, Justin started his independent studio, The Flying Chair.\nJ.R. Honeycutt & Brian Neff\nJ.R. Honeycutt, Developer\nJR Honeycutt is a game designer and developer. He works with Rob and Lindsay Daviau in their game design studio, and is the Tinker-in-Chief at Restoration Games.\nJR's work includes development on Legacy games SeaFall and Charterstone, and on multiple titles during his time with Artana.

They are powered by CoolStuffInc.com, a business that has been shipping games for over 14 years to customers around the world. Quartermaster Logistics will ensure your packages arrive safe and on time as every game is professionally packed and protected.\nHow it Works\nA short time after the campaign is over, you will receive an email from Backerkit that directs you to a pledge manager where you can confirm or upgrade your pledge, and add base games, expansions or other \u201cadd-ons.\u201d (PayPal accepted). \n\nYour Shipping will be automatically calculated at that time based on the total weight of your order. (Backerkit has automated this, so it is a lot easier now!)  Note: Rewards from the previous Kickstarter campaign may NOT be delayed to ship with this campaign. Each campaign is on an independent fulfillment schedule.\nBackerkit turns overpledges into a credit that may be used as you see fit in the pledge manager.   \nShipping Estimates \nThe rates below are good faith 2018 ESTIMATES of carrier rates (FedEx, UPS) plus freight.

When possible, QM Logistics will use the fulfillment centers that are closest to backers in order to save them money. (For example, fulfilling from China, for East Asia, or fulfilling others from the EU shipping.)

These Speaking Stones began humming and pulsing when the lost city of Lux reappeared after disappearing thousands of years ago. Those who respond to the stones and hone their power become known as Stonebound. These stones are equipped to their weapons and armor to enable feats of incredible power and skill unlike anything the world has seen.\n\nPlayers pre-construct or draft teams of stonebound who are training against each other in preparation for an impending battle against a force known as Tenebris.\n  Players track their character's stats and abilities using dashboards with sliders to track dynamic stats, and pegs to track activated abilities. Each stonebound comes with two ability cards that are placed into each dashboard.\nThe Stonebound Saga comes with 12 character dashboards.\nThere are 35 unique characters for players to choose their teams from spanning 7 different character classes.

TERRAIN CARD EXPANSION - 140 CARDS!\n      A completely new card type!\nOur final stretch goal is a major expansion for The Stonebound Saga!\n\nIntroducing 'Terrain Cards'! \nThe terrain card expansion will include 140 cards in a tuck-box included with the game. Each copy of the game will include this expansion.\nThere are 35 unique terrain card designs which is 5 cards per speaking stone element. There are 3 copies of each terrain card plus 1 description card to describe how the card is played.\n\nTerrain cards modify the spaces on the battlefield during gameplay. These cards can affect single spaces or groups of spaces. Terrain cards open up a completely new way to play the game, and add another level of strategy to the gameplay itself.\n\nIn addition to the character cards players will pick for their teams; players will now choose or draft a total of 10 stars of rarity from the 'Terrain Card' deck. Each player may not have more than 3 of the same terrain card in their deck.\nPlayers will be able to activate terrain cards in battle by using 'Speaking Stone' cards just like they do to use their character's abilities. It is wise to pick terrain cards based off elements that are not in use by their characters to ensure they will not have any unused resources each turn. Once a terrain card is activated the speaking stone cards are discarded.\n\nWhen a terrain card is played it can be placed on ANY OPEN space on the battlefield. (not occupied by a character or another terrain card) Once a terrain card is placed on the battlefield it can be used by ANY player. This means both positive and negative effects are in play for both players. Terrain cards bring about attributes from various places and effect the battle in many ways. Each card is an actual location from the world of Telios.\nThere are many types of terrain cards that can both help your allies, and hinder your enemy! Let's take a look at a few terrain cards, and how they work on the battlefield.\n      Ice Blocks can be used to block enemy forces, and force them to move around to attack, or use a turn to remove them. They are excellent for buying time for your forces, and even preventing enemy formations!\n      Valley of the Wind can be used in multiple ways. Not only can it increase the range of your ranged characters, but it can be used for surprise rush attacks and combinations.\n      Sapping Stones can be very effective at preventing your opponent from using healing abilities, or healing from attacks. With good placement there will be no area available to heal, but be careful this affects your team as well!\n      The massive trees of Illandris make attacking from a distance difficult, and placing this card on the battlefield can greatly hinder your opponent's ranged forces!\n      Any player who moves their character to this location gets to immediately draw 2 extra speaking stone cards (resources). This can greatly help a player with their draw mechanics, and setting up for using their character abilities.\n      Fortifications can be a great location to place your vulnerable characters in the middle of battle. This location mitigates HP damage allowing a character to survive longer, but be careful - your opponent can steal this location from you and use it to their advantage!\nThat was just 6 of the 35 unique terrain card designs! We hope you love this new card type that adds an incredible amount of strategy and a new way to play! We will be revealing more of the terrain card designs once this stretch goal is unlocked! Once we reach this stretch goal the 'Terrain Card' expansion will be added to every copy of the game!\n  Centuries ago there was a lush and beautiful land named Telios. In the center of this kingdom stood the gleaming city of Lux ruled by a wise and loving king. The citizens of Telios wanted for nothing and their hearts were full of joy. The king walked among the people taking delight in their lives and the people loved him dearly. One day a dark force known as Tenebris arose from the deep places of the earth and touched a single man. Tenebris flattered the man with lies and whispered to him of greatness. The man spent his days plotting and he lay awake each night dreaming of riches and power. With a honeyed tongue this one man swayed the thoughts of those around him and the darkness spread. Soon, bitterness and jealousy welled up in the hearts of the people and they became discontent.\nTenebris grew and festered until the people of Telios succumbed to darkness. Out of this darkness the people rose up in defiance to their king. They gathered from all corners of Telios uniting under a banner of darkness. They made for themselves weapons of war and steeled themselves with hatred. The very first army the world had ever known assembled in the fields of Lux and prepared to strike down their king. The king looked out over his people and wept, for even still he loved them. With a heavy heart he uttered unknown words of power and there was a great cataclysm. The city of Lux rose from the ground and ascended into the sky. Mighty earthquakes shook the land and tore it to pieces. Great fires erupted from the center of the earth pushing up mountains where fertile plains used to be. Massive storms raged across the earth\u2019s surface stripping the land bare and scattering the once grand army. People all over Telios cried out in despair until finally everything was still.\nThe world was changed. Great chasms had formed separating the land into seven continents. All that remained in the heart of Telios where the city of Lux once stood was a great void. The king was gone. His absence could be felt by everyone as a sudden and unexplainable loss. Without a king to unite them and reeling in despair, seven kingdoms arose from the newly formed continents and turned their hatred upon each other.\nThe seven countries of Telios\nThousands of years passed and the world knew only war. Grievance was heaped upon grievance until the shared history of the seven kingdoms was all but forgotten. It was an age of darkness and brutality. The land was sapped of its bounty and the people were sapped of their strength. They no longer remembered why they fought nor did they care. They were ruled by hatred, they were ruled by bitterness and they were ruled by death. It hung like a pall in the air mocking the pitiful creatures clawing upon the surface of Telios.\nWhen humanity was on the brink of ruin and all seemed lost, hope broke through.\nIt started with a whisper...\nIt started with a whisper, a nearly imperceptible voice carried on the wind echoing through canyons, sweeping over fields, and flowing into the cities. The first people to hear the voice could make no sense of it. It seemed a trick of the ear, teasing those who could hear it as the memory of a dream teases one upon waking. The words spoke of a long lost king and a magnificent race of people. It spoke of light shattering the darkness and it spoke of the king returning! These words settled on the land and were absorbed like a fresh spring rain until the very stones of the earth hummed and pulsed with their power. These stones soon became known as speaking stones as they were able to speak into the very souls of the people, granting them power to push back the Tenebris. The king also gave a warning through the stones; Tenebris, the great darkness which had consumed the earth, was gathering its forces for one final battle.\n\u201cIf no one speaks of His name; even the rocks will cry out.\u201d\n  When our team at Sky Kingdom Games began working on The Stonebound Saga over 15 years ago we knew that this project wasn't going to be just a board game. We knew that in order to create something unique we would need to create a world with rich stories, compelling characters, and lore.\nClassic games from Squaresoft (now Square Enix) like Final Fantasy Tactics, Chrono Trigger, and Secret of Mana had significant influence on this project. Part of what made those games so great was not only the story and characters, but the beautiful music that gave the games atmosphere and depth. You would expect a digital title to have a soundtrack, but you usually don't see board or card games with an OST! We are proud to provide a soundtrack to accompany gameplay for those that want to add music to match the play experience.\nTo capture the sound of The Stonebound Saga we reached out to music composer Bill Piyatut H. Bill is an accomplished composer and arranger of multiple titles and projects around the world. We are excited to be able to offer this soundtrack as a reward for every backer! At the end of the campaign we will be emailing each backer a link to download the soundtrack. Until then you can preview some of the tracks below.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 1st Kickstarter (re-launched from October and February), and also a very ambitious project! Knowing this we started preparing for this campaign over a year ago. We reached out to other successful publishers, asked questions, talked to the gaming community, and found the best way to produce and deliver a wonderfully crafted game using the Kickstarter platform.\n\nWith that said - here's some key points to consider.\n1. We spent time setting up friendly shipping options for our backers so any extra fees and VAT will be covered by us. The Stonebound Saga will ship from various shipment centers in the U.S., Canada, the EU, and Australia. This way shipping is simple and not over complicated! \n\n2. We put a realistic timetable on production and delivery for this game - which is by February 2018. We anticipate the game shipping before then, but we would rather under promise and over deliver! Keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\n3. We have an amazing art studio handling our art designs - Caravan Studio. Caravan has produced work for various companies like Blizzard, Lucasfilm, Wizards of the Coast, and others. We expect a great turn around in the remaining art needed to complete the game which will not hold up the production of the game.\n\n4. You can be assured that every possible precaution and care will be put into providing an incredible game in a timely matter and exactly as we promised. Our team has worked for years pouring our time and our own personal funds into crafting a game that we are proud to share with the world.

For a limited time, you can still pre-order the game. Just click on the \"Pre-Order\" button above!\nBuilding a city is no easy task. You would think so many races working to toward a common goal might make things easier, but everyone is just out for themselves, and too many dissonant voices cause only chaos.\nStill, building the legendary city of Gloomhaven is the task before you. Can your race use the resources of your opponents effectively enough to hold the most prestige when the city is complete? Can you leverage your influence and construct the building projects that will benefit your race the most?\nFounders of Gloomhaven is a competitive 2 hour city building game for 1-4 players. It is not an expansion to Gloomhaven, but a stand-alone Euro project that features a unique mix of tile placement, action selection, hand management, worker placement, and blind bidding.\nAll 18 stretch goals are included in all copies of the game!\n  In Founders of Gloomhaven, you will have control of a number of resources that you can place on the board as tiles.\nYou must combine your own resource tiles with those of your opponents to create more advanced resource tiles, and then deliver these resources to prestige buildings to earn points.\nThis is all accomplished through your decks of action cards. On your turn, you can play a card to take a variety of actions:\nTrade: Placing resource tiles or buying access to others' resources.\nRecruit: Hiring adviser cards to add to your deck, giving you more influence and extra powerful actions.\nUpgrade: Building advanced resources to increase your income and scoring opportunities.\nConstruct: Erecting personal buildings like houses and bridges, which will give you more control over the board state.\nYou can also call a vote, which will retrieve all the cards you have played, but doing so will allow all other players to collect income, and then it will trigger a blind vote on which new prestige building gets placed on the board and where it gets placed.\nPrestige buildings offer the major scoring opportunities in the game, so you would do well to control the vote whenever possible by spending influence, making sure the building which scores the resources you control is built.\nInterested in trying it out? No problem! One of my main Kickstarter goals is to give everyone the chance to really get in there and play the game before they back the project.\nThere are two main ways you can sit down and give the game a test drive.\nFirst of all, if you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, you can follow this link to the Founders of Gloomhaven module. There's no automation to the file, so you will still need the rule book handy.\nAlternately, you can download the print-and-play files to construct your own physical copy of the game. Currently we just have a high-ink version, but there will be a more printer-friendly version very shortly.\nHigh-Ink: [Double-sided 11x17 cardstock (2 pages)], [Single-sided 11x17 cardstock (8 pages)], [Map board]. (There are two copies of each tile so you can tape/glue them together to give the cardstock more weight and avoid any bleed issues.)\nLow-ink: [Full file - includes map] (Print it all single-sided, then tape/glue together the front and back of each tile.)\nKeep in mind that in all these versions, the art and design is not final and is subject to change.\nOr if you just want to watch someone else play the game, we have you well-covered there, too.\nIntroductory game play through from Rahdo:\nTwo-player full game run through from Tom Heath:\nThree-player full game run through from JonGetsGames:\nFour-player full game run through from Heavy Cardboard:\nSolo full game run through from Rolling Solo:\n      New to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.  \nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the city!\n$10 for shipping is included in the base price, which means there is no extra shipping charge for the US, Canada or China. All additional shipping fees for other countries are added automatically when you pledge.\nIn addition, the game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, Singapore, and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAlso note you can pledge for additional copies of the game by manually increasing your pledge amount, and you only have to pay the extra shipping fee for every three copies of the game. And don't worry if you can't do the math - the pledge manager will sort you out after the project ends.\nI am no stranger to slaying rats, destroying skeletons, and defacing board game components to honor and commemorate my wonderful Kickstarter supporters. This time around, however, instead of destroying things, I want to build.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar to the campaign, I will toil away in a variety of city-building video games and erect a grand structure in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come. You can watch the videos linked above to get a feel for what this will look like.\nThe main reward level will get you a copy of Founders of Gloomhaven, plain and simple, with no further effort required. All stretch goals are included.\nThere will be no add-ons, no Kickstarter exclusives, just the game delivered to your doorstep before it comes out in retail, at a significant discount off the expected retail price ($60-$70, depending on stretch goals).\nNot only that, but pledging to the Kickstarter gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. You will get weekly updates on the progress and development of the game.\nI love bringing games to Kickstarter because it gives me a chance to collaborate with this community, taking suggestions from the game's fans and using them to make the game better.\nFounders of Gloomhaven has been in development for over a year, and I am really excited to get it out into the world. As with all my designs, I believe it offers something unique and innovative to this great hobby, adding an incredibly high level of player interaction to the city-building genre and melding many disparate mechanics into a cohesive and engaging design.\nOnce you have played it, I hope you will feel the same way.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games. His first game, Forge War, was published three years ago, and his second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim back in February.

I will always let you know.\n\nAdmittedly, my delivery estimates have been off in the past, but with those mistakes in mind, I firmly believe that January is a very realistic goal to deliver this game to you.\n\nThere is a lot of art left to do, as well as some graphic design and making sure any mechanical changes or additions brought on by the Kickstarter process are implemented well, but all of us are dedicated to delivering this game to you in a timely manner.\n\nI also stand by the quality of the game and my customer service.

Communities Program and their fantastic Director, Julie Judkins for their ongoing partnership and friendship. As any long-distance hiker knows, the importance of trail communities cannot be understated. These communities anchor the Trail and provide critical services to hikers of all kinds -- especially those embarking on an extended journey. There are currently 41 designated A.T. Communities in the ATC\u2019s Program, and we want to extend a huge THANK YOU to them for sending us questions related to their community as contributions to the A.T. Communities Deck.

Kristin Peppel brings a background in conservation planning, trail community development, and environmental education.  Kristin worked closely with the ATC to design the current A.T. Community Program and has spent countless hours hiking on the A.T.\nThe Appalachian Trail Game was born on one of Mark's regular hikes between Max Patch and Hot Springs, NC after passing by Walnut Mountain shelter. It had been completely trashed, and after cleaning up the site and packing up the trash, he began envisioning a fun and engaging way to teach people about responsible trail ethics. Mark transformed his idea into a board game, and two years later, thanks to a small grant awarded through the Appalachian Trail Conservancy's (ATC) License Plate grant program, we were able to develop the prototype game. \nA small team of talented educators, artists, conservationists and backpackers formed to turn that prototype into a fully realized product, The Appalachian Trail Game. In August of 2014, we launched the game on Kicktstarter and were overjoyed with the response. We achieved our goal in the first 48 hours, and by the end of the campaign, we were over-funded by almost 600%. Since that time, we have sold over 15,000 copies and donated over 300 games to non-profit organizations, schools, and volunteer hiking clubs. The game has received rave reviews by teachers, hikers, A.T. volunteers, and players of all ages.\nIn 2015, we established new partnerships with Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics and the American Hiking Society to help create the new content for the Special Edition version of the game. We launched this game via a second successful Kickstarter campaign in August of that same year. We are proud to be part of the #ProtectYourTrail campaign that integrates various strategies to educate new hikers about Leave No Trace principles and ways to get involved with volunteer trail clubs.\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt Outdoor Edutainment, LLC we are committed to producing high quality products and refuse to take any shortcuts that impede this commitment. Having run 2 successful Kickstarter campaigns, (The Appalachian Trail Game - Backpacking Edition and the Special Edition), we know much better how avoid trouble and navigate the complexities of production, shipping and working within the Kickstarter platform. We are confident that these changes will ensure that all customers get their rewards promptly and on or before the projected date of October 15, 2017\n\nOf course, we recognize that unforeseen manufacturing problems can arise. If a manufacturing problem should occur, we are confident in our abilities to work through these issues to get rewards out to all of our backers by the specified date. In the highly unlikely event that we are not able to deliver the game for some unforeseeable, unfathomable reason, we will refund all pledges.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Virtual High-Five", "descp": "Get updates on the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Hiker Support Team", "descp": "Sticker + Bandana", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "ME-GA EXPANSION Set - EARLY BIRD", "descp": "ME-GA Expansion Set + Sticker + Bandana\n*Includes both the Thru-Hiker and A.T.

Some real action: racing.\nYou know you can beat half of those twerps already. And if you can raise some quick cash and buy a better rod, you can beat the rest. You know with the right car you can beat the king. Then you\u2019ll have some cash and Becky Sue!\nThis is how the famous retro video game begins. Now we offer you the same experience, off-line and together with friends: Street Rod \u2013 the Card Game.     \nGameplay in action\n                 Basic set Tuck Box\n  Deluxe set Telescope Box with sturdy inlay\n  Street Rod - the card game is for 1-5 players and takes 20-30 minutes. The game is played over several rounds. In each round you buy car parts in the garage to customize your rod and, if you like, race an opponent or one of the other players. If you\u2019re good, you win some bucks. If you\u2019re better, you can win the other guy\u2019s rod. If you\u2019re the best, you can beat the king!  \nStep 1: At the beginning of the game, you split the deck and search yours for cars and parts worth $500. You find a nice chevrolet ($300), some tires ($100) and for the remaining $100 you pick a carburator.\nStep 2: You draw 5 cards from the deck. This is the shop. Your budget is $200 and you choose... the engine. It's a General Motors, so it fits your chevrolet! You add it to your hand.   \nStep 3: You have to choose whether you want to race, and with who. Patty? Nah, too easy. You want to race Tom in a drag race. His score on that track is 18.  \nStep 4: What's your score on the Drag Race Track? On the Drag Race, your total Power is doubled. So your end score will be: Power *2 + Acceleration + Skill = (2+2+0+1)*2 + (2+0+1+1) + 0 = 14. This means your score against Tom is 14-18 = -4.  \nStep 5: Pick the upper cards from the deck and check the BadLuck Indicator. If it's equal to or lower than your score against Tom, then you've won. The BadLuck Indicator is -7. Lucky you! You've won! Add Tom to your hand. Next time you race you will have an extra 6 skill points. You're almost ready to race the King...  \nThe concept rules are available for download on our BGG-page.\n     \nThe Basic set (MRSP: \u20ac13) contains the rules sheet, 54 cards (12 cars, 16 opponents and 26 parts), wrapped in a simple Tuck Box.\n   In the Deluxe version (MRSP \u20ac19), the tuck box is replaced for a twice as big 140x100x25mm Telescope Box.

You can see that in some of the other games we've published, like La Cosa Nostra, Carson City and Vanuatu.\nWith Halloween, there is a different kind of interaction, this game focuses on the movement of ghosts on the map. These ghost belong to everyone, so the confrontation is on another level. It's possible to advance quickly in this game and take out the weaker ghosts, so other players are finding it hard to accomplish the same level. \nThe most beautiful thing about this project is that Angelo made a game that is very variable and quite unique.

A vast network of mossy underground tunnels and connected forest areas await your adventurers! \nForest of Shadows is a stand alone expansion that you can play on its own or in combination with the original. \nOne Deck Dungeon: Forest of Shadows is a 1-2 player roguelike adventure card game (just like the original One Deck Dungeon!) It's a standalone expansion, so it can be played as its own full game, or mixed with the original. If you're new to One Deck Dungeon, see the Basics section below for an introduction to gameplay.\nThe game includes 44 Encounter cards, 5 Dungeon/Boss cards, 4 Level cards, a Stairs card, 5 postcard-sized Hero Cards, a Turn Reference, a set of campaign sheets, 15 hearts for damage tokens, 6 potion cubes, 8 poison cubes, and 30 shiny translucent dice. The 3D shot above doesn't show them as translucent, but that's merely a failing of my amazing 3D skills. Basically, the expansion has the same types of components as the base game. Since it's a stand-alone expansion, that makes sense!\nForest of Shadows comes with both a full v1.5 rulebook and a small rules supplement for its new mechanics. \nThe core gameplay elements are the same as the original One Deck Dungeon; you'll still be busting through doors ready to beat up baddies and avoid dangerous perils. There are some new twists, and of course all-new cards!\nYou can download a full Print and Play version of the base game and Forest of Shadows, along with the rules PDFs for each.  \nPrint and Play: [ Base | Forest ] Rules: [ Base | Forest ] \nv1.5 Upgrade Pack\nSince the original game's printing, we updated some of the terminology and made a few balance tweaks. A full list of these can be found in our [v1.5 Patch Notes] \nSeveral tiers offer a v1.5 upgrade pack, which is a full deck of 56 cards and 6 hero cards + turn reference with all the updates. You can add-on upgrade packs to any tier by adding to your pledge according to the chart at the bottom of the KS page. A full copy of the v1.5 rulebook is included with each copy of Forest of Shadows.\nPlastic Cards vs Normal Cards\nPlastic cards are waterproof, durable, and still very smooth to shuffle. Most people say that they feel like normal cards! You should never need to sleeve plastic cards, but avoid getting acidic foods or drinks on them. That can damage the coating. Both types of cards fit safely in the box (normal cards fit with sleeves, unless they are very thick sleeves)\nAdd-ons / Shipping Costs\nAt the end of the page there is a list of add-ons available and shipping costs. Simply increase your pledge by each add-on you want, and you're good to go! No additional shipping costs required. If you're in the EU (including the UK) we cover VAT and customs fees for you.\nWe'll have a post-campaign pledge management website to let you specify what your add-ons are, and increase your pledge if you decide you want additional items!\nOne Deck Dungeon is fully co-operative. Each turn in the game is shared by the entire party. Every turn, time will pass, and then the party will decide to either Explore or Enter a Room. Exploring will add more face-down cards to the dungeon as closed doors. Entering a room flips over one of these doors to reveal an encounter: either a combat you must face, or a peril to overcome.\nCombat encounters pit you against the monsters and denizens of the dungeon. Each card has a variety of challenge boxes, representing the amount of damage and spent time you might incur while fighting.\nIn a combat, you'll roll one die for each of the attribute icons on your hero card (plus any items you've picked up). You can place a die in any box matching its color, as long as the die's value is at least as high as the number in the box. \nAny boxes you don't fill with dice represent the consequences of vanquishing your foe: the amount of damage the party incurred and how long it took to win. Damage tokens are placed on your hero card, but be careful -- if the number of tokens is equal to your health, the game is over. As long as you survive, though, you always win the battle and claim loot. You're heroes, after all!\nPeril encounters pit you against all sorts of obstacles you may encounter on your adventure. Each peril has two options to choose from for how to best overcome it. \nAgainst a peril, you'll roll only your dice of the color that matches the choice you picked, trying to fill the box on the peril card for the option the party chose. Wide boxes like those on peril cards can be filled by any number of dice added together. Don't worry! You don't have to roll an 11 on one six-sided die.\nEven if the party takes damage and spends time, you still claw your way to the loot behind the peril... as long as the fall from that rope bridge wasn't too bad.\nEvery encounter you survive brings you loot! Each card in the dungeon deck can be used as loot in one of three ways. You always get the card as loot, even if you took damage or spent time during the Suffer Consequences step for not filling some of the challenge boxes in the encounter. \nItems and Skills are tucked underneath your Hero card. Items will increase your dice pool and possibly your maximum health. Skills are used during encounters to modify your dice or roll additional ones to help you overcome the situation at hand.\nExperience is tucked underneath the Level card. Your current level determines the maximum number of Items and Skills your hero can possess. Each time you level up, you'll also get a free potion. At the start of the game, you only have access to Healing potions, but you may find other types as you delve deeper...\nEach of the five dungeons has its own unique set of effects and challenge boxes. As you delve deeper into the dungeon, more and more of these boxes will be revealed. They add difficulty to every encounter in the game, and mean that an adventure in the Vile Roots feels very different from the Realm of Venom.  \nOnce you go through each section of the dungeon, the boss awaits at the end, on the back of the dungeon card. The boss battle is a multi-round combat encounter. If the party can vanquish this final foe, you'll have emerged victorious!\n  Poison is a new type of consequence that appears in challenge boxes. 8 green poison cubes are included with the game, and they get placed on heroes just like normal damage. Poison is dangerous for two reasons:\n1) If you ever need to add a poison token and none are available, the heroes lose.\n2) Every time the party explores, and before each round of boss combat, roll one die to resist poison. If the roll is higher than the number of poison tokens in the entire party, remove one poison token. Otherwise, remove one poison token and replace it with two damage tokens.\nLuckily, there are herbs in the forest! Half of the cards in the expansion have a leaf icon on them. For each open door with a leaf showing when the party explores, add 1 to the resist poison die roll.\nRemoval: Several boss and dungeon effects remove dice or poison tokens from play. These are not returned to the supply, they're placed in the box for the remainder of the game! \nSince running out of poison tokens ends the game, this is quite dangerous. Having less dice available is no picnic either, as you'll start running out when you try to use skills during encounters.\nPet Panther / Peril Options: Do you want a pet Panther? I bet you do! Several of the perils in Forest of Shadows have the loot they provide determined by which option the party chooses. In the case of the panther, you can try and sneak by it to claim an item, or charm it to keep it by your side for the rest of the adventure. Nobody's fighting that panther. It's big!\nCombining Sets: Forest of Shadows is a standalone expansion, which means you do not need the original game to play. You can mix and match heroes and dungeons from the two sets. The Hunter could visit the Dragon's Cave, and the Rogue could journey into the Realm of Venom. You can also create a dungeon deck of the two sets mixed together, taking 22 cards from the original One Deck Dungeon and 22 from Forest of Shadows. See the rulebook for more details! \n              We're doing something fun for this campaign: instead of small stretch goals for things we really wanted to put in the game no matter what, we're focusing on big exciting stretch goals! \nIt's still fun to reveal and unlock things as the campaign goes along though, so we revealed a number of bonus items over the course of teh campaign!\n5th Hero: The Alchemist was added. She gets a second use out of every potion!\n5th Dungeon: The Lair of Indrax was added, the hardest of the 5 Forest of Shadows dungeons!\nCampaign Sheets: New Campaign Sheets, with 3 new focus groups were added.\n6th Dungeon + Hero: Caliana and the Phoenix's Den will be in every copy of Forest of Shadows. Previously, they were available only as a PDF download.\nHordes of the Shadows: A special card to increase difficulty for 4 player games was added. Since the Phoenix's Den increased the deck size to 60 for the expansion, we added this card, along with Basic Potions and Poison Reference cards.\nThe big stretch goals below are all for items that don't go in the game box, because they are either digital in nature or simply too large and awesome. The goals are high, but that's what stretch goals should be - things we wouldn't be able to do without your support:\nOur first stretch goal is for a story mode to accompany the campaign sheets included with the game, and also a full soundtrack with a song for each of the five dungeons. The story will feature a choose-your-own-adventure style plot between games, linking together the 10 available dungeons into one larger campaign. It will be available as a PDF or on our website, OneDeckDungeon.com.  \nWe've already made one track, it's the one used in the video. Here's the full version:\nThe playmat has been unlocked early, and is available as a $20 add-on to your pledge. See the add-ons section below for details!\nShipping rates for this campaign are very simple. You pay one rate based on your region, regardless of the number of games you want to add on.\nUPDATE: We have reached a deal to prepay your customs and VAT if you're in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. In addition, we've been able to reduce shipping from $20 to $15 for UK backers. There's a special pledge level for UK backers, the $20 UK Shipping Zone level.\nKickstarter backer orders will be sent out first, before any copies bound for conventions, retail, or distribution. You're our backers! You deserve to be the first to delve into the Forest of Shadows. Sorry about all the poison and monsters~\nIn keeping with our simple shipping scheme, additional copies are very easy to add to your pledge. Simply add the amount below (after shipping), and note in the Kickstarter survey which thing you've backed for when the campaign concludes.  Add-ons of games and upgrade packs have no additional shipping cost. You can also add additional money through the pledge manager after the campaign.\n[$20: Glooping ooze plushie! It's here to steal your heart (tokens)]\nv1.5 Cards-only upgrade packs contain the 56 cards, 5 hero cards, and the Turn Reference necessary to play the game, and assume you have the rest of the components (dice, wooden bits, etc) from the original game. \nYou can read our \"patch notes\" describing what changed in v1.5. \nPlastic cards are more durable, waterproof, but still easy to shuffle and play with. After the first campaign, many people remarked that they couldn't possibly be plastic after feeling how nice the surface and shuffling was! \nJust, you know, don't put ketchup on them.

All shipping fees are standard, and based on the actual fee we will need to pay GamesQuest. The shipping fees will be added to your pledge level, and will be charged through Kickstarter. This will make sure you only need to provide your credit card information once. To reduce shipping costs for backers in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, we will take care of the shipping in these countries ourselves. For an overview of the prices see below. You can reduce shipping costs by making a group pledge! For more information give us a message.\nJust like with our previous Kickstarter it is possible to pick up your game at one of the many conventions we're attending, including Essen SPIEL 2017, Ducosim, Spel (Antwerp), Spellenspektakel, and at the BBA HQ and release party.\n    Black Box Adventures is an Indy tabletop games developer and publisher from the Netherlands. We strive to bring you games with our three core values in mind:\nQUALITY: what you get is a high quality product worth your time, as we want to bring you more than some cards and dice in a box. Yes, we are a business, and our business is to make you happy.\nORIGINAL: Zombies vs Cthulhu? Booooring!! We strive to think outside of the box and make tabletop games with unique twists and themes. Battling seafood on a plate of spaghetti...now we're talking.\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE: we only publish games that have our full support, but we\u2019re all just ordinary people. We like to work in the community so please let us know what you think!\nFrutti di Mare is the brainchild of Maarten de Schrijver. Maarten made the original game design \u00e1nd artwork. He was working on Frutti di Mare for 2 years before he contacted us. Maarten is a 2D and 3D designer, which you'll quickly recognize from the beautifully designed artwork. The original game and theme struck us immediately, and after more play testing and adjustments Frutti di Mare was ready to be brought on Kickstarter for your judgement. \nSaluti!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our first successfully funded and fulfilled project last year, Black Box Adventures is ready for more. Although every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. Because this won't be our first project, we have some record to give backers confidence.\n\nThe game, artwork and design are ready to be printed. We received quotes from multiple manufacturers, both domestic as well as foreign. To get the high quality we want, we've chosen one of the best production facilities available. In addition, this manufacturer is located in the vicinity, which makes it easy for us to check the production process if necessary. The manufacturer will print and assemble the games, however some parts are normally produced in China (dice). For these parts we've chosen to search for another producer in the EU instead, to prevent possible delays/problems that are associated with overseas freight shipping.\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. Because the game is produced in the EU, EU-backers won't need to worry about extra customs charges. In our previous project we handled the shipping ourselves in order to lower the shipping costs to our backers and to learn the ins and out of the shipping process, despite the enormous amount of work. Due to one failing shipping company some backers received their game a little bit later, however in the end we've managed to handle all problems. With Frutti di Mare we will use a highly renowned fulfillment partner to tackle both of these problems: GamesQuest. GamesQuest is a company located in the UK and has handled the fulfillment of numerous Kickstarter projects, including Scythe. Jamey Stegmaier highly recommends them.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer the game will be ready before Essen SPIEL 2017, however some events may be out of our or their reach. If for some unforeseen circumstances we won't be able to deliver the product at Essen SPIEL 2017, we will have to arrange a pickup at another convention or charge shipping costs if you've chosen for the pledge with pickup.\n\nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our assortment, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece drooling in flavor on its own. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous game, we will listen to the backers, so together we can make the best out of Frutti di Mare.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "GRAZIE!", "descp": "Antipasti for the small hunger:\nINCLUDES:\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nA sincere thank you!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["57 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "RETAILERS", "descp": "Please send us a message on Kickstarter or an email to: kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com to receive a price list.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "1x FRUTTI DI MARE (\u20ac35 MSRP)", "descp": "1 daily dish please:\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\nYour Name in the Cookbook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["112 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "1x FRUTTI DI MARE PICK-UP (\u20ac35 MSRP)", "descp": "1 daily dish to go please.\nPick up your game at Spiel Essen 2017, Spellenspektakel, Ducosim, Spel (Antwerpen), BBA HQ, release party.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\nYour Name in the Cookbook", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac65 or more", "title": "1x FRUTTI DI MARE CON AMORE", "descp": "Romantic dinner for two!\nShipping included\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\nYour Name in the Cookbook\nReal looking pearls upgrade (plastic)\n2\u00d7 Set of 3 Geekboxes\nRed-white checkered Tablecloth\nA Romantic Candle\nShipping Included!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac70 or more", "title": "COMBO DEAL FdM + RotD + Bob (\u20ac98 MSRP)", "descp": "One dish of the house please.\nNOTE: Revenge of the Dictators excluding the kickstarter only \"Fake Passports\"\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Frutti di Mare\nA Print-and-Play download of the game\nAll stretch goals achieved\nKickstarter Exclusive Frutti di Mare Cookbook\n1 copy of Revenge of the Dictators\n1 copy of The American Agent a.k.a.

The game is as good as it can possibly be right now!\nPlease take a look at the Whats in the Box? and Stretch Goals sections below for more details on all the amazing content in store for Kickstarter backers.\nThank you all for an unbelievably fun, positive and successful campaign!\nMaximum Apocalypse is a cooperative roguelike adventure game for 1-6 players. Civilization has already fallen. The players must survive the hostile landscape.   \nThe game map is randomly generated and different every time that you play. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to explore the map, play cards, equip weapons, scavenge for resources, draw cards or battle off monsters.  \nPicking a unique survivor class within the group, players must plan their strategy and work together while leaning on their survivor\u2019s strengths in order to defeat monsters and avoid starvation. For example, the Fireman is deadly up close with his ax and can easily chop down monsters; meanwhile the stealthy Hunter is great at scouting the map and avoiding traps \u2014 but roaming monsters are gathering quickly and time is running out. If players are overwhelmed by monsters or die of starvation, they lose. If they can find enough fuel and get it back to their van to escape, they all win and live to play another scenario.\nAs a survivor of the apocalypse, players will equip weapons, battle monsters, draw cards and scavenge the post-apocalyptic wasteland looking for useful supplies. \nCooperation is key in this deep game of survival.  \nIt's Different Every Time you Play\nMaximum Apocalypse comes with (at least) 3 totally different post-apocalyptic scenarios. When you mix these scenarios with different monsters, map tiles, scavenge items, missions and characters classes, you get a near infinite amount of combinations and maps with tons of replayability.\nZombie - Don't get overwhelmed by the Undead...luckily they're not too bright.\nNuclear - Be prepared to give away your gear to nasty raiders before facing poisonous mutant rats.\nAlien - Race against the clock as the aliens force you to discard your deck as they work to ensure the enslavement of humanity.\nRobot - Fight the never ending replication and efficiency of your robotic overlords.\nChoose your Survivor\nThe Fireman is sturdy, strong and acts as the tank of the group. With his axe in hand, he is a massive short range damage dealer.\nThe Hunter is stealthy and precise. She can scout the landscape for danger and is deadly with her bow and traps.\nThe Gunslinger can deal midrange damage with his trusty revolvers as long as he has ammunition. \nThe Surgeon supports the group by restoring health and boosting team performance with shots of adrenaline.\nThe Veteran and his Dog are a team unto themselves.  The Vet has plenty of old military gear and his dog has excellent instincts. He's trained to scout and attack if necessary.\nThe Mechanic is a support class that can upgrade weapons, build defensive turrets or even call in a drone strike to clear a path forward.\nThe Scientist (KS BONUS!) is a quick learner that can adapt to the situation and research new skills and weapons.\nThe Army Ranger (KS BONUS!) is a sniper that can remove monster tokens and help control the onslaught of monsters.\nExplore and Survive!\nEvery turn, Players take 4 actions to explore the randomized map, fight off monsters, play cards and scavenge for resources.\nWhen you move to a new tile, you reveal it and get free actions or potentially fall into a trap...\nThere are two types of cards you can play on your turn: Instants and Gear.\nInstants are one shot cards that you play for their effect and then are discarded. Gear is equipped and takes up inventory slots but stays in play giving you access to new abilities. You will need to equip weapons and other gear to help you survive and fight dangerous roaming monsters.\nAs you explore the map, you\u2019ll come across new locations. Some of them are good and some can be very bad.\nOnce your turn is over, your hunger increases and monsters attack so you'll want to work together as a team to optimize your actions.\nComplete your Objective and Escape\nAs part of setup, players will select a mission or scenario. Most missions require finding a particular location and collecting enough fuel to escape.\nFace Roaming Monsters\nFor example, an early mission is to rescue a Scientist who may be able to cure the Zombie outbreak.

We know that shipping (especially internationally) can be annoyingly expensive; believe us, we are just as annoyed as you are! We are continuing to work toward minimizing the cost of shipping as much as possible. We don't want to stick anyone with a large shipping bill long after the campaign is over, so we will be subsidizing shipping equally in all regions so that we can charge affordable flat rate shipping:\nUnited States + UK: $5 \nCanada + Australia: $10\nEuropean Union: $10 - $15 (Depending on Country & Reward)\nSwitzerland, Norway: $15\nEverywhere Else: $20  \nWe plan on using customs-friendly shipping and fulfillment companies in each region to keep shipping costs as low as possible so that you can back more games! As a result, you should not get hit with customs, brokerage, or import fees. \nShipping is annoyingly expensive. However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, there are workarounds. The shipping rates will remain fixed regardless of the number of games or add-ons that you purchase. If you have a bunch of friends who want to support this project, just make one group pledge for as many games as you\u2019d like.\nRetailers  \nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact Mike directly at mike@rockmanorgames.com during the campaign for pricing information or back at the Retailer Pledge Level and we will be in touch.\nRock Manor Games successfully funded Brass Empire at the end of 2015 through Kickstarter. It was released 8 months later and subsequently sold out in limited distribution. We had so much fun making that game that we've been working on a bunch of new projects over the past few years and hope to have a very busy 2017-2018. The reception we've received has been amazing and we are thrilled to continue our work in the game industry.\n    About the Team\nMike with his wife Rose and daughter Penelope - Photo by Little Nest\nMike Gnade is a 10 year game industry veteran based in Wilmington, Delaware where he lives with his family.  He is obsessed with games of all kinds and is the designer and producer behind Maximum Apocalypse. He has been deeply involved in the indie gaming scene creating his own games and founding sites like IndieGameMag.com and IndieGameStand.com before designing his own tabletop games. \n  Gustav Rangmar is a freelance illustrator and concept artist from Sweden.  He is the one responsible for all of your gorgeous artwork.  You can see more of his work here.\nMatt Cangialosi, our lead playtester and marketing guru, is a gaming fanatic based up in Boston, MA.  His early feedback was essential and assisted with additional game design and playtesting.\nMartin Lauzon is a freelance Canadian video producer/animator and did an amazing job putting together our Kickstarter video.  You can contact him at albrech1s@gmail.com.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are fortunate to have gone through the Kickstarter process before and delivered our games to our backers in about 8 months from our project's end date. We attribute a lot of this speed to getting all of the core artwork completed upfront and have done the same with this project. We pride ourselves on communicating with our backers and impressing them by meeting deadlines and delivering an excellent product. \n\nAs with turning any idea into a physical product, any number of problems can get in the way. While we can\u2019t control everything, we can control our communication to our backers. Delays may happen, dates may change, but we will always be transparent and keep our backers in the loop.\n\n\nPRODUCTION & SHIPPING\n\nWe plan on using the same manufacturers and fulfillment pipeline that we have used in the past to minimize complications and ensure a high quality product.\n\nRULES \n\nDraft rules are available now under the Gameplay section. Please provide any feedback on them so that we can finalize the text and the rulebook shortly after the campaign.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address and other information required to ship your product to you in a timely manner.

We are showing love for beloved classics, as well as some of the hottest new games out there! And as always, please tell us which other games you'd still like to see upgrade options for - we listen!\nAs with our last Kickstarter project, we are glad to be able to offer flat rate shipping to all backers. You can get everything you want without raising your shipping cost - no limit!\n                                    If you missed the Kickstarter project for Hardback (the game itself), you can pre-order it here!\n  All pledge levels can also be an add-on! That means that if you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level and add the amount of the additional set(s). It's that easy!\nPlease Note: If you want a limited quantity pledge level and other items, please make sure your main pledge level is the limited one. If by chance you want two different limited pledge levels, send us a message on Kickstarter, and we'll make sure you are covered.\n  We don't want anything to stand between you and some really fantastic game upgrades. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your pieces). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is typically inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\n  All orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally.\n  We do not have stretch goals for this project - at least not in the conventional sense. We are more interested in hearing your ideas for new upgrade kits, and moving forward with some of the suggestions, making some of them available in this project as new pledge levels (and add-ons to any pledge level, of course). So speak up in the comments section! And if you see a suggestion that you love, say so! You are as much of a part of the creative process as we are - which is one reason we love Kickstarter so much!\n  Chris and Cynthia Landon are the siblings that own and operate Meeple Source. Andrea is the fantastic artist behind all of these new Character Meeples, and the overwhelming majority of our Character Meeples and upgraded resource bits to date. Karen and Erika are an incredibly important part of our quality control, packaging, and shipping team.\nLocated in Orlando, FL, we are a small family business that takes great pride in superb product quality and excellent customer service!\n  We have already created an enormous number of cool game pieces and accessories, so feel free to browse some of that past work on MeepleSource.com.\nScythe Worker Meeples and Painted Tokens\n  Puerto Rico (boats, trading house, resources, and coins)\n  Colt Express (Character Meeples and Horses)\n  Food Chain Magnate\n  Pandemic Character Germs (plus Character Meeples and Research Centers, not pictured)\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for about six years now, and other painted components longer than that. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 8 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. As a result, in combination with the enormous number of custom product combinations that we allow in our Kickstarter projects, shipping takes a good deal of time. We do use a post-project management system (typically BackerKit) which helps keep everything orderly.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you may know that a couple of our projects experienced minor delays, and that we were always straight-forward with regard to that. A distinct possibility for delay lies in the painting of the pieces, particularly Character Meeples. Although every individual meeple is hand-sorted for quality control, by us personally, there are times that errors in screen printing require that we re-make the entire batch of pieces for that particular Character Meeple. If this occurs, it will take a minimum of 8-10 weeks to replace them, which could delay shipping. For example, if this were to occur only a month before shipping would otherwise commence, some pledges would deliver after the estimated delivery date. Although we believe that we have allotted plenty of time for situations such as this, it should be noted that project delays are still a possibility. \n\nYou may know that our last project delivered quite early, and although this could occur again, you should know that we believe our estimated delivery dates to be accurate.\n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality. Our past customers know that this is true, and our Kickstarter backers know that we offer a money-back guarantee on all pledges.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

It was an ambitious project, and we had great pressure to ensure that the game's quality would be met.\n\nWhile we can certainly be proud of the final's game quality (Panda did an amazing job), we did suffer some production delays. We wanted the game to be as good as it could be, and that led to some re-designing of the game, namely the ant miniatures, and especially their special rotating bases, which we had to scrap a few times over since they weren't working quite like we wanted them to.\n\nWhich is why we are re-using these bases in part for DiverCity -- because they work incredibly well with the theme of diving in this game, and also to alleviate risks since we know they work now, and that they work very well. We are working again with Panda to deliver a quality product, as we did with BrilliAnts!\n\nThe hard part of a Kickstarter is often the fulfillment, which is why we're going to work with the same fulfillment centers and freight companies we have worked with in the past. We were first timers last time, which led to some confusion in setting up some accounts and payment, but it won't happen this time around! We are now very familiar with the process of worldwide fulfillment, so we will be well prepared to tackle on that challenge from day one and lead the games to your doorsteps.\n\nAs always, we remain open to any suggestions or help on that matter!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Maxime Tardif\n4 created \u00b7 57 backed\nHi, I'm Max from Sphere Games!

The mining industry created toxic wastes, combined to pollution they proved fatal to agriculture. Soon, the first mutated crops unleashed havoc. Water was no longer enough for them, they wanted a protein-rich, juicy steak dinner. We tried to give them our politicians instead of steak, but they just wouldn't eat them\u2026 it made them sick.\nThough we were tough, not to be frightened by zombie potatoes. We learned to tame our mutated vegetables. The farming profession went from a peaceful activity to a very risky albeit lucrative profession. Those who can sow, water and feed the best crops will become rich. \nIt's your turn to go to the fields. The Mutant Crops are waiting... will you dare to harvest them? \nIn Mutant Crops you're playing as a farmer who is seeking riches farming some of the most ravenous and dangerous crops the world has ever seen. Mutated from decades of pollution, these aren't your everyday vegetables. \nIn this short, simple and fun worker placement game you'll be placing your meeples on spaces in order to perform their actions such as gaining resources, purchasing crops, watering your plants, feeding them the steaks they're craving and competing with other farmers for another space on the board. \n\nYou're collecting resources: seeds, water and steak dinners. Seeds are necessary to purchase plants, and water/meat are necessary to nourish your crops to provide the best return. Crops are not worth anything until they've been watered and/or fed.\n\nThe farmer who has the most money at the end of the game can laugh their way to the bank - and the victory circle. \n\nThe game is the ideal filler for worker placement fans who want to have a quick game that still challenge their skills. It's a great introductory game for new players on euro-style games, and plays perfect with kids.\n\nNOTE: PNP Demo and Rulebook aren't final. Both will be improved based on your feedback (Rules) and on stretch goals (Deluxe PNP).\n   Note: All previews where made with the prototype box. Final box will be different, and game components quality will be highly improved.\n  We'll be working with GamesQuest for fulfillment outside of the US, which will allow us to be EU-friendly. Since the game is under $20, it will also be US, Australia and Canadian-friendly. \nTo keep the cost of the game down we're going to send untracked packages, though we'll look into having an add-on in our pledge manager to add tracking after the campaign. \nWe love and support FLGS! We're very proud to be able to work with local gaming stores and are glad to have gaming stores working with us to deliver our games to more customers. \n\nIf you operate a retail store and would like to support our project please email info@atherisgames.com for pricing and shipping information. \n\nSebas & Rocio\nMutant Crops was designed by Sebastian Koziner and illustrated by Rocio Og\u00f1enovich. We're a married couple consisting of a board game artist (Rocio) and a graphic designer/game design (Sebas). For the last several years we've worked together running OK Art Studio, which has been involved in the art/graphic design of over 10 successful games with clients such as Dr Finn and Pencil First Games. \nWe publish our games and comics in Argentina with our publishing studio, OK Ediciones - a pioneer in modern games in our country. Mutant Crops will be our second game published worldwide, our first was called Oni. Oni was published through Kickstarter in 2015 by Treesharp Games. We're really excited to bring Mutant Crops to Kickstarter! \nAtheris Games\nAtheris Games is a board game publishing company based out of Orlando, FL. Atheris Games launched Cul-De-Sac Conquest on Kickstarter and were 're proud to bring Mutant Crops to Kickstarter! \nSebastian worked with Atheris for the graphic design of Cul-De-Sac Conquest and our up-and-coming game Supernatural Socks - when he said he had a game he would like us to publish we of course had to take a look. Though we definitely agreed to look at it because he was so great to work with, we were instantly super impressed with this little worker placement game. Mutant Crops is a great game, and one Atheris is proud to publish. \nWe hope you will enjoy it as much as we do! \nMutant Crops was originally co-published in Argentina by OK Ediciones and El Drag\u00f3n Azul.

We also took out some of the campaign pledge levels that added time for Cul-De-Sac. \n\nThough we're sure we will encounter some mistakes again we feel that we have learned a great deal to prevent them. Also, we have added a more solid buffer in our shipping time to account for any potential problems. \n\nFurthermore, our transparency with our backers and our communication is of supreme importance to us. For Cul-De-Sac Conquest we delivered thank you cards and stickers to all of our backers who answered our backer survey and continually update the campaign so backers knew everything that they needed to about the progress of the game. \n\nDespite being late on Cul-De-Sac backers were still constantly reminded that that we were working and doing everything in our power to deliver the best game possible.

Once you have all five animal cards and your lineage marker, you can move your student and master to the center octagon. The first player to do so has successfully passed on their martial arts lineage, and wins the game!\nMeanwhile, one player represents the emperor, working to unify the empire by placing towers in the four corners of the board. As the empire expands, the emperor\u2019s forces grow. Recruited generals give the emperor greater power and flexibility but the additional forces require vigilance and careful planning. Generals rely on the emperor or empress to create paths for them across unforgiving terrains. If the emperor places towers in the four corners before one of the other players has passed on their martial arts lineage, the emperor player wins, and only the emperor\u2019s lineage will prevail.\n    Wu Wei: Journey of the Changing Path is played in a series of rounds. In each round, players take turns in clockwise order, beginning with the starting player. As the seasons change, a gathering will be triggered every winter, during which turn order is reassigned. The game continues in this way until one player wins.\n                      SOLO CAMPAIGN ADDED  \nNot only is there going to be a solo campaign but I have enlisted the help of Mike Mullins (a solo gaming enthusiast and experienced developer) to help me put the final touches on the solo version of the game.

If you\u2019re a fan of abstract strategy or if you want to see a martial arts game that isn\u2019t about flying kicks and throwing punches but digs deeper into the philosophy, Wu Wei is certainly worth checking out.

This image links to the working document.\n               THE GAME \nPlayers have a team of food trucks matching each venue. Each round, players secretly select and reveal two venues to sell their grub.\n  Players select actions to play this round, and then play them clockwise one at a time hoping to better their chances at a fat payout.\n  At the end of a round, the customers are split evenly between # of trucks. Any remainder is discarded. Food trucks return to players and actions are discarded from the game.\nTWO PLAYER VARIANT\n WHY KICKSTARTER?\nIf we reach our goal, we will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of Truck Off: The Food Truck Frenzy. Manufacturing is lined up. Artwork files will be shipping to the printer shortly after the project. All that is left is the funding.  \nWe're still small, and we love Kickstarter because it puts us directly in contact with incredible people willing to help build something they believe in. We're engaged with the community attending events and meetups around the midwest including Gen Con four years in a row.  We feel energized by these connections and building trust within the community. We reward our supporters with discounts on the game and free flowing communication with us the creators. As a backer, you'll be a copilot and chef on this journey to create awesome games.\nPAST PROJECTS\nIn February 2015, we raised $36,078 on Kickstarter with our first game, Brewin' USA. This game takes place at the inception of the craft beer revolution. Players auction over brewing ingredients, brew their signature line of craft beers, and compete for city and regional area control! The game has continued to grow including selling out of inventory at GenCon 2016. This project was a wonderful ride and we owe a huge thanks to our backers.  \nBrewin' USA (Kickstarter)\nBrewin' USA website\nBrewin' USA (Amazon)\nMEET THE DESIGNER\nFrom Ryan Lambert - I started gaming when I was little, especially with my Dad. We played the standards like Monopoly, Risk, Pay Day, and Careers. Eventually, we discovered games like Catan and Agricola and the collection has gotten out of hand since then. My favorite game right now is Pandemic Legacy. It\u2019s cliche, but the experience is just too good. A close second would be Imperial Assault or Blood Rage. \nI started designing games a couple years ago because I love to create and explore themes and mechanics. Truck Off started with theme. Food trucks are abundant in the Twin Cities and the idea of owning one has always appealed to me. After so many iterations, I love how clean the design of Truck Off ended up with a good mix of strategy and luck. It\u2019s a great casual game that scales well for groups and I hope you have as much fun with it as I have.\nMEET THE PROJECT CREATOR\nStill a small outfit, Adam and Chris from Adam's Apple Games are eager to continue to grow in the gaming industry.  We're engaged in this community, and will continue to deliver awesome projects and give our commitment and energy back in return. We write our final rules in as a female lead player. Check us out from Gen Con 2016, and we're pumped to announce we'll be back at Gen Con 2017! \nMEET THE ARTIST\nJohn Ed de Vera on Instagram\nJohn specializes in a unique paper craft artwork style.  This means literally cutting paper and then photographing his work.  This is a super unique style that captures depth and shadows making his pieces look unbelievably real.  He is a master at his craft, hands down.\nMore artwork on the way soon!\n SHOW YOUR SUPPORT AVATARS\nPlace these in your profile picture on Kickstarter or as your profile pic on social media to showcase your support!  \n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing.\" This is one of those things, but making new things is also tough!

You'll know if anything unexpected happens and do my best to make it right. I strive to deliver on time against project deadlines and to avoid unexpected shipping delays.

It sees a group of each characters wake up from the exact same terrible dream, only to discover it's coming to life in the real world.\nEach time the game is played, a Shared Dream scenario is chosen, with each one providing a different set of objectives, enemy mechanics, and unique Nemesis. Every Shared Dream also contains its own set of Personal Reflections, mini-stories each character must progress through in order to contribute to winning the scenario.\nWith 4 Shared Dream scenarios to choose from, 6 unique player characters, and a modular city that changes with every playthrough, The Shared Dream combines the strategy and replayability of a board game with the mood, theme, and storyline of a RPG.\n    Download the Rules Here!  \nCombining the storytelling of an RPG with the strategy of a board game, The Shared Dream contains 2 main mechanics that push the game forward.  \nFirst is the Personal Reflection deck. At the beginning of each game, every player randomly chooses a Personal Reflection deck that is tied to the specific Shared Dream scenario they have chosen to play. This Personal Reflection deck tells the story of that individual's part of the Shared Dream, and their efforts to combat it in the Waking World. Each Personal Reflection deck sees players travel throughout the city, speak with its denizens, and face challenges and obstacles as they work towards completing their part of The Shared Dream.\nThe reflections of your dreams are the key to ending this nightmare.\nThe second is personal resource management. Every player can only take 3 actions per turn, so they must carefully consider how they are going to best spend their time. Do they rush through their Personal Reflection, helping to reach the final conflict as soon as possible? Do they carefully manage their resources to help slow the tide of enemies? Or do they go all out and defeat everything they can, despite the risks?\nIn addition to their actions, the main resource players use is Conviction. Conviction is used to channel their dream identities, helping them grow temporarily stronger, gain access to special powers, and defeat their enemies. Unfortunately, every time Conviction is spent, a character's Nightmare track is increased. At the end of every turn, players must roll a Nightmare check that grows harder the more Nightmare they have.  \nOnce this Nightmare check is failed, that player spawns a new enemy whose strength is dictated by the amount of Nightmare the player has. In this way, players must always consider when and how to use their Conviction. While spending 3 Conviction to channel at full power may be helpful now, it will inevitably have consequences down the line.\nTo see more of The Shared Dream in action, check out these videos! \n                       *Please note that the Alternate Animus promo cards do not add an additional scenario to the Crux Collection.\n                      To include an add-on, after you pledge, click on the blue \"manage my pledge\" button. On the next page, you will see your current pledge total. Add the amount of the add-on you want to the current amount, and hit \"confirm\". Once the campaign has completed, we will gather more information as necessary.\nThis full set of Conviction and Nightmare themed custom dice comes with 4 blue Over dice and 4 red Under dice. Just add $5 to your pledge.\nAll returning backers receive a free set of custom dice!  \nThe Crux Collection adds 6 unique solo scenarios, each of which will help immerse you in the lore of The Shared Dream. \nThe Crux Collection will grow along with the rest of this project! Any additional characters unlocked through Stretch Goals will also add a playable solo story to The Crux Collection.\nWhen a vicious Blood Drinker savagely hunts throughout the city, only the curse of the Moon Beast can stop it! Every night phase, players gain a chance to become the vicious Moon Beast, the only force strong enough to directly confront the Blood Drinker.\nThe Blood Drinker and Moon Beast can also be used as new characters to play any Shared Dream Scenario.\nDarker still is the inclusion of a new Reaver type, the Malefic. Created by an abundance of Shadows, the Malefic floods the city with enemies, requiring everyone to handle the new threat.\nThe Malefic can be used to greatly increase the challenge of any Shared Dream scenario.\nThe Shared Dream's take on the zombie genre! When there's no more room in your head, the dead will walk the earth! Featuring a brand new Nemesis, the Necromancer, Necrophobia sees players deal with an onslaught of undead enemies guided by a dark sorcerer's hand.\nIf you are adding Necrophobia to the Ultimate Edition, Dreaming in Bulk, or a discounted Ultimate Edition (if you are a returning backer), please adjust your pledge by $20 ($100 for Dreaming in Bulk) to receive Necrophobia! \nThe Horned Horror of Laruna lays waste to the Waking World in the Wrath of Axitath! This add-on introduces the new \"Wrath of Axitath\" scenario to The Shared Dream and includes the 85mm tall Axitath miniature!\nSave some cash when you back The Shared Dream and its 3 initial addons! Just choose \"The Ultimate Collection\" as your pledge level. The Ultimate Collection does NOT include the Of Dreams and Magic RPG, the Necrophobia expansion, or the Axitath expansion.\nGo All-In on The Shared Dream! This backer level gets you The Shared Dream, all stretch goals, and all of its expansions!\nWhether you're a RPG vet adding to their collection, or a first-time RPG player, take your game beyond the board with a copy of Of Dreams And Magic.\n  Shipping will be handled AFTER the Kickstarter is complete. Since we have multiple add-ons and stretch goals, we cannot fairly offer a single shipping cost to every backer.\nTo help minimize shipping costs, we will be subsidizing $15 worth of shipping on every package, regardless of size.\nWe will also be shipping from multiple fulfillment centers around the globe to help reduce costs and manage shipping in the most streamlined way possible.\nWe will be handling post-campaign management through Backerkit, and fulfillment through FulfillRite in the US and Canada, and Happyshops in Europe. We also enjoy an existing fulfillment relationship with Amazon, giving us even further options to ensure we can provide an optimum fulfillment solution for every backer.\nBelow is our ESTIMATE of shipping costs for the base game. Our current estimates do not show a shipping cost difference between the base game and the Ultimate Edition.  These costs may change based on stretch goals unlocked and additional add-ons purchased.\nPlease note that you can save on shipping by selecting the Dreaming in Bulk pledge level! When backing at the Dreaming in Bulk level, all 6 copies will be shipped to one location with shipping paid only once!\nIf you are a retailer interested in carrying The Shared Dream, please send us a message on Kickstarter or email john@odampublishing.com for pricing and other information.\nPlease refer to the latest update on the original campaign (found here!) for more information before you back!\n  The Shared Dream will be manufactured by WinGo Games\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe originally launched a Kickstarter for The Shared Dream in November of 2016. Soon after we launched, we received revised manufacturing quotes which opened up a lot of possibilities for us.\n\nWe believe this relaunch presents less risk than our initial campaign because we have been able to listen to a lot of backer feedback on ways to advance the campaign and make The Shared Dream better.\n\nThis feedback has lead to new add-ons, a lower goal, a lower base price, and more video content. \n\nFinally, we've been very conservative with our delivery goal. Our true hope is to have The Shared Dream ready to ship by August, but we're well aware that there are many factors at play when it comes to fulfilling board games, and some of those factors are out of our control.

I was Inspired by Eurostyle games in the late 90s and became a fan of legends like Reiner Knizia, Klaus Teuber, Martin Wallace and Andreas Seyfarth. I unveiled my prototype of Feudum at GenCon 2014 and was thrilled to meet and gain insight from folks like Eric Lang, Mike Eliott, Bruno Faidutti and Jamey Stegmaier. I am excited that the game has been hailed as \"articulate and inventive,\" and appears on several \"watch\" lists within the BoardGameGeek community. I sincerely hope the kickstarter community feels the same way. Check out facebook.com/feudum or BoardGameGeek to learn more.\nArtist\nAs he likes to put it, Justin Schultz is an \"earthling living in Jackson, Mississippi.\" Justin studied graphic design at Mississippi State University and worked for a number of advertising agencies before focusing on concert posters, album covers, package design and, just recently, board game art! His distinctive style of populating his art with monsters, reptiles and robots conjures up memories of children's picture books, albeit slightly skewed. Justin explains that he likes to lure viewers in with \"superficially charming images,\" but then reveal something more \"heartbreaking\" or \"daunting\" upon closer inspection.  In 2010, Justin started his independent studio, The Flying Chair\nOdd Bird Games is excited to announce a partnership with Quartermaster Logistics to get you your rewards!

These rates are based on current carrier rates (FedEx, UPS) and may fluctuate.  \n\nRest of the World Fulfillment\nQM logistics is dedicated to finding the most cost-effective delivery solution for backers around the world, therefore, the \u201cRest of World\u201d rate is merely an averaged estimate. When possible, QM Logistics will use the fulfillment centers that are closest to backers in order to save them money. (For example, fulfilling from China, for East Asia, or fulfilling others from the EU shipping.) Be forewarned, it may be difficult to economically ship to some places in the world, but we will do our best.  \n\nBulk Shipping\nHeavier rates will generally just be a multiple or combination of 50lb and under rates. So, shipping 5 Feudum Cartons  (3 games per carton) at 46.5 kgs, would probably travel in 1 30kg and 1 20kg package in Europe, or possibly travel in 5 separate 10 kg packages. It would depend on how the packing works out. Often these shipments will be broken up in multiple boxes that are all shipped at once.\n\nPallet Shipping\nOnce we reach a pallet sized shipment, (i.e. 99+ games), costs almost entirely depend on where it will be shipped. For example, shipping a single pallet can range from $150 - $700 in the U.S. \nFollow Feudum on social media! Oh, and tell your friends!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTruth be told, there will undoubtedly be a smattering of bumps, hiccups and faux pas made on this maiden voyage of ours. It is, after all, the first game that Justin and I have created. Deftly navigating the rough waters of fulfillment houses, freight shippers, manufacturers and backer relations won't be easy. \n\nOur naivet\u00e9 is bound to try someone's patience at some point in this adventure. That said, my artist and I are indubitably marked by an old-fashioned, yet noble code of conduct: We always try to do the right thing. \n\nOf course, to do the right thing, one must have knowledge. Thanks to a treasure trove of books, online resources and the generous support of the game designer community, we both feel quite prepared to take on this challenge. \n\nAdditionally, we have invested time and money in key partnerships that will streamline all operations. Backerkit will facilitate backer orders; OTX will ensure that freight shipping goes off without a hitch; Fulfillment houses like Fulfillrite, Spiral Galaxy, Starlit, Aetherworks and SFC will allow games to ship from within backers' countries of origin. \n\nSo far, these partnerships have been marked by transparency and free-flowing communication, right down to the way cardboard boxes and bubble wrap will be used to ensure the safe transport of every game. \n\nAt first, Odd Bird Games was like a methane gas-sniffing canary trapped deep within the bowels of a coal mine.

It's originality has been recognized by the world record holder dice collector Mr. Kevin Cook, and the project is going to be featured in the art photo book \"Dice \u2013 Rendezvous with Randomness\" by M\u00e5ns Danneman (to be soon published by \u00c5skf\u00e5geln).\nThey are still in demand, but not many are left. This campaign will provide good company to your First Edition Ptolemaic Constellation Dice (Northern Sky), while offering new backers the chance to grab the very last available First Edition, along with all new designs.\nThis campaign has been in the making for one year... \n ...Have you got space in your collection? \nPlease note: The rewards launched when the campaign started do not include the dice unlocked with Stretch Goals. Suggested rewards for new backers are:\n\u20ac9 Sample Dice Colors (4 dice, 3 options)\n\u20ac18 Cartographer's Bundle (8 dice, 2 options)\n\u20ac24 Astronomer's Polyhedral set (9 dice)\n\u20ac35 Collector's Night Black Polyhedral set (12 dice)\n\u20ac65 Master's SUPERSAVER Bundle (30 dice)\n\u20ac24 Astronomer's Polyhedral set\nTo get one of all available dice versions (design / color / finishing) select the \u20ac22 One Deluxe Anniversary Set and increase your pledge by \u20ac30 to upgrade it with polyhedrals and the Northern Sky dice in light blue color.\nMost rewards over \u20ac22 are sent with tracked shipping, but that does not reach all destinations (e.g. Australia, Norway...). If your nation is missing in the list, and you are ok with untracked shipping, please contact me because it may be possible to ship that way.\nAll dice will be precision engraved (not silkscreened) for maximum durability.\nNow available... the full polyhedral set:\nThe sets will be made in a limited edition of only 500 sets per color, unless sufficient funding allows for a larger manufacturing quantity.\n\u20ac24 Astronomer's Polyhedral set\n  Celebrating 450 Years of Discovery and Exploration\n2017 will mark the 40th anniversary of the Voyager spacecrafts, that allowed us to admire Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and now are travelling out of the solar system.  \nIt is interesting to point out that \"Voyager\" actually means a traveller to a distant land (especially one who travels by sea) as 2017 will also be the uncelebrated 450th anniversary of the European exploration of the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn 1567 \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a de Neira reached the Solomon Islands, and very soon afterwards a new set of constellations was created to help navigators, and honor new instruments of science such as the pendulum clock and the telescope. \nThe first new dice will be 16mm d6 like the one before, showing the constellations of the Southern Hemisphere (including the Southern Cross), and the Magellanic Clouds. A glow-in-the-dark option of Constellation Dice is available.\nRendering of Southern Sky Constellation Dice\nDue to incredibly high demand and overwhelming positive feedback, and since a new color has been added to the available options, also the original limited edition Ptolemaic Constellation (Northern Sky) Dice will be reprinted IN THE NEW COLOR ONLY.\nRendering of Northern Sky Constellation Dice (new color)\nIf you choose Morning Sky color for your Constellation Dice, half will be Southern Sky, while the other half will be Northern Sky.\nIf you want a mixed set, to add more dice to your reward select one option from the list available in the FAQ at the bottom of this page:\n\"What are the available options to get Extra Dice?\".\nI have added a convenient \u20ac6 one to obtain both Constellation Dice finishing (standard and glow-in-the-dark).\nOptional glow-in-the-dark finish for all versions.\nIn the following years, as a result of improvements Galileo Galilei made to the telescope, with a magnifying capability of 20\u00d7, he was able to see celestial bodies more distinctly than was ever possible before. This allowed Galilei to discover in either December 1609 or January 1610 what came to be known as the Galilean moons. \nThe second new dice will be a couple of d10 featuring the planets, and all their 9 moons discovered before 1700 only by using optical means.\nThese dice do not glow in the dark. Prototypes should be ready soon. Update: if you get a total of at least four Solar System Voyager d10 (in your chosen reward, or by pledging extra), one couple will glow-in-the-dark. This doesn't apply for retailers bundles.\nRendering of Voyager Dice (planets d100, moons d10)\nAt zero sides you'll see the sun and our moon. Pluto is still included as the ninth planet, although it is now classified as a dwarf planet (one in a growing series). \nThe third new dice will be a 16mm d6 with little stars that can be used as pips counting from 1 to 6, while the big sparkling stars, spanning two sides each, make the dice compatibile with Fudge/FATE, for those who play by that ruleset (please check update #6 to learn more about Fudge).\nThese dice do not glow in the dark. Prototypes should be ready soon.\nAlthough they feature no recognizable constellations, these dice can be used as a background starfield to Constellation Dice, while allowing to reproduce your favourite asterism... as sung in the first inspiration of this project, Bj\u00f6rk's song \"Desired Constellation\":\nThe manufacturing of the dice will start in January 2017 as soon as the funds and the surveys are collected. According to the factory schedule, about three months would be needed for completing the order, which is much more complex than the initial plan of making only a couple of dice types in two colors. The sorting and packaging of the dice should take two weeks, and shipment about three weeks, allowing for delivery a couple months before the Voyagers' anniversary in August 2017.\nChart of the Reward Tiers\nKickstarter doesn't allow multiple pledges and I had to publish several different reward tiers trying to make everyone happy. The main offering including all the new dice is the Anniversary Set, to which the Collector's Bundles add the original first edition Constellation Dice in Night Black and Sky Blue color. The Deluxe versions include also glow-in-the-dark dice, along with the Scout's Bundles, the Master's SUPERSAVER Bundle and the Cartographer's Bundle which offer a partial, inexpensive selection of the available dice. If you value quantity, get the Five Friends SUPERSAVER Bundle, a good deal for retailers.\nThe following chart displays the content of the main sets. \nIt is also available for download in printable PDF format.\nThe costs do not include shipping because it may vary. If you need further help to pick the best one for you, scroll down to the FAQ: \"How do I choose the right bundle?\" at the bottom of this page, or just ask. I'm here to help.\nPlease CLICK to enlarge.\n  Extending your reward tier with dice unlocked by Stretch Goals\nThe Extended Sets where created to let all those who backed the project until the Black Friday weekend to get all the current Stretch Goals in one go. You can now access these bundles too.\nYou can only get the Extended set for the reward you have picked. The Extended Collector's bundles are grayed out because the corresponding reward tiers are all taken.\nTo upgrade your set to Extended, increase your pledge by the amount in the yellow box and contact me.\nAccording to the following list, for a couple of Extended Sets you will get more dice than specified in the sidebar description.\nThe green tabs indicate that some dice of a type glow in the dark. To learn the exact quantities, please refer to the full reward chart above.\nNeed extra dice? How to order more.\nIf your chosen reward level includes the \"Need extra dice?\" line, it means there is enough room for some more dice in your envelope, at the same shipping cost. A list of the possible options is available in the FAQ at the bottom of this page (\"What are the available options to get Extra Dice?\").\nExample: If you would like to add a couple of glowing d6 and one more couple of d10 to the One Anniversary Set reward (\u20ac15), select it and specify your shipping destination (i.e. \u20ac6 for Europe), then add the necessary amounts to the pledge:\n\u20ac21 for One Anniversary Set (that is, \u20ac15 + \u20ac6 for shipping to Europe)\n+ \u20ac11 for 2 Southern Sky d6 and 2 Solar System d10  \n\u20ac32 is the total pledge amount you would have to type in.\nPlease note that if you pledge extra for rewards that do not include the \"Need extra dice?\" line, I will consider that as a donation to the project. \n Stretch Goals!\nAs the project progresses, these Stretch Goals will be unlocked:\n\u20ac 6000: Free glow-in-the-dark paint on one of multiple d10 sets\nif your reward includes more than 2 Solar System Voyager dice (at least four d10) one couple will be upgraded to glow-in-the-dark free of charge!\nif you selected a pledge level with the line \"Need Extra Dice\" and will add more d10 as an extra, getting at least two couples of d10 (four dice) upgrading your pledge to meet the above condition, one couple will be upgraded to glow-in-the-dark free of charge!\nthis is valid for backers who increase their pledge before the counter hits \u20ac6000.\nthis doesn't apply to retailers bundles.\n\u20ac 7000: Free glow-in-the-dark paint as above (see update #10)  \nThe first Stretch Goal has been extended until the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 8000: One extra color option, also valid for the Northern Sky set \nYou will be able to specify your favorite color for both Constellation dice (d6) and Desired Constellation dice (fudge d6), and you will be able to specify which colors will glow in the dark if you are getting such dice.\nIf you choose Morning Sky color for your Constellation Dice, half will be from the Northern Sky set, while the other half will be Southern Skies.\nNew color unlocked: Morning Sky (light blue) also for the Northern dice\nFOR DICE INCLUDED IN YOUR REWARD TIER:\nThe available options for the Constellation dice are:\nall Sky Blue\nall Night Black\nall Morning Sky (in this case half will be from the Northern Sky set)\nmixed (if you need all tre colors, get at least six Constellation Dice)\nThe available options for your Desired Constellation d6 dice as well as for you Solar System Voyager d10 dice are:  \nall Sky Blue\nall Night Black  \nmixed\nFOR EXTRA DICE OBTAINED BY INCREASING YOUR PLEDGE:\nYou will be able to specify exactly what you want from what is available.\n\u20ac 10000: Lunar Phases d4 (Supermoon dice) and Zodiacal d12\nThe stars around the top vertex indicate the value of the roll.\n  Each side show the real costellation for the respective sign, starting with Aries at #1\nThese two dice will be available in Night Black color only until the \u20ac20,000 Stretch Goal. \n\u20ac 13000: Compass d8 and Milky Way d20\nA compass rotates on the equator of the dice.\n  Stars are more dense all around the dice where #1 and #20 are.\nThese two dice will be available in Sky Blue color only until the \u20ac16,500 Stretch Goal.\n\u20ac 14000: Advertising the project on Board Game Geek and Kicktraq\nThe ads will be running during the final week of the campaign.\n\u20ac 16500: Night Black color option for all polyhedrals (including d10)\nThe black Northern Sky dice is only available in some Collector's bundles.\n\u20ac 20000: Sky Blue color option for all polyhedrals (including d10)\nThe blue Northern Sky dice is only available in some Collector's bundles.\nLOCKED Stretch Goals:  \n\u20ac 25000: one FREE bonus dice for all the backers!\n1 Desired Constellation d6 for all backers of the 'sample' rewards.  \n1 Constellation dice d6 (Southern Sky, or light blue Northern Sky) for all others. \nThe color will be random, but I will try to match your set when packaging.\nHigh quality, low price (for now). Where is the catch?\nThis is actually several campaigns in one, launched together to offer great value to a broad audience, and let you save on combined shipping, expecially now that we have funded a full polyhedral set.\nBy bundling the dice their cost get averaged out, even if some versions are quite expensive (the glow-in-the-dark paint is applied by hand, almost doubling the manufacturing price).\nI am in contact with a few shops around the world that are booking my dice in advance at a very convenient price. This helped me lower the initial funding goal.\nI have kept the rewards cost at a minimum, to thank you all for helping me make this project a reality. To do this I had to order about 1000 of each design (mass production), and I will pay for the unclaimed dice with my own money.\nSince the funding goal will only be enough to cover manufacturing and shipping expenses, this convenience had to come at a cost.\nAny remaining dice after the campaign will be sold at retail price so don't miss this heavily discounted chance (there is no plan to reprint the dice once they are all gone).\nThis campaign is EU / U.S.A. friendly\nBackers the United States will not have to pay any custom fee since the shipping will be taken care of by a local distribution company. Moreover shipping to the United States will be tracked in most cases, even when the reward specifies \"Untracked Shipping\".\n1st Edition Ptolemaic Constellation Dice (Northern Sky)\nBackers from Europe will enjoy a little discount for untracked shipping as the rewards will be sent from Italy.\nTo get these dice after the campaign please subscribe to my newsletter and you will be notified when they will be available for purchase.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am an experienced designer and this is my second crowdfunding campaign. The first one was delivered in time with regular updates and positive comments from happy backers at https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/constellation-dice\n\nFor our german backers:\nhttp://bit.ly/GermanConstellationDice1\nhttp://bit.ly/GermanConstellationDice2\nhttp://bit.ly/GermanConstellationDice3 (this one has pictures)\n\nThe designs for this new project are ready and all fees and expenses have been taken into account, with a little margin for unexpected ones.\n\nAs soon as they are ready I shall receive and publish here pictures of the actual prototypes of the dice (the main image shows renderings, and your feedback is welcome, so it is possible the final product will appear slightly different).\n\nA quality output is expected because the bulk of the manufacturing will be taken care of by Q Workshop in Poland. This includes the d10 Voyager Dice and the Southern Sky Constellation Dice. The d6 Desired Constellation Dice will be manufactured in China with a custom mold, to allow the special design crossing the corners.\n\nThe main risk in a project like this is delays, but I have already taken into account one spare month. If all goes well, you will receive your rewards well in advance of the Voyagers' 40th anniversary in August, but probably later than the reported date of April 2017 (which didn't take into account the Stretch Goal manufacturing of full polyhedral sets).\n\nThe second risk is that some envelope may get lost during shipping. \nUntracked shipping is quite safe, inexpensive and reaches more locations. I have successfully sent hundreds of rewards this way last year. If anyway an envelope gets lost I will only be able to provide a proof of shipping, and tracking up to the moment it leaves the italian borders; for this reason I have provided the option for tracked shipping on more costly rewards.\n\nIt is your choice to pick tracked or untracked shipping, as I will not be able to resend more than a few packages (first come, first served) given the very limited budget I could allocate for that.\nI will do my best to help as usual, and I will try to locate both tracked and untracked shippings, as often it is just a matter of time before they arrive. Anyway I won't be able to resend/refund everyone in the unlikely event that a relevant number of packages is lost.\n\nPlease note that most the rewards destined to the U.S.A. shall be shipped with tracking from inside the country, making the risk even less.\n\nThe main challenge at the moment is to reach enough backers to reach all the Stretch Goals, the sooner the better.\n\nI trust you with this :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Notification Service", "descp": "Pledge to access the \"backers only\" updates, enjoy astronomy trivia and be alerted before the next limited offers will be published (great deals await!)\nAnd... many thanks for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac6 or more", "title": "LIMITED OFFER: Sample Dice Trio", "descp": "3 Dice (one is Glowing):\n1 Southern Sky d6 Dice (GLOWING)\n2 Desired Constellation d6 Dice\nShipping is UNTRACKED.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["35 backers", "Limited (15 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac9 or more", "title": "Sample Dice Colors", "descp": "4 Dice (the whole sky in your hands):\n1 Northern Sky Constellation Dice d6\n1 Southern Sky Constellation Dice d6\n2 Desired Constellation Dice d6\nThese dice will not glow in the dark.\nPick your favorite color option:\nA) Two light blue Constellation Dice,\nOne black, One blue Desired Constellation Dice\nB) One black, One light blue Constellation Dice,\nTwo blue Desired Constellation Dice\nC) One blue, One light blue Constellation Dice,\nTwo black Desired Constellation Dice\nShipping is UNTRACKED.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Desired Constellation Dice Bundle", "descp": "12 Desired Constellation d6 Dice\n(equivalent to 3 complete Fudge/FATE sets)\nNeed extra dice?

It all seems so easy! A small plot of land, a reception and a website is all you need to receive some income from tourists.\nSatisfied you take a rest \u2013 but not for long, as your guests already leave for greener pastures! They like your competitor's campground more: the \u2018Clash d\u2019Ard\u00e8che\u2019 has begun. \nClaim the best sites, bluff out your competitors, bribe the mayor and fulfill your secret assignment to win!\nWith this expansion pack, just bribe the mayor to be the one and only player with permission to receive camper-vans on your campground. Will you acquire this monopoly? The permit is given every season, so just take care to be the first in line!\nMRSP: \u20ac10, now on Kickstarter: \u20ac6 (shipping included). Content: 7 Camper-vans + rules.\n\nJust pledge your tier + \u20ac6 to receive one Camper-van expansion pack.\n                      The above is a prototype, not the final version of game components. Dutch gameplay video here.\nClash d\u2019Ard\u00e8che is a bluffing & strategic area control game for 1-4 players. In approximately one hour you start from scratch to end with a thriving campground.\nInvest your money wisely: buy the best facilities, broadcast radio commercials and bribe the mayor at the right time to expand and flourish. The bluffing element in the game is the time when you set the price you charge your guests. What price is set by your opponents? And how will their guests react to your price?\n\nBecause every player has a secret assignment with different victory conditions, players follow different strategies and replayability is high.\nSome upgrades for your campground\nThe two core game mechanics are the price-quality steps and the bribe cards. \nThe price-quality steps determine to which campground guests want to go. Influence those guests by building starbuildings on your campground and by charging them higher or lower prices. Because you don't know the price set by your competitors, this is the time when you have to bluff your way to the desired outcome. Be careful not to chase away your own guests though!\nThe bribe cards are a combination of worker placement, card drafting and set collection-mechanics. Different combinations of cigars, jewellery and wine get you powerful favors from the friendly mayor.\nIn the expert version another mechanic is added: the gameboard becomes a strategic puzzle as your guests want to camp nearby your sanitary, swimming pool or restaurant. Luckily you can also let them use your neighbours' facilities :-).\nHostel and Water Park camping upgrades\nSolo-game\nIn the solo-version of Clash d'Ard\u00e8che the friendly, but slightly corrupt mayor has gone megalomaniac. His nice country house in the outskirts of the small French village is no longer any good, he now demands the island as the vicinity for his mansion! Rules can be downloaded on our BGG-page.\nGames are shipped from within the USA and the EU, so no extra taxes apply. Shipping can be very complicated, but we want to keep it simple: we'll use the Royal Dutch Mail for worldwide shipping, Amazon Fulfillment for the USA and DHL for the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nShipping Costs:\nUSA, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium: \u20ac5\nEurope & Canada: \u20ac9\nWorldwide: \u20ac17\n  The rules and Print&Play files of the game are freely available on our BGG-page.   \nThe game comes with Dutch, French and English rules and cards.\nSome pics of the prototype:\nGameboard prototype\n   Two Campground upgrades\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaybe you've noticed we launched this game before, in june this year.

We've already unlocked those in green!\n  I've always considered myself a gamer, I was grew up during the vicious console wars of the 90's. Luckily I survived, and since being introduced to the world of the modern board game I've become somewhat obsessed. \nHaving built up a considerable collection, I couldn't help but be inspired to give back to the community that has given me so much joy. \nI want people to play more games. To achieve this I want to create games that appeal to a wide audience. That is why I created apauling games. We want to make games that are fun, engaging and contemporary. \nNothing To Declare is our first game. We've been working on it for some time and we have the rest of the project planned out to ensure that we deliver the game in a timely fashion. \n  I've been working on Nothing To Declare for about a year, in that time the game has gone through many iterations and improvements.\nThis has been a passion project of ours and it's now at a stage where we want to share it with you. This is the point where we cannot go any further without your help.\nTo make Nothing To Declare the best it can be we need to raise the funds to have it professionally manufactured.    \nWe really need you to make this game all it can be. We've got some cool things planned throughout the campaign to get everyone involved and make sure everyone has their say on the final product.\nThe art is 90% done and everything is lined up with our manufacturing and fulfillment partners we just need the funds to get over that final hurdle. \nBecause Nothing To Declare is a small box game we don't have to pay any large customs fees. This means we can offer worldwide friendly shipping and pass those savings on to you.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're familiar with board game Kickstarters you'll understand that there are things that affect all board game Kickstarters. \n\nMostly the biggest risks are around shipping and fulfillment.

Play as the stalwart Samurai Warrior, using your mastery of the Katana and your bushido code of honor to defeat your foes in combat, the nimble and deadly ninja Assassin, using stealth and speed as weapons, the Traveling Monk, a member of an ancient Yamabushi order devoted to fighting supernatural creatures wherever they may be found, and the powerful and mystic Sorceress, who wields Elemental Magik to crush her enemies.\n    Set in Feudal Japan, the Heroes must brave the Forbidden Fortress; a feudal castle overrun with all manner of Demons, Ghosts, and Monsters inspired by Japanese myth and legend. The massive Oni, red beast-like ogres wielding giant clubs, stalk the halls, while deadly Tengu sword masters descend from the skies with their raven wings to attack the Heroes. Legions of Samurai Dishonored Dead rise from the grave, and writhing Acidic Tentacles burst from the floor to spit acid and feed on the Heroes with their razor sharp teeth.\nBut at the heart of the fortress lie the most terrifying and epic foes of all; the Harionago, a ghostly, demonic woman, held aloft by the twisting strands of her animated hair, which is also used to entangle and slash at the Heroes with its vicious barbs, and the towering Living Statue, possessed by Darkness to break away from its posts, wreaking havoc and smashing the castle it was once built to protect!\nWe've just added a Surprise Bonus to both Sumo and Shogun Pledges!\n Game Features\nIncludes 27 beautifully detailed, multi piece hard plastic, 32mm scale game miniatures for the Heroes and Enemies, each designed with dynamic poses and detail perfect for painting.\nImmersive adventures and story driven gameplay, using the expansive and popular Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 Game Engine.\nFully Cooperative, with all of the players working together against the game itself\nDynamically generated adventures, 12 different Missions, and 4 unique Heroes with many options for customization, the game is designed for massive replayability.\nEasy to learn with simple but fun gameplay and rewarding thematic story moments as you progress your Heroes.\nBuilt-in Campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level.\nHeroes can visit a Feudal Japanese Village between mission to re-stock and re-supply before the next adventure, having a mini-adventure in town.\nDouble-sided Map Tiles include a Forbidden Fortress of Feudal Japan on one side and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld on the back side for the Heroes to explore; stepping through a shimmering portal and continuing their adventures in an alien world inside of a massive living creature.\nOver 250 game cards, a full set of beautifully illustrated, double-sided Map Tiles, a host of dice and counters, and all of the large Hero and Enemy record sheets needed to play\nIncludes a CD Soundtrack of original Music, created to set the mood while playing.\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress can be played on its own as a stand-alone game, or it can be used in combination with any and all of the other Shadows of Brimstone products already available! It is fully compatible, in every way! For new players, Forbidden Fortress will make a great introduction to the world of Shadows of Brimstone, and for veteran players, it adds a ton of new content, including two brand new Worlds to explore - the Japanese castles and temples of the Forbidden Fortress and a living world inside a massive creature in the Belly of the Beast. It also includes a brand new set of Heroes and Enemies to add to your games. With the option of starting your Heroes in Feudal Japan or the Old West, or having a mixed party of Heroes, drawn from both worlds, the possibilities are endless!\nThe Belly of the Beast OtherWorld\nForbidden Fortress also adds a brand new OtherWorld on the back side of the Map Tiles\u2026 The Belly of the Beast! Backers from the original Brimstone Kickstarter may recognize this as an OtherWorld Stretch Goal that was not unlocked during the original campaign. When we started formalizing what would be in Forbidden Fortress, the idea of adding the Belly of the Beast as the OtherWorld on the back side of the tiles was a perfect fit! What could be more in keeping with the Japanese theme than allowing the Heroes to find their way through a portal that leads inside of an unspeakably massive creature; battling all sorts of living organs and parasites, and fighting off the Flesh Mites, Acid Blobs, and Parasitic Tentacles that inhabit this \u2018living\u2019 world.\nWhat You Get in the Core Set Box\nThe Core Set for Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress includes all of the following:\n(Note that the final version of contents may vary from those shown here).\nThe Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion\nThe Temple of Shadows was once the home of an ancient and powerful order of Yamabushi monks, dedicated to battling supernatural creatures throughout the land. It was foretold that one day the Great Dragon King, Sho-Riu would return to destroy the Earth, and only they could stop him. When the meteor came from the heavens and devastated the mountain, the Dragon King came with it. For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.\nBut their victory was not to be. Reigning down death and destruction, the Dragon King broke through the monk\u2019s defenses and utterly destroyed the order, devouring their souls and bringing Darkness and shadow into the sacred temple. Those few that survived were scattered and leaderless, but they would not sit idle. Traveling the roads and countryside, the last of the monks dedicated their lives to finding new Heroes that could one day fulfill the prophecy and reclaim\u2026 the Temple of Shadows!\nBuilding on the themes from the Forbidden Fortress Core Set, the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion adds a ton of new content for the Feudal Japan setting and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld. This boxed set includes:\n4 New Hero Classes\nEnforcer \u2013 An outlaw and a gangster, the Enforcer is an anti-Hero renegade who favors brute strength and intimidation over elegant fighting weapons and technique. His tattooed body is hardened and scarred from a lifetime of brutal brawling.\nGeisha \u2013 Beautiful but deadly, the Geisha is a cunning and stealthful fighter. She employs deception and trickery to evade and confuse enemies, while slashing with her hidden blade from behind. Her comforting presence can heal the Heroes, both body and soul, to keep them in the fight.\nSoldier \u2013 The Soldier is a veteran of warfare who has seen many battles and is an expert marksman with his Rifle. Though he does not have the style or family heritage of the Samurai, he is a hardened foot soldier that has access to a variety of different weapons and training.\nKitsune \u2013 A guardian spirit, the Kitsune has come forward to defend this world against the demons and creatures that would threaten to destroy it. Taking on a human-fox form, the Kitsune uses supernatural tricks and auras to protect the Heroes, while darting between enemies to deliver killing blows with her deadly blades.\n4 New Enemy Types\nChochinobake \u2013 These demon-possessed, animated lanterns swarm the Heroes, relentlessly biting and burning them with terrifying speed.\nTakobake Warriors \u2013 Once a noble clan, the Takobake have embraced the power of the Dark Stone. Using its energy to grow in strength, they have become mutated into tentacled monstrosities, twisted and evil.\nSkin Crawlers \u2013 These large, parasitic creatures burrow through the flesh and muscle walls in the Belly of the Beast, rising up from the pools of sticky mucus to assault any Heroes foolish enough to enter into their feeding grounds.\nThe Fallen Shogun \u2013 This dreadful leader of the Takobake clan was one of the first to discover the magical properties of the Dark Stone. Weaving it into his armor, and forging it into weapons, he has gone mad with power, mutating into a giant among men! Declaring himself Shogun, he now sweeps across the land with his legions of mutated soldiers, conquering any who would stand in his way.\nNew Material for the Forbidden Fortress and Belly of the Beast\nThis expansion also features 4 new double-sided Map Tiles with new rooms for the Forbidden Fortress on one side and the Belly of the Beast on the other, 6 New Missions for the Temple of Shadows, loads of new cards and counters, and much more!\n.\nWhat You Get in the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion Box\nThe Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion includes all of the following:\n(Note that the final version of contents may vary from those shown here). Box Cover Art is Stand-in.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThere are two Kickstarter Exclusive Hero Classes created for this campaign.\nAs part of the Sumo Pledge Level, a backer will get the KS Exclusive Sumo Hero Class.\nSumo \u2013 A massive and imposing figure, the Sumo has trained all his life for unarmed battle in the wrestling ring. But when Demons and Monsters sweep across the land, he answers the call, stepping out of the ring and onto the battlefield.\nMounted on a 40mm base, the Sumo is the first ever large size Hero. He uses his weight and strength to mercilessly crush his foes, pushing enemies around the board and body slamming them with unbridled fury.\nAs part of the Shogun Pledge Level, a backer will also get the KS Exclusive Samurai Daimyo Hero Class, which also includes 3 Armored Ashigaru Foot Soldiers for him to command!\nSamurai Daimyo \u2013 A clan leader and military general, the Samurai Daimyo uses strategy and tactics to outwit and outmaneuver his opponents. As a powerful commander and trained Samurai warrior, he leads his armies into combat, for honor and glory!\nThe Samurai Daimyo starts each adventure with up to 3 Armored Ashigaru Foot Soldier Allies to command. In addition to being a skilled fighter, the Daimyo is also a natural leader, and many of his skills and abilities focus on giving bonuses to the rest of the Heroes and his Foot Soldiers\nStretch Goals\nThere are 2 types of Stretch Goals that can be unlocked during the course of this Kickstarter campaign: Sumo Level Stretch Goals (marked in Light Tan) and Shogun Level Stretch Goals (marked in Purple).\nSumo Level Pledges will receive only the Light Tan Sumo Level Stretch Goals, while Shogun Level Pledges will receive both the Light Tan Sumo Level Stretch Goals as well as all of the Purple Shogun Level Stretch Goals. \nHow To Purchase Add-Ons\nTo purchase items from the Add-Ons Menu below, simply click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button at the top of this page and increase your pledge amount to include the additional cost of the items that you\u2019d like to get. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want yet, that will happen in the Pledge Manager after the Forbidden Fortress KS Campaign has finished.\nHow Does the Game Play?\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress is a fully-cooperative, Dungeon Crawl adventure game! That means that all of the players form a Hero team (or you can play solo) and are working together against the game itself, entering the torch-lit castle gates and exploring dark courtyards and mysterious chambers within a fortress that has been overrun with creatures and demons!  The team can take on different missions from the Adventure Book, each with unique set up and victory conditions. You may be searching for a sacred artifact, stolen from the nearby temple by demons and carried off to the dark fortress, or you might be tasked with sealing off portals that unspeakable creatures are pouring out of!\n1-4 Players (or up to 6 Players if combined with the Temple of Shadows Expansion) create their Heroes by selecting a Hero Class to play, such as the Samurai Warrior or Sorceress. That Hero Class defines your basic character stats - how much Health and Sanity you have, how good you are at hitting enemies with your Katana, how good you are at solving puzzles or dodging fiendish traps, etc. It also defines your basic starting Gear - do you start with a sword, a staff, shuriken? Also, any abilities that all characters of your Hero Class share (a Samurai\u2019s \"Code of Honor\" for example). Each Hero also starts with a Random Personal Item that gives them a bit more \u2018character\u2019, and they get to choose one of three Starting Upgrades unique to their Hero Class. This gives players a chance to start guiding their Hero\u2019s development right from the outset!\nOnce your team is ready to go, the players roll (or decide) what Mission they have taken on and the game begins! Each Hero is represented by a figure on the game board and all of the figures are placed on the Fortress Entrance Map Tile to start the game. All of the Card Decks are shuffled, each Hero gets 1 Grit Token, and the Depth Track is setup with the Hero Party\u2019s marker on the entrance and the Darkness marker deep in the fortress (at the opposite end of the track).\nAt the start of each turn, the Hero with the Lantern rolls 2 dice to Hold Back the Darkness! This roll needs to be equal to or greater than the number listed on the current stage of the Depth Track. If the roll is passed, the Heroes carry on without delay. If the roll is failed, the Darkness moves one step up the track toward escaping the fortress! But beware, if the Darkness marker ever reaches the entrance space on the Depth Track, it has escaped, and the mission is failed. As an added element of danger, if the Hold Back the Darkness roll is ever doubles (1-1, 3-3, etc), this instead triggers a random event from the Depth Event Chart equal to that number!\nHeroes now take their turn in order of Initiative, with the highest going first. During a Hero\u2019s Activation, they roll a die and may move up to the amount rolled. If a 1 is rolled, the Hero also recovers an extra Grit Token. Grit Tokens are used for a number of things in game. A Grit Token may be discarded to Re-roll any number of your dice just rolled (though no die may be Re-rolled more than once), or a Grit Token may be discarded to move an extra die roll worth of spaces during your Movement. A Grit Token may also be used to activate certain powerful character abilities.\nAfter moving, the Hero may attack if there are any enemies on the board, or if they have ended their move in a space adjacent to a doorway (an open exit from the map tile you are on), you may look down the hall and draw a random Map Card to place the next Map Tile, connecting it to the doorway you are looking through. Each time a new Map Tile is placed, you must also move the Hero Party\u2019s marker one step forward on the Depth Track, as the Hero Team delves deeper into the fortress. This is important because as the Heroes go deeper underground, it becomes harder and harder to Hold Back the Darkness (the number required to roll gets higher, the deeper the Hero Party has gone).\nNewly placed Map Tiles are always either a Room or a Passage. Passage Tiles have open doorways on all ends and can often split the path in front of the Heroes. They do not, however, contain Encounters for the Heroes to deal with. Room Tiles, on the other hand, always come into play with an Exploration Token on them. As long as there is an unrevealed Exploration Token on a Map Tile, Heroes may not look through Doorways on that Map Tile (you can\u2019t explore further than that room with the unrevealed token). At the end of a full Hero Turn (after all Heroes have been Activated), if there are one or more Heroes in a Room with an Exploration Token, that token is revealed!\nWhile exploring, Heroes can find large, swirling portals that the Enemies are coming through to attack, and they can step through those gateways into a crazy alien World, continuing their adventures on the other side! All of the Map Tiles are double-sided, with the Fortress on one side and an alien OtherWorld on the back side. In Shadows of Brimstone:  Forbidden Fortress, the alien World included is the Belly of the Beast! Stepping through the portal, the Heroes find themselves inside an unfathomably large creature, exploring the living passages and inner chambers of its massive body, dripping with goo and overrun with parasites and living defenses.\nOnce the Heroes have reached their objective for the mission being played, they will often have one final Epic battle with an Enemy boss to complete the Adventure!\nBetween Adventures, the Heroes can travel back to a nearby Japanese Village to re-stock and re-supply, having a mini-Adventure in Town before setting out on the next Mission.\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress has a built in campaign system allowing the players to keep their Heroes from game to game, finding cool new Gear and Artifacts that they can use in their continuing Adventures, while gaining experience and going up in level to unlock new skills chosen from their Class-Specific Skill Tree.\nGame Miniatures\nThe Miniatures included in Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress and the Temple of Shadows Expansion are multi-part HIPS hard plastic. They come on frames and do require some assembly. We have taken great care to make the assembly in as few pieces per model as possible, while still getting a high level of detail and fantastic, dynamic poses. This also brings an aspect of Hobby to the game as many players find it fun to customize and paint their figures.\nShipping\nThis project is US, EU, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly Shipping!\nOur intent is to ship all Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals for this KS project as a single shipping Wave.\nHowever, all extra Add-On items (added individually beyond your Pledge Level/Stretch Goals) will be shipped separately from the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals, and will  likely ship AFTER the main Pledge Rewards/Stretch Goals.\nExtra Add-on items are US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia Friendly. They will be packed and delivered to our distribution centers in the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia (at our expense) and then shipped to individual Backer addresses from within the EU, UK, Canada, and Australia for Backers in those regions.\nShipping and handling charges are not included in the pledge levels. We will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter ends, based on the actual costs to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards (at our cost) to our distribution centers in the US (in Washington State), Australia, UK, Canada, and the EU. Backers will then be responsible for shipping charges from the most appropriate distribution center to your address. \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package for the Sumo and Shogun Pledge Levels.

First appearing as a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 was released to retail in late 2014 and has been going strong ever since.\nThe game supports 1-6 players, has a standard game time of 2-3 hours, and includes a campaign system for keeping your Hero characters from game to game, finding new items on your adventures and gaining new skills and abilities as you go up in level. You can also visit an Old West Frontier Town between adventures to re-stock and re-supply before setting out on your next mission, and during the game, you can find the swirling portals that the terrifying enemies are coming from, and you can step through those gateways to continue your adventures on the other side, in another dimension or alien world. The map tiles are all double-sided, with the Old West Mines on one side and an alien environment on the other side.\nOne of the main features of Shadows of Brimstone\u2122 is that all of the players work together against the game itself, and that everything is card-based and dynamically generated as you play (the encounters, enemies, board layout, etc.), meaning that the game never plays the same way twice.\nFlying Frog Productions\nFlying Frog Productions, LLC is a premier traditional game company that focuses on fun, theme-heavy, story driven board games. Their first game, Last Night on Earth\u2122, made a big splash when it launched in 2007, and since then they have released many more games such as A Touch of Evil\u2122, Fortune and Glory\u2122, and Shadows of Brimstone\u2122, as well as dozens of expansions to provide continued support for all of their game lines. You can find more information about Flying Frog Productions at www.flyingfrog.net, flyingfrogwiki.com, as well as their pages on Facebook, Twitter, and www.BoardGameGeek.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an established game company, Flying Frog Productions has been making high quality, thematic, fun games for nearly ten years! We launched our first Kickstarter Campaign in October of 2013 for the original Shadows of Brimstone, and have been through the process, working out the pipeline and navigating the hurdles. That project was enormous, with many moving parts, and logistical challenges. We have learned many lessons from that experience that will go into making this new Kickstarter project even better! The success of the first Kickstarter campaign allowed us to hire additional staff in our studio and find new manufacturing contacts who can produce higher quality miniatures and components.\n\nMiniatures \u2013 We have been producing HIPS hard plastic, multi-part figures for over 3 years now, working with several factories to refine the pipeline and process. The results are figures that keep getting better and better detail and quality, both in the tooling of the molds and the sculpting of the figures. The miniatures in Forbidden Fortress are some of our absolute best to date, and we are very excited for backers to see the level of detail on these figures.\n\nDelivery Timeline \u2013 \"Is March 2018 a realistic Delivery timeframe for this project?\"\nYes. By going through the (admittedly long) process of the first Shadows of Brimstone KS, we developed the pipeline and the tools needed to complete a project like this. Most of the rules and systems for the game are already in place, and this project is all about adding a lot of fun new content that builds on the established Game Engine.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to giving this project a faster delivery time than the original Shadows of Brimstone KS:\n- The Pledge Levels are streamlined to give only 2 variations on Rewards to be delivered, Sumo Level and Shogun Level boxes.\n- Pledge Rewards will be packed and shipped from China directly to our distribution facilities around the world in the US, Australia, Canada, UK, and EU.\n- Extra Add-ons added beyond the Pledge Rewards and Stretch Goals will be packed separately on a per backer basis. Extra Add-Ons will be shipped separately using EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia Friendly shipping to allow backers to add extra items without slowing down the main project delivery timeline.\n- The project has been scoped to better fit the production window and estimated delivery of March 2018.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Lotus Level", "descp": "You get an exclusive Forbidden Fortress Art Print signed by the Flying Frog Team. ***This will ship from the USA***\nINCLUDES:\nSigned Forbidden Fortress Art Print", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["59 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Sumo Level", "descp": "You get the Forbidden Fortress Core Set Boardgame, the Kickstarter-Exclusive Sumo Hero Class with Male Sumo Miniature, plus all 'Sumo Level' Stretch Goals unlocked during the Campaign. ***Shipping will be charged after the campaign ends (see Shipping section for details)***\nINCLUDES:\nShadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress Core Set\nKS Exclusive Sumo Hero Class\nSumo Level Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["638 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Map Maker (Sumo) Level", "descp": "You get the Sumo Level plus a location on the Shadows of Brimstone: Forbidden Fortress Map will be named for you, and you will receive a poster-sized art print of the Map, autographed by the Map Artist and the Creators of the game.

You recruited volunteers, set up demo tables, and built up your booth. Your games are selling like cardboard hotcakes. All is well until you turn around, and your shiny new cash box is gone...\nThis is Steal This Game, based on a true story.\nOn Saturday, 15 October 2016, around 4 pm, our cashier realized that in the 10 seconds it took to look in our warehouse for a game, our cash box was gone.\nFor a small indie board game publisher, this represents a significant loss. Besides the financial hit, this has also affected us on an emotional level.\nGames are fun. Gamers are fun. They are also some of the most welcoming, generous, and trusting people around. For this to happen during the greatest celebration of cardboard & wood in all of boardgamedom is a devastating blow.\nAccording to what venue security told us when we submitted the police report, this is likely the work of professionals. Fellow friendly publishers have indicated that they noticed similar attempts or approaches by individuals that did not seem to know much about the hobby. We hope and assume that this was not done by any gamer.\nTHE GAME\nThe card front (draft)\nThis asymmetric nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). One player takes on the role of a boardgame publisher at a big convention.\nThe other player is a thief, intent on robbing the publisher's booth \u2014 rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.\nThe card back (draft)\nThe exhibitor tries to keep the cash hidden in one of the four cash boxes. The thief secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves in order to gain more information about the location of the cash.\nIf the exhibitor catches the thief while attempting this, the thief makes one last attempt to steal. If that fails, then the exhibitor wins.\nUPDATE\nNew design (work in progress):\nRULES\nFor more details on the components and rules of Steal This Game, download the rule book here (right click and Save as\u2026).

EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have the base game cost declared as the value of the package (the shipping cost will not be included in the declaration). The postcards are not subject to taxes.\nThe postcard will be sent through regular mail. Tracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over.\nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Hungary, Russia, or South Africa.\nThere is a large number of incredibly talented and even more generous people that we would like to thank.\nFirst among them is David Turczi, who never even said \"of course\" when asked to design this game.

Thanks for your time, hope to have saved yours.*\nSpecial Notes: 3k Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nFull Campaign Details below. \nHello :) Welcome to my Fourth Kickstarter known as \"Meanders\": giant modular boards strewn with wandering paths that fit together with other similar-themed Meander. This Kickstarter is aimed at that special need for terrain between quests. A place for all of the stuff that happens in the beloved - but oft overlooked - mid-way point: shortly after departure from the tavern/spaceport/craft and just before the arrival at the dragon-filled mountain range or Alien Queens acid filled biomass cavern.\nWhat happens between setting off and finally arriving is perhaps the most important aspect of RPG to capture the imagination, for the Journey from Here to There represents endless possibility for stories to evolve, a mystical place for stumbling upon new side-quests, sudden action, the excitement of exploration and the threat of random encounters where anything can happen and often does.\nYet while they are particularly intended for areas after leaving the tavern/spaceship and before reaching the location of major quests - allowing players to wander the wilderness or planetary landscape - they also serve up a number of classic RPG tropes for situating major quests such as: a Desert Shipwreck or Temple Ruins, Woodland Altar or Forest Pond, Alpine Cemetery or Jungle Swingbridge. Each board has a mixture of narrow and wide paths with multiple clearings for hiding treasure chests, trapdoors, entrances to your dungeons or your custom secrets and strategic terrain design for setting up ambushes, wandering monster or NPC encounters and even labyrinths. Need an endless desert? Enchanted forest that won't let them leave? Lost in the snow? Meanders can take care of it for you. \nMeanders provide instant and massive adventure vistas for characters to wander through a variety of classic (and not-so-classic) tropes: from sprawling forest and steaming jungle, miles of snow or near-endless desert - and how big you make the playground is up to you. Simply join another board or boards of the same or different theme to your Meander and it will line up all of the paths, doubling, trebling or quadrupling the size of the Meander. Create a gigantic sprawling landscape just waiting to be populated with NPC's, monsters, treasure and Meanders provides enough caverns, clearings and paths to lead almost anywhere... \nWhile the majority of my completed pieces are Fantasy based - I am creating terrain for the Sci-fi RPGer's with plans for a gigantic Space Hulk, Deep Space, Planet Surfaces and Geiger-esque terrain suitable for Tyranids, Alien, Space Marines, Chthulu, and whatever else we can think of.\nMeanders are beautifully and carefully illustrated with shadows, lighting, realism and depth: take a look at these artwork samples.\nForest Themed Meanders\n  Jungle Themed Meanders\n  Snow Themed Meanders\n  Desert Themed Meanders\n      Gemstone Caverns Meanders\n  Alien Terrain\n  Chthulian Dimensions\n  1 of 4 Underdark Designs Unlocked @ 3k\nEach Meander measures 27 x 18\" each and is professionally printed on 60pt chipboard covered with matt finish paper on one side and black backing on the other with a dry/wet erasable finish. These are thick, high-quality durable dry/wet erase boards that unfold into a six-fold board or up into a 9\" square observable in the campaign video. This is a similar tried and tested board used for one of my previous Kickstarters for Urban Rooftops (please see below). You can also select various grid or no grid options and up to 4 individual terrain boards per themed-set (with some derivations available via stretch goals).\nMeanders are also designed with identical entrances/exits on each board - plus overlapping foliage - that helps blend the boards together when paired so you can easily enlarge the size of the Meander from a short walk (1-2 boards) to a days ride (4 boards) to an epic sojourn through snow, desert, forest and jungle. (6+ boards) without that harsh clash of contrasts or mis-matching trees. Each board in its own series fits with the others.\nMeanders can theoretically be joined to different terrains in the same series because the paths all occupy identical points: the join is not as neat, but it can be done.\nADDITIONAL OPTIONS\nPlease note: there will be a free option to have Meanders electronically joined to each other for your convenience at the end of the campaign. My computer processing will only allow me to do this with a maximum of four Meanders at a go but I can do it in separate blocks of 2-4 if you choose. I will of course adjust the grid so there is no overlap.  \nPlease also note: For an extra $2 per Meander I offer a service to join and blend terrains into one another more gradually so that you can place Snow by Forest without the overly harsh contrast and obvious join for instance. This is for those of you who enjoy the art but don't necessarily need modular terrain and are quite happy to have the 'four seasons' or don't need to change the terrain around. I.e. if you wanted your Sampler pack joined and you chose four different terrains this would be a good option to go with to have them blend into one another as one giant map and only cost you $16 in total. $8 for the sampler, $8 for the blend.\nFor some Boards, i.e. the Alien or Planetscapes there is an open colour choice so that you can get the planet surface colour you need to suit your games. \nAdvantages of using Meanders over 8x8\", 10x10\" tiles are many:\nInstant Terrain: No more time spent setting up smaller terrain squares: Meanders are huge 27x18\" modular boards designed to flow on to and fit with one another. Why move ten tile squares when you can move one board?\nModifiable Size: Meanders can be folded in such a way to provide 18x9\", 18x18\", or the full 27x18\" terrain template. (please see campaign video.)\nVariation: By mix and matching Meanders you can achieve a range of different terrain arrangements within a single theme simply by moving the boards around one another OR pair them with other terrains to make an entire world.\nTough: Meanders are professionally printed on six-fold boads with a tough wet/dry erase, scuff/oil/liquid resistant coating.\nPortable: Meanders fold down into a compact 9\" for light-weight portability.\nFlexibility: Using 1\" squares, Meanders fit the scale of existing 1\" RPG tiles and boards.\nGrid Options: Choose No Grid, 1\" Grid, Hex Grid or Cross-Hair.\n100% Completed Art: The art for 16 different Meanders, 4 each in Forest, Snow, Desert and Jungle terrain are fully completed. \nDigital/Printed or Both: Get the digital designs, printed boards, or both.\nImprovisation: Effortlessly add a huge Forest, Jungle or Desert to your game for your adventurers to explore, set up camp, be ambushed, for side and escort quests, or stretch out the campaign.\nElement of Surprise: Sit your castle, cave, town, lake or other destination tiles/set-up on the black reverse of a folded board or at the edge of a path of a Meander and let your adventurers work their way through the traps, encounters and adventure towards it.\nJoin and Blend Options: You can have your Meanders joined to one another for absolutely free: with up to 4 Meanders joined into one map AND you can pay a few extra dollars to have your Meanders joined and neatly custom blended into one another to create a nice seamless flow between terrains for just $2 per Meander.\nInexpensive: Get (Edit: 36+) giant 27x18\" Meanders for $25 AUD. No other kickstarter has ever offered this much quality terrain for such an amazing price.\nWant to break down what I'm offering for just $25?\n4 Forest Meanders\n4 Snow Meanders\n4 Desert Meanders\n4 Jungle Meanders\n6 Fantasy City / Castle & Frost Castle Meanders\n4 Alien Terrain Meanders\n2 Autumn Meanders\n2 Nocturnal Meanders\n2 Village and Fields Meanders\n2 Elven Treetop City Meanders\n2 Gemstone Cavern Meanders\n& all those digital goodies are yours if the campaign funds. Go beyond funding and it gets even crazier. And since we did, it has.\nBesides the 36 Core Meanders - Extra themed Meanders to choose from can be unlocked and added to your $25+ pledge just through the project funding: with the potential for even more additional designs to be added through achieving the following Stretch Goals.\n ... And should there be time - whatever else you and I can come up with.\n This is my Fourth Kickstarter on the back of three previously successfully           funded campaigns bringing creative innovations to life for RPG.\nThank you very much for your support and encouragement - I look forward to bringing these to a table-top near you - and as always please let me know if you have any questions about the campaign.\nKind Regards,\nKris McDermott\n *Skinny Bar concept inspired by August Hahn.\nConcepts in Development:\n An {im} possible Meander.\n  Frost-gravian style ice Castle\n     Alien Terrain Hostile Takeover Biomass\nIn Design but No Art to show yet: Sci-fi Meanders with a massive Space Hulk ...

A quick check into my previous Kickstarter with Deluxe Reversible Rooftop Tiles or Soloman Temple Squares for RPG will indicate rapid delivery and full backer satisfaction with my products as well as full communication the entire campaign through. I work extremely hard to make sure my backers are happy with the products I make and to ensure everyone gets their rewards on or or before time. \n\nIf there are any difficulties backers will immediately be notified and all possible steps taken to remedy them - but it is my experience that my production, manufacture and shipping is a stream-lined operation and backers can expect their rewards on time if not before time. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions, concerns about the product or my campaign - I am always here to offer rapid response.

Each set is delivered in a downloadable .stl format via our online distribution partner DriveThruRPG.com, and once you have the set, you can print as many pieces as you like and never run out or need to purchase more.

A really nice starter printer that can print these files starts around $390 (see our F.A.Q. for more info on printers, printing costs, filaments, and more.)\nEven if you don't currently own a 3D printer, it benefits you to support this campaign now.

We have had tons of new ideas, and many of you have too, from the many requests that we've received. \nThe goal of this Kickstarter project is to create quite a few brand new deluxe Character Meeples, some for use in particular games (Codenames, Colt Express, Near and Far, Stone Age, Imperial Settlers, Aquasphere, Champions of Midgard, Forbidden Island, Forbidden Desert, Targi, and more), and others for use in any game you love - simply because they are awesome!\nWe are proud to offer flat rate shipping for all backers. This means you can add-on your favorite sets (and individuals) without affecting your shipping amount - no limit!\n               A mock-up of the Codenames meeples in action!\n  Perfect for Champions of Midgard!\n    All pledge levels can also be an add-on! That means that if you want more than one set, simply choose your main pledge level and add the amount of the additional set(s). It's that easy!\n  We don't want anything to stand between you and some really fantastic Character Meeples. That is why we offer all of our Kickstarter backers an unconditional money-back guarantee (within 30 days of receiving your meeples). Your only responsibility would be the return shipping, but that is fairly inexpensive, as the pieces are small and light. We are that confident that you\u2019ll love \u2018em!\nAll orders are quality-controlled, packaged, and shipped with care from the Meeple Source lair in Orlando, FL. We do not use any outside fulfillment centers, here in the US or internationally. \n    Chris and Cynthia Landon are the siblings that own and operate Meeple Source. Andrea is the fantastic artist behind all of these new Character Meeples, and the overwhelming majority of our Character Meeples and upgraded resource bits to date. Karen and Erika are an incredibly important part of our quality control, packaging, and shipping team. \nLocated in Orlando, FL, we are a small family business that takes great pride in superb product quality and excellent customer service!\n  We have already created an enormous number of cool game pieces and accessories, so feel free to browse some of that past work on MeepleSource.com.\nImperial Settlers\n  Orl\u00e9ans\n         Puerto Rico\n  Since we have way too many to show off here, use these category links to see more...\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMeeple Source has been making detailed, full-color Character Meeples for five years now. We are proud to say that we have a reputation for high quality pieces and great customer service.\n\nEven with the success of our 7 completed Kickstarter projects to date, we are still a very small, family-run company that takes great pride in taking care of our customers and their orders personally. As a result, in combination with the enormous number of custom product combinations that we allow in our Kickstarter projects, shipping takes a good deal of time. To help with this, we have created some handy packages in this project, including themed sets and mixed packs of unique characters, that are designed to speed up fulfillment.\n\nIf you are one of our many repeat Kickstarter backers, you may know that a couple of our projects experienced minor delays, and that we were always straight-forward with regard to that. A distinct possibility for delay lies in the painting of the meeples. Although every individual meeple is hand-sorted for quality control, by us personally, there are times that errors in screen printing require that we re-make the entire batch of pieces for that particular Character Meeple. If this occurs, it will take a minimum of 8-10 weeks to replace them, which could delay shipping. For example, if this were to occur only a month before shipping would otherwise commence, some pledges would deliver after the estimated delivery date. Although we believe that we have allotted plenty of time for situations such as this, it should be noted that project delays are still a possibility. \n\nMore than anything, we are committed to quality.

The game gained a lot of popularity, and got high average rating on BGG. We are proud to have the most dedicated supporters and here we want to thank everyone of them for their enthusiasm and effort to help us in our journey. And after the first challenge is completed, we are ready for the next adventure. \nWe are happy to announce our first BIG! Expansion for Battalia the Creation. Here you will have the opportunity to get your copy of Battalia: The Stormgates, Crowdfunding Edition (CEdition). For newcomers in our universe there is a second chance to lay hands on the base game Battalia: The Creation, Crowdfunding edition or directly on a big combo package including both of them :) .\n  Important note: NO RETAIL version of the Stormgates CEdition expansion box is scheduled for next year and in our general plans. For now we prefer to work only for the Kickstarter community due to many meaningful reasons and the only one not to call the whole box officially Kickstarter exclusive is that we will distribute some minor quantities of games to some loyal retailers due to the round up needed to produce a reasonable number of this edition in the planned print run. Those will be only insignificant numbers and for sure it will be very unlikely to distribute them overseas due to some logistic and other issues.\nREAL SHOT 1 - BASIC 4 PLAYER GAME\n  REAL SHOT 2 - COMMON CARD POOL AND SUN ORACLE\n  REAL SHOT 3 - LARGE MINIATURES FROM THE BASIC SET\n  REAL SHOT 4 - THE PAINTED VERSION (delivered unpainted)\n  REAL SHOT 5 - PAINTED MINIS IN ACTION\n  REAL SHOT 6 - COLORFUL IDEAS FOR YOUR IMAGINATION\n  The game concept\nBATTALIA: The Creation is a medium weight strategy game for 2-4 players, ages 13 and up. It combines the mechanics of map construction, deck building, hero and area control and neat calendar mechanics. \nIn this game of creation and conquest the players will send their heroes on an epic journey to explore new territories and take control over neutral or enemy cities. They will hire battle units, and acquire useful artefacts, with the greater goal to create mighty nations and unbeatable armies. Every player will construct roads to gain access to new map areas and will build or upgrade cities, in order to expand his domain and to earn victory points. Battalia: The Creation can be won through intensive development and growth of your own city system, or through aggressive play of war and conquer, capturing opponents settlements.\nBase Game Features:  \nLanguage independent  \nBasic game mode  \nAdvanced game mode for experienced players   \nAlternative game scenario - The Bleading horn of destiny.  \nModular map, built during the game   \nHighly detailed big scale miniatures   \nUnique calendar mechanics   \nUnique cards purchase mechanics\nThe game rules are available in 15 languages.

This allows us to charge more individual and fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.\n\nBased on our previous experience with direct shipping, we've decided to have a different approach this time. We are working on building up of two shipping hubs at least in the US and Europe (calculated on the base of our previous campaign). Depending on the number of backers an Asia and Australia hubs are in consideration. For all overseas and faraway countries with lower number of backers we will deliver directly per courier. Exact calculations are possible after campaign ends.\nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping for your convenience* :\nSTORMGATES Pledge \nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15 \n BG: free pick up or $3 \n Rest of the World : $15-$20\nCREATION Pledge:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15  \n BG: free pick up or $3  \n Rest of the World : $15-$20\nCOMBO Pledge:\nUS & CA : $20-$25 / EU : $15 -$20  \nBG: free pick up or $5  \nRest of the World : $25-$30\nALL COHORT Pledges\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25 \n BG: free pick up or $8 \n Rest of the World : $60-$90\nADD-ONS\nAll destinations fixed: $1 - flat rate per unit!\nPlease note that the shipping may vary from the numbers above and cannot be fixed yet as a final price, because of the unknown number of unlocked Stretch goals.\nAll calculations are based on volumetric weight for the different pledges. These are just estimates - costs may slightly rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals.  \nAdd-ons are subject to different treatment on our campaign, compared to pledges and stretch goals. We've decided to make it more user friendly and convenient for you and charge just $1 per unit. This flat rate system allows us to set up easier our pledge manager system and is more comfortable for you to calculate. Just add +$1 per unit later through the pledge manager.\nIf you add extra games to your pledge the $1 shipping cost does not apply. The game box is big and heavy (about 2.5 kg each) so in this case we need to charge for than $1. One extra game box is not going to double the cost of the shipping, but it is going to increase the shipping cost by some percentage. The increase will be different according to your location and will depend on the number of unlocked stretch goals.\nPlease add NO SHIPPING COSTS NOW, no matter if for pledges or for add-ons!

But just take a look at our first campaign and the feedback after it and after delivery... I would say that nobody could complain about what we've shipped as a final product. Despites some small delivery difficulties in the horror \"just before Christmas period of the year\", everything else went well and on time. All backers received their products in less than 6 months after campaign's end. The game itself was produced in Germany covering highest manufacturing standards and the quality of all miniatures and materials is just awesome. \nAbout the gameplay you can read all over the internet, but here a short list with reviews and other worthy stuff on our home page: http://battalia.eu/reviews/ - it speaks for itself. \nI would add only that our average BGG rating for the basic game is about 8.0 (or more) since the beginning...\n\nOn one hand we are just a small company and this is our second Kickstarter project, but on the other we have been publishing board games for the past six years now. We are cooperating with more than 30 famous publishers like FFG, KOSMOS, Hans im Glueck, AMIGO, IELLO and others. During this time we have published Bulgarian localized editions of many worldwide popular board games such as \u201cGame Of Thrones: The Board Game\u201d, \u201cSid Meier\u2019s Civilization\u201d, \u201cThe Legends Of Andor\u201d, \u201cUbongo\u201d, \u201cCarcassonne\u201d, \u201cWizard\u201d, \u201cAtlantis\u201d, \u201c King Of Tokyo\u201d, etc\u2026 This means a lot of EXPERIENCE on our end! Our production sites are located mainly in Germany, US and China, so international logistics are not an obstacle for us and meanwhile we know very well how to play the \u201cbig game\u201d called PUBLISHING. \nPlease note: the estimated delivery date is June 2017, but please keep in mind that this is only an informed guess. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We will do our best to minimize this as much as possible, but if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all, we are always ready to refund pledges in full. \nOf course, there are risks with every project, but we hope that our track record in publishing and our commitment to do everything as good as possible will gain your trust in us.\nProduction shipping or customs delays are always possible, but since our game is 90% complete, a small delay is probably the worst thing that could occur on this project. The most sophisticated part of our project is probably the production of the Battalia heroes and NPCs. Yes, exactly \u2013 these large and beautiful, but really complicated for production figurines. They are expensive, the process takes a lot of time and commitment, but the result is really worth the effort. To ensure a smooth and accurate production and delivery, we are cooperating with an old partner who is among the best production factories in Germany - a renown specialist in the board game field with really high quality standards for everything they produce \u2013 miniatures, game material, game board, boxes and so on\u2026. They produce also for CMoN and many other renown publishers. This should put everyone's minds at ease, regarding quality and delivery schedule! \nWe have no reason to expect that something could go terribly wrong, but in case that this happens, please check our refund policy.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, charges included, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. After this period a refund without any explanation is still possible, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and Stripe payment processing fees (as we will not be refunded by them after this 60 day period). \nHowever, once we\u2019ve begun packaging and preparing your rewards for shipment (usually 8 weeks before the actual shipping date), refunds are no longer possible. This means that we will reject any refunds after end of March 2017. \nImportant: If a game or component cannot be delivered at all (which is very unlikely), at your wish we will refund you the full amount, including fees, or we will try to work with you per e-mail and find a satisfactory solution for your individual case. \nPlease note: All refunds requested during the original 60 day period are returned to your credit card via Stripe. Refunds requested after this period will be processed via PayPal only!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "STORMGATES Pledge", "descp": "BIG!Expansion / Retail Value - $50\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15\nBG: free pick up or $3\nRest of the World : $15-$20\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["189 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Early CREATION Pledge", "descp": "**** Happy 48 Hour Special ****\nBasic Game - CEdition / Retail Value - $70\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15\nBG: free pick up or $3\nRest of the World : $15-$20\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers", "Limited (2 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "CREATION Pledge", "descp": "Basic Game - CEdition / Retail Value - $70\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping:\nUS & CA & EU : $10-$15\nBG: free pick up or $3\nRest of the World : $15-$20\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "COMBO Pledge:", "descp": "Basic Game + BIG!Expansion - CEditions /\nRetail Value - $120\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $20-$25 / EU : $15 -$20\nBG: free pick up or $5\nRest of the World : $25-$30\nINCLUDES:\nBATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\nBATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n+ All unlocked stretch goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["448 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "NEW COHORT Pledge", "descp": "6 BIG!Expansions / Retail Value - $300\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25\nBG: free pick up or $8\nRest of the World : $60-$90\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n6\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 300 or more", "title": "MIX COHORT Pledge", "descp": "3 Basic games + 3 BIG!Expansions /\nRetail Value - $360\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25\nBG: free pick up or $8\nRest of the World : $60-$90\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n3\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Stormgates CEdition\n3\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals!\n3\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 360 or more", "title": "OLD COHORT Pledge", "descp": "6 Basic Games - CEdition / Retail Value - $420\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends\n(see Shipping section for full details).\n** General reference point for shipping*:\nUS & CA : $50-$60 / EU : $15 -$25\nBG: free pick up or $8\nRest of the World : $60-$90\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 BATTALIA: The Creation CEdition\n6\u00d7 + All unlocked stretch goals marked as INDEPENDENT!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "SMUGGLER Pledge", "descp": "!

The game features traditional turn-based combat with a little bit of spice but will primarily focus on the story and how you change it. This will be done through the ESSENCE SYSTEM, which will track a player's personality and morality. After a glitch appears in the world of SOREN, our unexpected hero, Gus, will become aware of you- the player. Experience fourth wall breaking shenanigans while making decisions that will shape this world. \nWe are funded!\nThanks to all of our backers! GLITCHED is now funded and will begin development as soon as the Kickstarter is over! \nIf you cannot back through Kickstarter, use our Paypal to pre-order GLITCHED. You'll be able to pre-order GLITCHED for $10 and have the option for a few of our backer rewards as well. This will go down once our Kickstarter campaign is over! But be aware that any money given via Paypal will not reflect on the Kickstarter page total.\nIf you haven't backed us yet, check out our stretch goals to help add content to GLITCHED! \n   GLITCHED is being developed by En House Studios, a Chicago-based game dev team. Instead of wasting your time reading this introduction paragraph, you could be playing a demo of GLITCHED now.\n(Like right now.)\n     NOTE: This is a demo prototype of the game. It reflects an early development cycle and you can expect changes and improvements to a final version. This version will have some bugs which we will work to fix as soon as possible. We recommend 2 GB of free ram in order to run GLITCHED. A Linux version will be available for the final release only, sorry!\n  The small town of BETWIXT sits far removed from the events of the rest of the world and has always been home to GUS, our unlikely hero. \nThings remained ever constant until one day his best friend, CONRAD, told him he was going to leave for strange reasons.\nOn the night before CONRAD departs, an unexplained phenomenon, the glitch, seemingly erases his existence from the world. After coming face to face with the glitch, GUS is able to interact and speak to you- the player of GLITCHED. The traumatic event of suddenly losing his friend significantly affects GUS, but luckily you\u2019ll be there to guide him through.\nTogether, you and GUS will explore the world of SOREN and discover the truth behind it all. Each choice you make might influence who decides to be your friend or foe   \nYou\u2019ll travel from crowded cities to ancient kingdoms. Remnants and tales of the past will lead you to the answers of the present.\nYou're bound to meet plenty of strange characters on your journey. Some will be friends and other foes- perhaps that choice is left up to you.\n  At its core, GLITCHED is a story driven RPG where the player is constantly making decisions that have an impact of the world of SOREN. \nIn GLITCHED, the ESSENCE SYSTEM will track a player's choices and shape their personality and morality. This system will give each player a unique experience. \nBy exploring the world in your own way, you\u2019ll generate points towards six different ESSENCE alignments. \nThese alignments serve as personality types which will impact characters, story and the world around you. Your interaction with NPCs, how you explore the environment, combat, and even your conversations with GUS will determine your ESSENCE.   \nEach ESSENCE focuses on certain character traits and ideologies. No ESSENCE is good or evil, but instead explains the reasons behind your actions. Through meeting and talking to different NPCs, you\u2019ll get a better idea of what each ESSENCE is about. \n  GLITCHED uses traditional turn based combat with a few twists:\nThere is no leveling or random monster encounters.\nAll combat is story based and players will be making choices that may or may not lead to a brawl.\nLeveling up and experience are also removed. \nPlayers will have to use different party members and equipment in order to change how they approach each battle.\nDeciding to kill, spare, or find another way to stop a fight will all lead to different story outcomes.\nActions in battle are limited to three types: Fighting, Interacting, & Goodies. When enemies cannot fight anymore you'll be able to choose to kill or spare them which will alter the story. \nYou might also choose to interact with your enemy to resolve the conflict in a different way . Lastly, you'll be able to use items in battle to bring about various effects.\nCheck out our stretch goals section to see possible additions to the features of GLITCHED. There are plenty of things to be added, but prioritizing main game play features in the demo means smaller additions did not find their way in.\n  The soundtrack for GLITCHED features music composed by our very own Justin Hilton. Our friend Stijn Van Wakeren also composed a few songs and produced all of the tracks for the demo. Check out more of his work here. Visit the GLITCHED Soundcloud for more tracks here or check out the Band Camp to purchase some of the songs here.\n                                                               Forget Me Not\n                                                                  Kinda Lost\n                                                            Slick Like Green Skin\n                                                     Composed by Stijn Van Wakeren\n                                                                  Safe & Sound\n                                   We kept backer rewards as simple as possible. Each tier includes all previous rewards. The early bird special includes the full game, the soundtrack, and the dev book for $10 but is only for the first 75 backers.\n                                          \u22c6 STRETCH GOALS \u22c6\n  Customize a hub town! You\u2019ll be able to pick and choose the layout, buildings, and residents. A quiet (or noisy) place for you and your friends to kick back.\nBebo's are our lovable flightless birds. As a species, they are quite infatuated with Gus. As you traverse the world, you\u2019ll run into all different sorts of them. As any good RPG would have you do: it\u2019s time to collect them all.\nPut your number crunching to the test against a series of turn based combat trials. You\u2019ll be able to build an arcade in your hub town which will include boss rush modes, new game play, and more.\nOur pixel portraits for each character could use a little love, and with this stretch goal you\u2019ll get two upgrades for the price of one. First, each character will get a nice little talking animation to go along with their speech. Second, each character will get a full sheet of emotions to help bring conversations to life just a bit more. \nLet\u2019s get those enemy sprites movin\u2019 and groovin\u2019. With this stretch goal we\u2019ll add enemy animations along with some animation to the character cards for your allies. Making the battles just a bit more lively might help during some of those longer encounters.\nThis stretch goal will encompass quite a lot of content. We can\u2019t give away too many details about additions to the game, but you can expect more hours of game play at this stretch goal. This will add things like new places to explore, new quests and characters, new equipment, and more branching stories. At this funding level, we\u2019ll be able to create our \u2018dream game\u2019 without leaving content out that we really wished to see in the full release.\nGLITCHED already has tons of replay-ability with the Essence System, but with New Game+ you will challenge tougher enemies, uncover hidden secrets, and more to reward players who want to experience everything. More details will come once it's unlocked! \nThe friendship system will allow your party members to interact with one another. They will gain points being in the party together and learn tag skills in battle. More character backstory and cool skills await with the friendship system!\nNew quests and characters come along with the day and night system. You'll be able to wait or use an inn to cycle the time of day. Different quests and characters will be available during different parts of the day. More secrets and complex quests!\nPlay GLITCHED on PS Vita! All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nPlay GLITCHED on PS3 and PS4!

All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on.\nWith this stretch goal, all backers will receive free additional content after release.

All $10+ backers will get a choice of which platform they would like to receive their copy of GLITCHED on. \nEn House Studios is a Chicago based game dev team. While the team is small, we are completely dedicated to this project. Through the demo, we hope to showcase our ability to fully develop GLITCHED. En House Studios LLC is an established limited liability company. \nAll funds earned through Kickstarter will be put directly into the company and go towards the development of GLITCHED. Funding allocation can be seen below in the money section.\nTUMBLR | TWITTER | FACEBOOK | RPGMaker.net | Itch.io | Press Kit | Steam GREENLIGHT\n    ZACK - Programmer  |  JUSTIN - Composer & Designer | NIKKO - Lead Designer & Artist \nOur friends:\nAnthony Luna (Enemy/Faces Pixel Art) \nStijn Van Wakeren (Soundtrack Production) \nLou H.\nIf you have any questions, get in contact with us through Kickstarter or social media. We\u2019ll make a video of us answering questions we get!\n  Let\u2019s talk cash. The reason we are here on Kickstarter is because we need more than our personal funds to fully develop GLITCHED. Above, you\u2019ll see the breakdown plan of our spending. A sizable chunk will go to backer rewards. Our development costs can be seen by adding art, soundtrack, licensing, and graphic design together. These all add up to fifty percent of the total. Art will go towards paying our pixel artists and promotional artists. Soundtrack will go towards producing our compositions. Kickstarter fees and taxes will take about ten percent. What\u2019s left will be spent on promotion which gets us to our full budget.   \nThis budget changes in the event that we earn more than our asking amount. We\u2019ll update this little pie chart if that does happen to keep you informed on where your money will be going. We wish to be transparent on how we will use these funds and will answer ANY possible question you have about spending. We take development costs very seriously and believe open communication is important to crowdfunding.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter is a risk. What we have tried to do is showcase not only our serious dedication to the project, but also that we have the skills, means, and environment to develop GLITCHED. We hope that our Kickstarter and demo has provided you enough confidence to consider backing us.\n\nWith that said, game development has its risks. There are everyday risks such as health, family, and life issues that might happen to anyone. Development risks are where most problems arise. For us, this means extended deadlines, delayed development, or the feared \"running out of funds.\" We have taken a look at the necessities for GLITCHED and have carefully based our budget around that. With more money behind the project comes more security, content, and quality. Our main goal is to deliver GLITCHED. We have estimated a release date of February 2018 but the stated risks could possibly change that.\n\nWe have laid out our case in this Kickstarter. We have the ability to produce GLITCHED and our demo shows a taste of what the final product will look like. We hope you understand the risks that might happen down the road but also take a look at what we have done to earn your trust in us. We believe greatly in transparency and there will be nothing that happens in development which we don't relay to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You", "descp": "Our thanks & a tiny place in our hearts.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Full Game", "descp": "Digital download of GLITCHED upon release.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["1,841 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Soundtrack", "descp": "Digital download of the soundtrack for GLITCHED.

There is a huge world to explore here! \nWhen playing campaign mode, all stories are linked to a location on the map. You'll see something intriguing on the map, travel to that location, and read a story to find out what is there.\nIf you play story mode, you pick one character and play through a focused, connected story line over 4+ games. Early choices you make affect later outcomes in the story! Each character features multiple story paths and endings.\n    Retail Version: The standard retail version of Near and Far will have an MSRP of $59.99.

Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games.

So it's fresh and new to our world of open creativity. The creator of Peter Pan, J M Barrie also inspired us. When he passed away in 1929, he gave all the rights to Peter Pan to Great Ormond Street Hospital in the UK. GOSH (Great Ormond Street Hospital) grew and survived in part by the funds Peter Pan's play and book rights brought in for decades. As such, team Lynnvander is donating 5% of this Kickstarter (post fees) to GOSH!\n  Having a legacy doesn't mean having to grow up! Travel to Neverland with Peter Pan and his allies in the third epic installment in the Legacy series! Neverland's Legacy is set in the same universe as Albion's Legacy and Sherwood's Legacy but is a totally stand-alone game that doesn't require the other Legacy games to play.\nIn this strategic, dice-rolling skirmish game, you help either Peter Pan and his allies or Captain Hook and his crew to assault their rivals on Hook's pirate ship or in the lost boys' camp respectively. At the start of the game, you'll choose which faction to play as and then set up the appropriate location to attack. Whether you're playing as Peter and his allies or Hook and his crew, you'll then assault your foes' base of operations, drawing cards to search every nook and cranny for lost boys, fairies, and pirate treasure, while positioning yourselves around the board to bypass or fight off your enemies. As your foes cause you to fall into despair, you are forced to roll Stones of Chance instead of choosing your actions, making it more difficult to take optimal turns.\nAs Peter and his allies, the game is won when you rescue all of the lost boys aboard Hook's ship. As Captain Hook and his crew, the game is won when you capture all of the lost boys hiding in their camp. In either case, the game is lost when your foes defeat enough of your characters! Neverland's Legacy is an immersive, highly thematic game that carries on the Legacy series's focus on super challenging co-op games.\n  This game includes!\n  You can read a preview version of the rulebook at the following link:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/g6xmabugh0woz25/NeverlandsRulebook_KSpreview1.pdf?dl=0\nAlbion's Legacy Rules PDF - https://www.dropbox.com/s/6g7y7u94afngjyq/Albions%20Rules%20V2.pdf?dl=0\nSherwood's Legacy Rough Rules PDF - https://www.dropbox.com/s/qx7bjc8b5w5rdep/SherwoodsRules.pdf?dl=0\n Here's a few rounds of each game for you to compare\nNeverland's Legacy Play Through\nAlbion's Legacy Play Through\nSherwood's Legacy Play Through\n  To add to your Neverland experience we've created a Kickstarter exclusive expansion.

Below are a few titles you can expect to see in the coming 2016 and 2017 Lynnvander/Jasco release year. We'll take you from Feudal Japan all the way to the depths of Atlantis, whether riding a Chandelier as a Musketeer or sizing a French Castle as Joan of Arc, there will be something for everyone.\nFuture developed Legacy games\nEach Kickstarter will focus on the newest family member to the Legacy series, however, we will always open up exclusive content for previous Legacy games. This content will only be available through Kickstarter. Below are our first two Legacy games. \nAlbion's Legacy - Our first Legacy game! \nAlbion's Legacy is a a fully cooperative modular-adventure game for 1-4 players (expandable to 6).  In Albion's Legacy, King Arthur and his allies explore Albion in search of specific Realms, while trying to collect enough Quest Coins to win the game! As the Realms are explored, various Enemies will stand in the way, and must be Challenged by rolling the Stones of Chance! Meanwhile, Despair threatens the land! If the Flames of Hope are extinguished, or all Virtue is lost, the kingdom falls!

These avatars work perfectly with your Kickstarter Profiles. \n    Lynnvander Studios is a Southern Ontario based game design company focusing on the creation of board games from concept to deliverable files. Our work for major publishers in the industry includes the design of Buffy the Vampire Slayer: the Board Game, and Galaxy Quest: the Board Game.\nWe use Kickstarter because we love the community that's formed around our past campaigns and because, with your help, we can make games that we never would have been able to manufacture on our own, and we can make games that are bigger and better than would have been possible without your support. With that in mind, we've got an aggressive Kickstarter lineup planned for the coming year so get ready for a whole lot of new games!\nThe Legacy line is exclusively published and distributed through our amazing partners at Jasco Games.\n  Many companies use Kickstarter as a sort of preorder system for moving finished products - that\u2019s not us. We\u2019re a small team of 6 game designers, most of which are part time. We\u2019d like for most of our team to be full time but we\u2019re still building up to that and making our place in the industry. We\u2019ve been very lucky to build relationships with other companies that have allowed us to work on big licensed properties but our original properties are still a passion for us. That\u2019s why we\u2019re forging ahead with our line of Legacy games. With your support, we were able to manufacture Albion\u2019s Legacy, send it out to tons of backers, and bring it to retail. You\u2019ve also allowed us to create Sherwood\u2019s Legacy and Deep 5 which are in manufacturing now.\nAs you may know, we were appalled by the production issues and poor quality of the 1st edition of Albion\u2019s Legacy and, with your support, we were able to reprint Albion\u2019s Legacy through a new manufacturer, and send an improved copy of the game to all of our original backers for free. Despite tons of amazing backers helping to cover the costs of the 2nd edition of Albion\u2019s Legacy through our micro-kickstarter, this created a huge financial expense for us that we\u2019re still recovering from as a company. That\u2019s a very real reason why Kickstarter is still crucial for us to create new games. Plus, we love bringing the Legacy series to Kickstarter, and interacting with all of you along the way. With your help, we're going to make Neverland's Legacy way more awesome than we could have on our own.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign, based on the actual cost to ship your pledge reward to your location. We will not charge any handling fees above the actual cost to ship your game.\nThrough our strategic partnerships, we have arranged fulfillment options in multiple countries, significantly reducing your shipping costs. We will be shipping from locations in the United States, Canada, and the UK, saving you the cost of customs and VAT fees.\nPlease Note* Shipping to Military bases can be costly. Message us for details.\nSince Albion's Legacy has already been funded and fulfilled once, your copy will ship within 2-4 weeks of this campaign ending. You'll have the option to hold your game and wait for Neverland's OR ship it immediately. Sherwood's Legacy is still in manufacturing stages and is set to ship by the end of the summer. You may also elect to ship Sherwood's sooner or not.\nAll mini's and bonus content will released at the same time as Neverland's Legacy with exception to GripMats which in the case of Albion's and Sherwood's, may ship immediately.\nPlease Note* We open to any shipping options you can work out with us. We want to get these products in your hands as quickly and least expensive as possible. Contact us with any inquiry and we'll respond asap.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've come a long way and have learned a lot about Kickstarter and game manufacturing in general but challenges still come up.\n\nOur first game, Albion's Legacy, was a good game but very poorly manufactured. In response to the poor quality of our first product, we've reprinted the game and given the reprint to our original backers for free. While this commitment to quality is important to us, it's caused significant delays and pushed fulfillment of our other games back. With a better understanding of the industry, and the help of a great manufacturer, Deep 5, and Sherwood's Legacy are well on their way to being fulfilled. With nothing left for us to do but wait for manufacturing to be concluded, and ship out the remaining games, it's time for our team to get back to what we're best at: making new games.\n\nWe're confident that this campaign will be a smooth process but delays can happen. Sometimes the art takes longer to complete than we'd expected. Others, shipping or customs hit us with surprise delays. Whatever happens, we'll communicate with you honestly and openly and do everything that we can to provide you with a high quality game.\n\nRisks of workload, shipping, customs, art delays etc. But promises on making this game a reality.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "KENSINGTON KID", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

Thank you very much!!!\nThe late pledging via PayPal will be open until the end of summer 2016.

You may also send us an e-mail to moroz@morozpublishing.com\nIn a few months after the campaign all these awesome towers will become available at the Rightgames online store. Please note that shipping will cost more as we cover 1/2 shipping expenses during the campaign, and there will be no Kickstarter exclusive First Player tokens and additional free dice bags (of course!).\nLET THE DICE ROLL!\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nLoad dice, then push down on the stylish lever. BANG! Random results guaranteed, along with a privilege to use dice towers that you won\u2019t find anywhere else!\nWe are proud to present the Orc Totem and the White Castle \u2014 dice towers with a rotating platform. Unlike ordinary towers, you don\u2019t throw your dice inside. Rather, you place them on a special platform, and let them loose with a special lever.\nIn addition, we\u2019ve created MDT-7 \u2014 a compact collapsible dice tower. This one easily fits in your bag and takes just a few seconds to fold out!\nDice towers come with awesome First Player tokens, created specifically for this Kickstarter campaign! Each of the three tokens accompanies its own dice tower.\nThe approximate value of each of these First Player tokens is $6. They won\u2019t be available for separate sale.\nHere is the deal: only now on Kickstarter, you get your First Player token for free with the appropriate tower!\nAnd even more! We give away a red velvet dice bag with each dice tower your purchase. Just for free!\n  The Orc Totem is the original dice tower. Everything started with it. We exhibited it at Essen last year, and were surprised with unbelievable feedback we got. A dozen test copies that we brought to Essen vanished before the end of the first day. It was incredible!  \nMany people stopped near our booth just to see how the tower works. It\u2019s really fun to watch! You place dice on top, press on the mushroom, and as the totem orc rolls his eyes fearfully, the dice tumble down. Not for the faint hearted!\nThe turning platform of the Orc Totem works for small and medium dice. You can also throw dice through the mouth of the daemon on the back. This way you can roll even the biggest and the baddest of your dice! A wooden fence keeps the dice from rolling too far.\n  The White Castle is absolutely amazing. First of all, it's huge! When you set it on the table, no matter what board game you play \u2014 everything becomes just... epic!\nThe Castle comes to life when you press the tiny turret on the top. Click! The dice start their thundering journey through the depths of the tower. The Castle\u2019s portcullis is lifted, and a medieval king, a queen, a knight and a minstrel appear in the gothic windows.\nAll our dice towers are covered with gorgeous laser engravings. However the White Castle stands in a league of its own. It is decorated with masonry, winches, hoists, and more. Furthermore, it\u2019s laminated with white plastic. Enough words \u2014 just take a look at this beauty!\n  Now for our little baby. MDT-7 is a collapsible tower that can be folded and unfolded in a few simple moves! Two or three seconds \u2014 and your dice have a place to roll!\nMDT-7 doesn\u2019t have a special dice throwing mechanism, as per the Orc Totem and the White Castle. Rather, MDT-7 is designed for portability. It is perfect for board-game parties when you need a dice tower, but don\u2019t want to be lugging around too much stuff.\nOne more thing. Does the folded MDT-7 remind you of anything? A Warhammer 40k tank, you say? Well, if that\u2019s how it is\u2026 Enemy sighted \u2014 ready the dice! Give \u2018em a round of d6! Load the armor-piercing d20!\nOur towers are all built of HDF \u2014 high-density fiberboard. It\u2019s famed for its strength and durability. If you\u2019re not planning to smash your tower with a hammer, sit on it, incinerate it (which isn\u2019t even all that easy to do!) or any other such nasty things \u2014 the tower will serve you for many years!\nTactilely, HDF is quite pleasant. The surface is smooth and flat. All towers are made with a laser, so the edges are free from burrs.\nAll parts fit each other perfectly. Assembling these towers is a piece of cake. As for gluing, it is not necessary at all. However if you wish to glue all the parts together, most common glues like PVA will be okay.\nRich laser engravings are applied to each of the towers. The towers look amazing as they are! Still, you are free to paint them if you want. Though preferably the Orc Totem and MDT-7, the White Castle has been painstakingly laminated.\nMore about painting in our update.\nThe Orc Totem, White Castle and MDT-7 are shipped in HDF punchboards. This is how it looks:\nYou will need to carefully press out the tower pieces. This procedure is simple and takes only a few minutes.\nEach tower supplied with detailed instructions:\nNote. If you order only the Orc Totem, it will arrive to you without the punchboard. We press out all the pieces for you in advance. This is done in order to reduce the shipping cost. Not all that important, but we prefer to make the things clear!\nIn addition to dice towers, we offer high-quality bags for your dice!\nThere are 2 different sets available: the Black and White set for $18 and the Multicolor set for $24. Each set includes 3 bags with either black-and-white or color pictures. Every picture in each set is dedicated to its own tower!\nThe bags are made from 100% linen. It\u2019s probably the best possible material to store dice and tokens. Such bags are smooth to the touch, well-ventilated, and durable. And they are washable, of course. Pictures won\u2019t wash out!\nCrafting. The picture is printed on the fabric with a special printer. Then it\u2019s finished with a thermal press. Only then the bag is sewed on the mechanical frame. This is not a high-volume manufacturing. This is true piece work!  \nHow to: To purchase bags, press \u2018MANAGE\u2019 on the top of the page, then select \u2018Change your pledge\u2019, add the cost of chosen bag sets in the \u2018PLEDGE AMOUNT\u2019 field and confirm the new amount.\nYou can read about these nice linen dice bags in more detail in this update!\nWe put all our love and expertise into our dice towers. Hence, we have no stretch goals like \"when we collect X money \u2014 we add something to the tower\". All that we wanted to do has already been done.\nHowever, if funding from this campaign exceeds our expectations (which are, by the way, a secret =), we promise to give you something exclusive and very special. We still have a couple of cool ideas, and perhaps you\u2019ll be able to help bring them to life!\nThe first such idea has come to life already. We are happy to add a free red velvet dice bag to every tower you purchase!\nNow every tower comes with a dice bag and an amazing First Player token. These are not stretch goals, but just free presents from us! Our hearty gift to everyone backing us on Kickstarter!\n    The main things you want to know about shipping:\nKnowledge comes with a click! You will see the shipping cost by simply choosing a reward to the right of this page.\nOne for all! The shipping costs are the same, no matter the destination. The only difference is in the type and number of towers you order.\nMore is less! The more towers you order, the cheaper is shipping per tower!\nTax Free! We do not claim \u00abEU Friendly\u00bb and so on, but we are very close to it. In our case, there are no customs taxes for 99% of the known world. More details in FAQ section, at the bottom of this page.\nAt the ready! We will start making and sending towers about a month after the end of the campaign. We hope to ship the last tower in September. Many of you will receive your towers earlier than the estimated delivery date!\nYour choice. You are free to choose any combination of towers and calculate shipping by yourself. Read about it next!\nWe\u2019ve prepared multiple rewards for all the main options: any one of three towers, any two towers, three towers.\nHowever, you are free to choose whatever you like \u2014 for example, two Orc Totems and one MDT-7. This way you\u2019ll have to calculate the total sum yourself, following instructions below. (Or you can cry for help, and we\u2019ll be happy to do it for you!).\nFor custom selection of towers please choose the very first reward level, called \u201cFree choice\u201d.\nNext, calculate shipping costs:\n1. The Orc Totem and MDT-7 are counted as 1 unit. White Castle is counted as 2 units.\n2. Shipping of the first unit costs $8. Add $4 for each additional unit.\nExample #1. You decided to buy a White Castle (2 units) and two MDT-7 (1 unit each). Total: 4 units. Shipping of the first unit is $8. Shipping of the remaining three units is $4 per each. Final shipping: $8 + $4x3 = $20.\nExample #2. You decided to buy three Orc Totems (1 unit each) and two MDT-7 (1 unit each). Total: 5 units. Shipping of the first unit is $8. Shipping of the remaining four units is $4 per each. Final shipping: $8 + $4x4 = $24.\nAdd the costs of your chosen towers (MDT-7 = $14, Orc Totem = $20, White Castle = $35). Add the shipping cost as described above. Pledge your resulting amount, choosing the \u201cFree choice\u201d reward. Done!\nYou can also add up to 10 linen dice bag sets. Adding them does not affect the shipping cost.\nImportant! If you want to get 6 or more towers units, please contact us directly. Maybe we can give you an extra shipping discount!\nWe are based in Russia. Although our trips to Essen Fair give us an opportunity to exhibit dice towers to visitors, it\u2019s not enough.\nWe know how great these towers are! We are delighted with what we\u2019ve created, and our wish is to share them with the world. Kickstarter is the best chance we have to achieve this!\nFedor and Sergey are both involved in Rightgames company. It is one of the oldest in Russia in the board games industry. Fedor takes care of the company\u2019s general service activities, and Sergey is the executive producer and head of production.\nThe dice towers idea was originally born as a fan project. Long evenings spent with the laser cutter, drawings, guesstimates, experiments... In the end, it turned out into something really awesome!\nWe\u2019d like to add that towers project is carried out together with Moroz Publishing. Denis Davydov from Moroz is the one who answers all your comments and messages here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSergey Machin, the main responsible for the production in Rightgames, fears that lasers will attack him at night and burn orcish totemic symbols onto his back. That he won't be able to read, because its very inconvenient to read from your own back. That is what scares him.\n\nFedor Myachin, the creator of Orc Totem tower, worries that people will buy so many towers that he and his team will be cutting wood and packing shipments day and night. But Ivan Tulovskiy, the President of Rightgames, would be rather pleased with that outcome. He loves it when people are working!\n\nSeriously though, we have a lot of experience with laser cutter production. Our towers are crash tested. They were assembled, checked, disassembled, jumped on, hammered, punched, slapped, again assembled and still everything works as it should! We take pride in quality.\n\nRightgames has been producing and shipping board games and accessories for over 10 years. Of course, unforeseen circumstances can always arise.

By us sorting and packing everything in the USA, any shortages will be able to be identified while the coins are still in the factory. If this occurs this time, production of the \"short list\" can begin while the bulk of the coins start their journey on the ocean. Once complete, they will be shipped via Air and arrive approximately at the same time. We don't expect this to happen this year; however, if it does, we will be ready.\n\nVAT: We will be billed directly for customs and duty. Standard rates apply; however, discounts will be taken into account during calculation.\n\nInternational Shipping: We have worked out great deals for this years shipping; however, it can take a little longer to arrive (a few days) but is certainly cheaper than USPS. Dare we say we are EU Friendly?!\n\nPackaging: Bags inside of clamshells or bags inside of boxes which are inside of a box...we aren't taking any chances with how the postal system plays with the mail.
