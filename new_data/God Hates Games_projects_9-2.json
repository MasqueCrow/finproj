Even with great strides being made in the name of gender equality and numbers of women in the industry increasing, female game makers are still in a great minority and face amazing challenges in our otherwise inclusive field.\nAfter compiling stories and advice for years, Elisa decided to write a book on the matter, and there is no better way to discuss such important topics than to include many voices with important viewpoints on the subject.  So, we've gathered together some amazing contributors to each add a chapter on various game topics for a book that has never been see before!\nOur chapter topics include:\nAnecdotes or stories about being a woman in the game industry\nAdvice for women on overcoming challenges women face in this field\nAdvice for men on how to make inclusion a reality in our great industry\nGlass ceilings, male co-worker dealings, and general inequality of women in the field\nCreating balanced game design for both men and women\nWhy games are important for girls\nDealing with \"fake geek\" or \"real gamer\" comments when playing games (or just existing) in mixed company\nTwo words: Booth Babes.\nFemale representation in games\nBeing taken seriously as a professional in a male-dominated category\nTips on getting your foot in the door at a game company\nThe pros and cons of Games \"for girls\" \nand so much more!\nWho is this book for?\nGirls on Games is for everyone.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGirls on Games is actually a pretty straight-forward project, but it has the potential to grow very large, with possibility of many chapters being added to the book. As a project like this grows, there is the increasing possibility that the editing of each chapter or adding artwork will take longer than expected. \n\nWe have a set game-plan, however, with strict deadlines for contributors, and we have plenty of book design and printing experience behind us. Elisa recently did the graphic design on the extremely successful Maze of Games puzzle book), and laying everything out for print is much like an extremely huge instruction book (not that we'd ever recommend such a thing) or Role Playing Book. Plus, Elisa runs a magazine (Cupcake Quarterly) on the side, and the layout process is nearly identical.\n\nWe lack most of the risks associated with the types of Kickstarters we are used to (ahem, full games) because we have no components to source or a ton of artwork to produce, so our risk level is very low.\n\nWe currently have 3 options for printers/fulfillment all lined up and ready to go, and we will choose the one that makes most sense when we see how large the Kickstarter gets - which is all up to you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Books have been shipped from the printer!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "The PDF has been delivered, and an update on printing status!", "update_content": "Happy 4th of July Weekend, Backers!\nLast night, you all should have received an email from BackerKit (where you should have already filled out your survey) with a download link for the PDF of the book.

Win the round to get your hands on the most valuable loot, but beware! Just because you claimed the loot does not mean you get to keep it! Pirate Loot will come in a convenient 2-part box, holding all 108 cards you need to play and the rulebook. Inside you will find the following:\n23 Loot cards, from a crate of monkeys to a golden peg leg\n77 Draw cards, each one representing a pirate you can recruit. Each pirate belongs to one of four factions: brutal, clever, greedy, or lazy.\n4 rank cards, for breaking ties at the end of the round.\n4 ship cards, used to store your ill-gotten gains.\nA simple sheet explaining the rules of the game.\nPirate Loot can be played in as little as 20 minutes, but a full game should last about an hour. You can check out the complete rules below.\nPirate Loot is being produced by Minotaur Games. It is designed by Jason Bulmahn, a veteran of the gaming industry, with art by Scott Kurtz and Dylan Meconis and graphic design by Mari Kolkowsky.\nLearning to be a pirate is easy, but winning this cutthroat game will take both strategy and a bit of luck.\nEach player is dealt a hand of 5 draw cards, each one representing a pirate you can recruit to your ship. On your turn, you select one of these cards and put it into play next to your ship, then draw back up 5 cards. While every pirate has a value they add to your ship, some also have effects that trigger when they come into play, such as forcing other players to discard cards or even stealing loot. Some pirates also have effects that last as long as they are in play, granting you a lasting edge.\nPlay then proceeds to the next player until someone draws the \u201cSet Sail\u201d card. Once that card is revealed, each player gets one more turn before you figure out who gets the haul!\nOnce the ships have sailed, you compare your crew to determine who has the best crew on the high seas. That player gets the loot, but in games of 3 or more, other players might be able to claim a lesser prize as well! You then deal out the cards and keep playing until one player has claimed enough loot to satisfy their scurvy crew and become the pirate admiral.\nTo read the complete rules of the game and download them as a PDF, click this link!\nYou can also play download and play a 2-Person Demo of Pirate Loot!

That said, we are able to offer a few digital add-ons. To purchase any of these add-ons, simply click on \"manage my pledge\" once you are a backer and adjust your pledge by the amount listed for each add-on. DO NOT change your pledge level. Once the project concludes, we will sort out your digital add-ons through the backer surveys.\nA Round of Grog ($3): Say thanks to the team with a small tip. You'll get a digital photo of the team, thanking you for your generosity!\nDigital Basic Game Print-and-Play ($10): With this add-on, you'll get the digital print-and-play playtest version of the basic game (note, this is included at the Gunner Level and above).\nMinotaur PDFs ($10): Add this to get all 10 of the Minotaur Games Pathfinder-compatible PDFs, a $25 value (note, this is included at the Minotaur Gunner level).\nAlthough our most basic goal is to create an awesome game with good production values, we also have some exciting stretch goals to unlock to make this game even better!\nFunded ($16,000)\nAt $16,000 we will have the money to get the game printed and shipped. At this level, the game will have a light art approach, with each most cards in a suit sharing the same piece of art.\nStretch Goal #1: Full Art ($20,000)\nOnce we reach $20,000 we will be able to afford unique art for nearly every card in the deck. The only exception is for a small number of cards that are duplicated in the deck (where it is better to have the same art so that they are easily recognizable).\n Stretch Goal #2: Bonus Cards ($30,000)\nWe will print 6 bonus loot cards to add to your game. These will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above.These cards will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nStretch Goal #3: 6 Player Expansion ($40,000)\nIf we can raise $40,000 we unlock an entirely new deck of cards. This 55 card deck will include TWO entirely new suits of pirate to add to your game, allowing it to be played with up to 6 players! The first suit is UNDEAD pirates, allowing you to add a horde of shambling zombie pirates to your game. The second suit is SNEAKY pirates! These shadowy pirates let you flip some of your crew face-down, to keep the other captains guessing! This deck will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above.\nStretch Goal #4: Bonus Cards ($50,000)\nAt this level, we will add 6 bonus crew cards to the game. These will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above. These cards will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nStretch Goal #5: Challenge Deck ($60,000)\nThe high seas are a dangerous place and with this 54 card expansion deck, you can pit your crew against all manner of threats, from the King's Navy to the deadly Kraken! During the game, you can take on these challenges by getting a crew of sufficient strength, allowing you to claim the card and gain a bonus for the rest of the game! This deck will be added to every backer at the gunner level and above.\n Stretch Goal: 1,000 Backers!\nA horde of Pirates! If we can reach 1,000 backers for Pirate Loot, we will add 4 BONUS PIRATE CREW CARDS to every backer at the Gunner Level and above! If we also hit $40K and unlock the 6-Player Expansion Deck, this number will jump to 6 bonus cards! Each one of these cards will be called the HORDE and you will get one for each faction. These cards will be an exclusive to Kickstarter backers!\nBeyond the Horizon\nWho knows what hides beyond the horizon, but it is sure to be exciting!\nCosts\nCreating, printing, and shipping games is not cheap, but with your help, we can make a game that will be a treasured part of your library. Your pledge will make that happen and here is how. To fund the basic version of the game, we need $16,000. After the Kickstarter fees that leaves us with around $14,500. Here how the costs approximately break down:\n$5,000 \u2013 Art, layout, and design\n$6,000 \u2013 Printing\n$3,500 \u2013 Distribution and shipping\nThese budget ratios should hold up well beyond our initial funding goal. The cost to print a copy of each game will go down if we increase the size of our print run, but we expect those savings will be offset by the increased cost of shipping all those games to you!\nProcess\nOnce we hit our funding goal, the creation process will get underway as soon as possible. Art and design should take about three months total to get the game ready for print. This process might take a bit longer if we unlock the expansion decks and bonus cards. Once the files are completed, they can be shipped to our printer, who has already given us very competitive bids for the printing of the game and any bonuses. The printing and shipping process will take approximately four months. Assuming we do not get held up, our fulfillment partner, Card Kingdom, should be able to ship your game to you shortly thereafter.\nRetailers\nWe know that retailers are a vital part in supporting any game and we want to make sure that Pirate Loot can become an attractive part of your store's offerings. We plan to make Pirate Loot available through the common distribution channels (ACD, Alliance, Diamond, etc).

Thank You!\nSee Update #12 for more info!\nUnlocked: Everyone who pledged $19+ gets a FREE Print and Play of \"Santa's Summer Break\", the kids game by Jason Kotarski that inspired Fidelitas.\nSee update #10 for more info!\nUnlocked: The $32K funding level every backer who pledged at the $19+ levels will get 2 new promos!\n This time, we're adding a couple Missio cards, new goals to add some variety by transforming the Tavern locations into opportunities for scoring! The Barkeep isn't a part of a Guild so there is no Virtus Card for this character. But crafty folks in the city can gain his trust by keeping his bar stool filled with thirsty patrons. And you can hold sway over the Tavern by making sure it's standing room only!\nLike the other promos, these cards will initially only be made available through this Kickstarter until a future time when they may become available at conventions or through other outlets. But before all that, they are for you first! Let's make the last few days count! Please keep sharing the project far and wide!\nSee update #8 for more info!\nUnlocked: The Party Pack Promos will now include 5 cards with two new versions of The Chiseler and The Herald with art by Jaqcui Davis! And the photo cards will still be included, too!\nThe Bloody Butcher removes 3 cards to the discard pile and will probably give you nightmares! The Chiseler looks vaguely familiar and will chisel away at other player's hands. And The Heralds? They must be some sort of messengers, gathering lots of folks at the Tavern to share the latest news and get new information flowing. The one on the right sure is handsome!\nLike the Candlestick Maker Promos, these promo cards will not be included in the retail version and will initially will only be made available to Kickstarter backers. To be clear, this is not a Kickstarter Exclusive as these cards may be made available in the future at conventions or through other channels but not for a while.\nSee Update #6 for more info!\nUnlocked! All backers at the $19+ tiers will receive the Candlestick Maker Promo Cards; a new Virtus Card and a new Missio Card! \nThese promo cards will not be included in the retail version and will initially will only be made available to Kickstarter backers. To be clear, this is not a Kickstarter Exclusive as these cards may be made available in the future at conventions or through other channels but not for a while.\nSee update #5 for more info!\nUnlocked- Every copy of the production version of the game will come with a Wooden Start Player marker. \nWhile we don't have the final art yet, it will look a little something like that grey shield pictured above. This marker will be given to the first player so that when ever the game end is triggered all others players are given one more turn to prove their worthiness in the cause against the corrupt crown!\nUnlocked- We have great playtesters and backers and we heard your request loud and clear! Some of the Virtus Cards refer to the \"Castle\" and \"Harbor\" locations which are indicated on the locations cards by small signs pointing to the space next to the play area. For some people these signs were difficult to see and keep track of so we've decided to add two new cards to Fidelitas that can be placed to help these locations to be more clear. While players won't actually play to these locations but rather at locations next to these cards, we thought it would be helpful to make them stand out a bit more than they do in the current format. See the variant possible with these new cards herehttp://www.phantasiogames.net/2014/08/fidelitas-stretch-goal-2.html. This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include these cards right in the box!\n\nUnlocked- Meet the Brute, the Commander, the Scribe, and the Monk! Manu Forti is Latin for \"with a strong hand\" and these cards add new actions, new missions, new members of the least represented Guilds, and new ways to score. These new Virtus Cards can be played as an action or scored by gathering specific types of cards into your hand! These advanced cards provide an added layer that sows confusion and mistrust while providing another route to gain points that pave the way to victory as the leader of the revolution! This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include this expansion right in the box!\nIn Fidelitas, players take on the role of faithful citizens in a medieval city exerting influence in order to gain the credibility needed to lead the charge against the corrupt crown. Players play character cards to various locations that make up the city in order to meet conditions of hidden objectives. Each type of character card is associated with a unique action that manipulates cards in the game; use the Butcher to bully other characters to new locations, use the Student to gain more cards, use the Soldier to keep the peasants from loitering too long.\nIn this game where keen maneuvering is key, attentiveness to the opposition may uncover hidden motives that seek to foil your bid for power. The first player to gain a certain number points depending on the number of players is determined worthy to lead the revolt, and also wins the game.\nFidelitas is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up and plays in 20-30 minutes. The game is designed by Jason Kotarski (The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and Philip duBarry (Revolution!, Courtier, Canalis, Kingdom of Solomon).\nWatch Rahdo's Gameplay Runthrough here:\nWelcome to Fidelitas! In a city you\u2019ve never heard of that\u2019s far too difficult to locate on a map, during a time long before you or anyone you know were born, a cohort of faithful citizens gathered to put plans in motion to take the power back from the political elite whose so-called \u201cleadership\u201d led to nothing more than inequity and discontent among the people. But instead of formulating a plan for revolution, they drank too much ale and forgot what they were gathering for in the first place.\nBut thanks to their digression, now it\u2019s your turn to pick up where they left off\u2026before the over-indulgence, of course!\nPhoto by Scott King (ScottKing.info)\nFidelitas is a card game with a small footprint that packs a big punch!\nFidelitas will include:\n50 Virtus Cards (characters)\n20 Missio Cards (hidden goals)\n5 Location Cards \nFull-color rulesheet with illustrations and examples\nAll this will fit in a small, rigid two-part box for maximum portability!

The low price point of this game should keep these charges to a minimum.\nJason Kotarski and Philip duBarry are game designers from the Midwest who met on the internet. They thought it would be cool to work on a game together. Neither of these stand-up-fellas had ever designed a game in collaboration with another designer before. And even though it can be difficult to give up some control in order work with another human being, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They probably learned something in the process. It may have even been kinda fun. Fidelitas is the result of more than a year of emailing, developing, and playtesting. They'd love it if you'd pledge your support for the fruit of their labors.\nJaqui Davis is an illustrator from the U.K. who's done beautiful work in the tabletop game space that includes contributions to: Belle of the Ball, Euphoria, Epic Resort, and Skyway Robbery.\nDarrell Louder is a graphic designer living in Delaware.

You and your backstabbing pals can only carry so much stuff, yet you will need certain treasures, tools, and weapons to survive a absurd menagerie of monsters, traps, and puzzles. For example, Party Orcs can be defeated with either weapons or a barrel of brandy, while the Monster That Can Only Be Defeated By Flaming Arrows can only be defeated by... uh... flaming arrows.\nThis game will be illustrated by the fantastic Nikki Burch, who did the art for our first kickstarter, Three Days Until Retirement. A print run of Beasts of Burden will feature 112 high-gloss playing cards each with it's own unique, hilarious illustration by Nikki.  \nEach player has a hand of 7 cards, drawn from the deck. There are three categories of cards, Items, Encounters and Effects. \n Item Cards: You can play weapon, tool, treasure and container cards in front of you, symbolizing all the stuff you are carrying around as you adventure. You can discard these during your turn, as well as play them - which is important, because you can only carry 10 weight at any given time.  \nEncounter Cards: Monster, quest and puzzle cards are played in a 3x3 grid in the center of the table. Any player can defeat these cards, provided they have the correct item cards in front of them. Encounter cards are worth points, and the person with the most points after one of the four quests has been completed wins.  \nSounds simple, right? Not so fast... \nTraps are a special kind of encounter card that you can play on your unsuspecting buddies. So if some jerk plays \"Many Alligators\" in front of you, you better stock up on weapons or be willing to sacrifice a sack full of kittens. \nEffect Cards: Things like curses, spells, hangovers, and clumsy accidents can increase or decrease your ability to handle all your stuff. They can also give you great satisfaction as you play them on others and have a reason to yell things like \"I CURSE YOU WITH TINY LEGS!\"\nAn incredible crew of people have helped me create and play-test Beasts of Burden. We believe that games and real-time creative social interactions are deeply rewarding and important to our lives and communities. I'm so excited to share this game with you and hope that you'll support independent publishing and game design. Beast of Burden was made with pride in St. Louis, MO. Help us get this card game printed!\nAll reward tiers come with an instant (well, as soon as I get around to sending it to you, which will usually be within a couple hours) download of the beta rules of the game, along with explanations on how to make the game yourself!\nI added HELLA TIERS to this because I know international shipping rates suck and I want to help out by setting things up to make group buys easy.  If you're non-international you can abuse my generosity by also organizing group buys.  I give zero shits!\nAre you a game shop?  You rule!  You should also order the big packages and stock my game on the CHEAP!

I'll cover my own travel costs because WHATEVER.\nThe tabletop gaming community on kickstarter is absolutely fantastic and getting to talk to backers and listen to their thoughts and feedback is so rad! As mentioned above, I ran akickstarterfor Dioxin Dump's first game,Three Days Until Retirementand I know for a FACT that the game came out much better because of the campaign.  Talking with backers allowed me to refine the rules, answer questions I hadn't thought of and further shape the look and feel of the product into the fantastic game it is today.\nPlus, the kickstarter campaign allowed me to greatly expand the print, editing and art budget for the game, producing wonderful full-color cover, expansion content, dozens of interior illustrations and a full edit job. Now Dioxin Dump isn't just a dream company that I started while avoiding work, it's a tiny-but-growing game company with a line of published products!  All thanks to backers like you!\nCould I make this game without kickstarter?  Maybe, if I wanted to run into credit card debt and print only a few copies for friends and family.  This campaign will allow Dioxin Dump to pay a freelance artist and an editor/project manager to ensure that we produce the best game possible, along with a much larger print run (which brings per-unit cost down) and a whole host of cool physical goods (remember Infocom's \"feelies\"?) that we would otherwise never be able to afford to print.\nEffectively, crowdfunding this game is turning the reality (a card game prototyped with playing cards and mailing labels) into a fully art-ed up published card game with amazing illustrations and extras to go with it. Thanks for looking!\nIf you're into statistics, CLICK THE SHINY GOLD THING:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI ran a very successful kickstarter last fall and I was a few months late on the deadline for shipping print goods. I delivered digital stuff on time but I got hung up on some expansion content and fulfillment issues, and while everyone received what they ordered, I still want to talk about what I learned and how I am going to avoid/fix it this time around:\n\n1. Don't offer expansion content if you don't have it outlined already. I got way excited about the level of success of the last kickstarter and definitely over-promised on content, given how short my turnaround time was. While the main game came out digitally ahead of the time, the full expansion content (weird adventures in suburban America and a separate setting for recreating Hong Kong action flicks) took MUCH longer to write than I expected. Had I outlined each before promising them I would have shifted some deadlines. I think backers for that campaign are still thrilled with their rewards and the overall timeliness, but missing deadlines bothers me.\n\n2. Shipping is costly and time consuming. I somehow expected shipping to be a quick one-or-two day affair. Then it turned out I had 355 backers and most of the packages weren't media mail and many of them required larger bubble mailers and in short shipping turned into a monthlong ordeal. I have a contract inked with the freelancer that edited Three Days Until Retirement to do project management for this campaign, including assistance with shipping. So regardless of how well this campaign does, shipping should be a much smoother process. PROTIP: Print USPS mailing labels and postage at home! Don't be an idiot about it!\n\n3. Art can really slow things down. We ended up with so much extra art (thanks to stretch goals) for the last kickstarter that hitting our production deadlines became impossible. To alleviate that this time, I've gone out of pocket on art for this game, and approximately 40% of it is done. Nikki is a fantastic, professional artist and since the amount of art for this campaign is relatively static (i.e. art for the cards plus maybe some extras, as opposed to illustrating a book) we've put together a timeline that will make sure we can hit our deadlines.\n\nThere is one big Big BIG unknown with this campaign, though, and that's offshore printing. I've got a quote from a reliable printer in China (not Panda!) and they've given me a production timeline that I'm pretty sure they can hit, but I'm adding an extra month or two to the deadline just to make sure we do what we say we're going to do.\n\nKickstarter isn't a cash grab or a marketing platform, it's a community of people that believe in creativity. I endeavor to treat backers as friends and co-creators as well as respect the trust you've placed in us to bring this dream to life.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Internationale!", "update_content": "All international shipping is complete as of TODAY!!!\n\nWe shipped to Finland, Brazil, New Zealand, Canada, Scotland, Australia and all over Great Britain!\n\nI hope you all enjoy the game!\n\nPlease send photos, recaps, feedback etc through here or to stuart@dioxindump.com"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "GREAT NEWS EVERYBODY!", "update_content": "I had a pork chop and eggs for breakfast!\noh and also I guess a couple hundred pounds of card games came in from China or whatever."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN!", "update_content": "Rather, my roommate Jeff dragged it in from where the postlady left it.

Note: The rules and game play video use artwork from the demo version of Antidote and do not include final artwork. The final rules will be re-designed according to the style of the artwork you can see further down on this page.\nSomething went terribly wrong at the lab! Your entire team has been exposed to a deadly toxin and your lab has been locked-down to keep the toxin from getting out! Can you figure out the Antidote before you succumb to the poison?  \nWe're excited to introduce you to Antidote: the deduction-based card game where your life is on the line! For a quick-start video and rules, see \"How to Play\" above.\nIn the game, players take turns deciding what action all other players take: either discard from their hand or trade research with other players. Eventually all your cards will run-out and you will be left with just one that you must \"drink\" and hope its the Antidote. If this card is the true Antidote, you're cured! If not...you die, but you can always try again! \nAntidote has 6 core mechanics that make it unique, fun, and compelling:  \n1. Deduction: Players \"live\" or \"die\" by deducing the one card type that has been removed from the game (similar to Clue). \n2. Semi-Cooperative Gameplay: You live or die alone, but it may be impossible to deduce the Antidote without working with the other players. \n3. Simultaneous action selection: Every turn involves every player. Whether it is making trades for valuable information or simultaneously declassifying your research, all players are constantly engaged. This makes the game experience more fulfilling and eliminates long-periods of \"down-time\" between turns.\n4. Player-controlled game length: Players have sole control over the pace of the game. If you think you know the answer you can speed the game towards its conclusion. If not...well, don't hold your breath! No one is going to wait for you to figure it out! This element adds a feeling of tension and excitement.\n5. Multiple levels of player interaction: Even a \"wink\" or a \"nod\" can have meaning in this game if you are trying to learn or pass information between players. At the same time, a blatant statement such as \"Blue formulas are toxic\" may have no meaning at all, but everyone will judge you by your actions (everyone can see the cards you choose to discard). \n6. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty what the Antidote is by the end of the game. This means the revealing of the Antidote is often met with shouts of joy, groans of agony or other entertaining expressions of fun and players have been known to literally jump out of their seats when they find out the truth!   \nJason Tagmire (designer of Pixel Lincoln): \"Antidote is a quick, 10-minute deduction game that feels like a mini, competitive Pandemic. With fast set-up and maximum replay-ability, my group constantly insisted on going back for another shot. It scratched the deduction itch for us in a quick and different way. I'm looking forward to more plays!\"\nBrian Worrel (Play Games Ames): \"Skillful deduction, keen memory and honed perception skills are essential to surviving this lethal scenario. The games felt tense. The final reveal was always followed by 'Yes!' or 'No way!' or 'Wow, how did I miss that?'\"\nJonathan Nelson (Gaming Bits): This is truly a very fun game. It\u2019s not going to take you long to play and would be great as a precursor to Pandemic.\nTox, (CritsHappen.com): \"The science geek is me is highly intrigued by this game, and the gamer in me loves the style. Bring on the Antidote!\"\nK.B. Hoyle (author): \"Antidote, definitely the most fun I've ever had trying to defend myself against a deadly outbreak! Help your friends stay alive, or let them die. It's up to you!\"\nPaul Meuth (gamer): \"My friends and I found this game easy to pickup. Within minutes we were devising ways to deceive each other. The longer we played, the louder the laughter became.\"\nJonathan Schindler, FarmerLenny from iSlaytheDragon.com: \"Antidote hits several sweet spots for a deduction game. It has minimal components, simple rules, and a clever concept. Beyond this, it's also very (sometimes uproariously) fun.\"\nYi-ling Hu (casual gamer): \"Antidote is a really fun game! It's fun because you have to remember other player's action, and try to mislead them with your action. I enjoyed this game a lot and I can't wait to play with my friends.\"\nThe following people tried the Antidote Print and Play during the campaign and had this to say about Antidote:\nSteven C: Played the game last night with four others and it was a hit. Simple to play and very fun. Nothing more exciting than flipping the face down antidote card over at the end and laughing because everyone died except yourself.\nIsaac H: Just played the Print`N`Play and absolutely loved it with 2 players. We were hurriedly trying to guess the correct antidote before forcing the game to end, leaving the other desperately using syringes and swapping research. Brilliant fun. We were laughing and kicking ourselves every time we won or lost.\nMike T: After three plays with my PnP version, I'm enjoying this and itching for more.\nThe base game includes 56 full-color front and back cards (310 gsm ivory core) in a sturdy top-and-bottom box with matte finish and a full-color rule booklet.  \nIn addition, every copy pledged for on Kickstarter will also include EVERY \"Stretch Goal\" (see below) reached throughout the course of the project. The more stretch goals we reach, the more will be included in the game! (UPDATE) In the last few minutes of the campaign we reached Level 9 on the Stretch Goals list, which means The Kickstarter Edition of Antidote will contain 99 cards!\nThe following images are examples of cards that will be included in the game. (Please note the Kickstarter Syringe, Hamartia Syringe and Kickstarter Turn Marker card are exclusive to the Kickstarter Edition).\nEvery stretch goal reached during the campaign will be included in every funding level of the project! That means, the more funding we receive, the more you get (at no extra cost to you!) The base funding level includes everything you need to have an awesome experience with Antidote. Stretch goals just provide everyone with more! See the chart below for all the stretch goals we've planned so far: \nWe plan to use Panda Game Manufacturing, an experienced and reputable manufacturer to manufacture the game. You can learn more about Panda Games and previous games they've produced at their website.\nTo be fully funded, we'll need somewhere around 800 backers, which is a lot of games to ship by hand! That's why we are talking with a couple different fulfillment companies at the moment to decide which one will fulfill all the pledges from the project. As pledges come in we will be better able to determine which company to choose since their rate structures vary slightly.\nShipping information is included in the pledge levels to the right. If you are a US backer, no additional amount for shipping is requested. For Canadian and World-Wide backers, we've requested an additional amount to help cover the very expensive costs for us to ship directly to you. \nEU backers: At this time we are not able to offer shipping from within the EU, but we are exploring options to reduce this cost for you.\nWe know you're taking a risk when you back a Kickstarter project. That's why we're offering a money back guarantee. After receiving your copy of Antidote, if you decide it didn't meet your expectations, you can return it within 4 weeks for a full refund of your pledge level. (This guarantee does not apply to the Hang Out, Chemical Researcher or Biochemical Researcher pledge levels.)\nFor every $8 you add to your pledge we'll send you a copy of Drop Site, a card game with a humanitarian focus. This is a limited first-print edition of the game, so it is only available while supplies are available. We'll send you Drop Site at the conclusion of the project (if it is funded).\nWe are also going to be making Antidote T-Shirts! Click \"Manage your Pledge\" and please ADD $20 to your pledge if you would like the T-Shirt. See the design below!\nWe believe Antidote is a game that needs to be made and we want to share it with as many people as we can! That's why we chose Kickstarter. Kickstarter is more than just a \"crowd-funding\" platform, it's a way to form a community around a creative project, and Kickstarter is arguably the best venue for sharing creative works like Antidote with the world. With Kickstarter, we get to work together as a team with all of you to make Antidote a reality. If we successfully reach funding, we all benefit together, and every stretch goal we reach gives everyone even more. \nThe comments section of this campaign is also a great way to talk about this project and to collaborate as a community to continue to build the world of Antidote. If you have comments, ideas or suggestions, share them on this page for everyone to see. We are open to feedback, and want to make Antidote the best it can possibly be.\nYour support on social media sites (any that you use!) is also an incredibly important way to help us reach our goal. \nAntidote Facebook Fan Page\nBellwether Games Fan Page\nBellwether Games Twitter\nPlease consider changing your avatar on your social media sites to help support this cause:\nWe've spent a lot of time looking at the numbers to find the optimal balance between the cost of the pledge levels and overall funding goal. It works a little like this: the more we ask for pledge levels the fewer the backers we need to cover our costs of manufacturing and fulfillment (we've already invested the money for the art and design work), but the more we ask for pledge levels, the less of a discount you get from the final retail price. \nWe've priced Antidote competitively, but also so the project can be funded faster. Since our minimum manufacturing quantity is 1,500 units, at the funding goal we've selected of $12,500, we've ensured we'll be able to produce a high quality product from a reliable manufacturer at a reasonable price and ship the game directly to you without losing more money than we are able to commit to the project. \nIt only costs us about $6,500 to manufacture 1500 units of the game and have them shipped to our warehouse in the US, but it costs us about $6 per game to ship directly to you in the US (more world wide). This means our costs increase with the number of backers. Our funding goal of $12,500 has been selected because it is the point at which we can produce the game AND get it shipped directly to you (and all the backers) without losing more money than we are currently able to commit to the project.   \nAntidote is a joint project between Bellwether Games LLC and Lumne. Bellwether Games LLC was founded in 2011 and specializes in tabletop game development and game design analysis. \nLumne was founded in 2012 by Jonathan Clark specializing in web design, creative development, graphic design and game artwork. Lumne is responsible for Antidote graphics, finishing work and assists with marketing this project.\nIf funded, Antidote will be the second published game of designer Dennis Hoyle, whose first game was Drop Site, winner of the 2010 Premio Archimede Carta Mundi Special Prize for best card game. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've worked hard to minimize the risks of backing this project. This has included months of research and play testing. Despite our front-end work, however, there are still risks and challenges we could encounter in the completion of Antidote.\n\n-Personal illness or death: There are only two of us working on this project, so if one of us suffers a personal tragedy, this could delay or cancel the project before it is completed. \n-Natural disaster or other \"act of God\": We simply cannot forsee certain risks. The ship carrying Antidote could unpredictably sink, or political unrest could cause fulfillment delays. You can imagine the worst.\n-First Kickstarter: Although this is the first Kickstarter project we've created, its not the first game we've designed or the first time we've been involved in shipping large volumes of units overseas. Nevertheless, there may be ways we could run a project better that we haven't yet discovered.\n-Unexpected costs: We've already researched as many expenses as possible to make sure we've covered our bases here, but as with any project there may be other costs we find later in the project, that could slow the project down.\n\nDespite the risks, we are committed to making Antidote a successful project. We are doing this project because we want you to play and enjoy Antidote. Furthermore, both Bellwether Games and Lumne have a vested interest in producing a great product for you so we can continue to make great games in the future and have your support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Expanding Today!

They must then covertly discover who is on the team and who they can trust by dropping their password in conversation and using their role's special ability. \nWhy do these password cards look different than the ones in the video? See Update #11 for an answer.\nAs the game goes on, players find their teammates, infiltrate the other team, eavesdrop on other players' conversations, figure out their opponent's roles and passwords, discern the identity of the traitor on their team (the rat), sow misinformation by leaking false passwords, force enemies to reveal their cards, and use power cards to take points from other players.\nThe team that accumulate the most points by collecting point cards, figuring out the enemy team's roles and passwords, and identifying the rat on their team at the end of the game is the winner!\n40 Role Cards\n40 Power Cards\n75 Password Cards\n40 Blank Password Cards for custom passwords.\n100 Point Cards\n2 Rat Cards\n1 Whiskey Shipment Card\n1 Pad of Mob/Feds Info Sheets (more will be available to print at thegamehaschanged.net/speakeasy/)\n1 Instruction Booklet\n Read the story of Speakeasy from inception to Kickstarter to hear how the game has grown, changed, and developed over the past three years.\nGame on. You head straight to a quiet corner and take a secretive peek at your cards, and memorize your role and password.\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re the Senator. (Welcome to the Feds!) Your password card says \u201cHesitate.\u201d So you head back into the crowd and start identifying potential teammates. You listen hard for anyone dropping the word \u201chesitate\u201d in conversation, and start telling stories of your six-year-old self hesitating before jumping off the diving board.\nThe Senator has plenty of strings he can pull back at the capitol. Your role\u2019s special power is insider knowledge: specifically, the Moderator will disclose to you the identities of two players. Just to be safe, you decide to use this power to discover one ally and one enemy. \u201cModerator,\u201d you say quietly, \u201cA word on the sidewalk in thirty seconds?\u201d You ask for the names of the Federal Marshal, the most connected role on your team, and the Boss, the most connected role in the Mob.\nSo now you know that John is the knight-like Federal Marshal, and Mary is the big bad Boss. You approach John, tell him what you\u2019ve done, and show him your password card to prove that you\u2019re on the same team (the Federal Marshal starts off with all of the Fed passwords). You and John decide to work together. He thinks you should purchase the Subpoena power card from the Moderator. You might lose a point in the process, but a Subpoena allows you to draw two cards from any player whose password you know, keep any point cards you draw, and give the rest back. John has a plan.\nIt\u2019s time to start gathering some enemy intelligence. You know Mary is a Mobster, so you innocently join her conversation. Soon, you realize she\u2019s saying the word \u201cfish\u201d an awful lot. Could it be her password? You corner Mary and say she\u2019s been subpoenaed, brandishing the power card for proof. \u201c\u2019Fish\u2019 is sounding pretty fishy to me,\u201d you say. \u201cLet me draw.\u201d Turns out your hunch was right, and Mary fans out her cards for you to choose. A Senator doesn\u2019t like a blind draw, so you take your time as John the Federal Marshal takes a stroll behind Mary\u2019s shoulder and makes note of her team\u2019s valuable passwords. You draw two cards from Mary and one of them is a point. You look at them both, keep the point, and return the other card.\nTime for you and the Federal Marshal to split up and work different strategies. Since he has all of the Fed passwords, he\u2019s going to start rallying the troops by listening for those words and making contact with the players saying them. As for you? Well, John passed on all of the Mob\u2019s passwords to you when he saw Mary\u2019s cards. And so, ever the politician, you\u2019re going to work the other side by infiltrating the other team and leaking some false information. You scribble a few fake answers onto your info sheet and strike up a conversation. \u201cGolly, I could use a drink,\u201d you say casually to the first player you see, using one of the Mob passwords John passed along. \u201cWhere can a person get a drink around here?\u201d But the person you are talking to doesn\u2019t notice, so you try someone else. Finally: \u201cWait a minute,\u201d Angelina says. \u201cThat\u2019s my password. Are you a Mobster?\u201d You reply that you are indeed. The two of you step away from the crowd and you show her your fake Mob info sheet. She writes down the fake roles and passwords of her supposed teammates.\nAngelina also shows you her info sheet, and you copy down the information she was able to gather. Turns out your friend Thomas is the Mob\u2019s Hitman and that Sally also has \u201cdrink\u201d for a password. You promise to check in later as you both learn more. After she walks away, you grab John and tell him the information you learned. He introduces you to Richard, a Vigilante working with the Feds. You obtained your one power card already, but Richard hasn\u2019t. The three of you head straight to the Moderator to see how a power card can help the Feds use \u201cdrink\u201d against a Mobster.\nAs the game goes on, you continue to identify and organize your teammates, learn the roles and passwords of the Mob, use special abilities of the roles on your team, sow misinformation among your opposition, infiltrate the other team, acquire point cards, and protect your own. It\u2019s a dirty job, but somebody has to do it.\nThe above is just an overview of Speakeasy.

You're tasked with defending your division of the NorTec base as wave after wave of horrific aliens attempt to destroy the base and end NorTec's strip mining operation.\nXenoShyft Onslaugt is a base defense deck-building game for 1 to 4 players. Using a wide array of troops, weapons, armors, and technology cards, players must last 9 rounds as the alien hordes bombard the NorTec base in increasingly difficult waves. \nXenoShyft Onsluaght has many deck-building elements, but plays more like a table top version of the base-defense game genre made popular on mobile devices.\nGameplay Features\n1 - 4 players - Single player compatible, fully cooperative gameplay.\nStrong focus on coordination and strategic planning - to overcome the game's intense difficulty players will need to work together.\n60 Minute game length\nBase-Defense with deck-building elements\nIncredible art - Illustrated by three amazing artists, XenoShyft features beautiful and consistent art.

Do take note that, being an Alpha, images, rules, (and typos!) are subject to change.\nAlready well-known and respected for our ability to bring big box games to the market that feature dozens upon dozens of highly detailed miniatures, XenoShyft Onslaught represents a new direction for CoolMiniOrNot. \nWith XenoShyft CoolMiniOrNot wanted to create a deck-building style game that task players with working together rather than defeating one another. This goal lead to the development of an outstandingly brutal card-based game that played more like a tower defense game then your standard deck builder. Furthermore this focus made the game not only a great cooperative experience, but also allows Xenoshyft Onslaught  to function as a single player game. \nOne of the most appealing aspects of all CoolMiniOrNot games is our ability to consistently make some of the best miniatures in the board game market. However, being a card based game, XenoShyft Onslaught has no miniatures, not including the Ajax First Player token only available to Kickstarter backers. This allowed our art direction team to use their keen eye to create one of the most beautiful card games ever made. We brought on three amazingly talented artists to create all the cards for XenoShyft Onslaught.\nThanks to this, all of the art in XenoShyft Onslaught is cohesive, beautiful, and, most importantly, creates one horrifically realized science fiction universe. \nComponents\nOver 400 beautifully illustrated cards\n1 Large fold-out poster gameboard\n1 Rubber backed playmat\n2 D10 dice  - for tracking base health points.\n20 Cardboard wound markers\n20 Cardboard ability markers\n1 Specially designed Vacuum formed tray - designed to organize and hold all your cards, both with and without sleeves. \n1 Rule book.\nThe XenoShyft Onslaught core box is a huge value for players already familiar with the card game genre. The game contains: over 400 cards that feature the best art seen in an original I.P. game. One large fold-out poster gameboard that is a great way to learn and teach the game because it clearly displays where all cards go. A rubber-backed play mat that duplicated the center of the poster gameboard, perfect for organizing the resource pool an for players who utilize a smaller gaming space. 2 D10 dice, 20 cardboard wound markers, and 20 cardboard ability markers, for tracking base health, damage on NorTect Troops and Hive Aliens, and used or exhausted abilities. Finally, we've spent a great deal of time designing the vacuum-formed tray that players will find inside the XenoShyft Onslaught  core box. We've taken great care to make sure the tray holds all 400+ cards, with separate slots to organize the cards, so the different card types will all have their own unique space for easy storage and retrieval. Best of all, all slots are wide enough for the cards to be sleeved if the player chooses to do so.\nPledge Levels\nNorTec Commander Early Bird!\nThis level includes: the XenoShyft Onslaught core game, which will retail for $59.99, 4 folding lane boards, which will retail for $15, and the Kickstarter exclusive Ajax First Player Token.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign concludes.\nThis is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.  \nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $11 to ship in the USA, about $20-$25 in the EU (due to VAT), and $11 to Hong Kong all the way up to $39 for Australia, but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and your carrier choices.\nStretch Goals\nAll Health and Ability Markers will be upgraded from cardboard to plastic for all boxes! \nAll boxes will get a Spin Down Life Counter instead of the 2 D10 dice.\nAll boxes will get the Command Center Divsion Card!\nAll boxes will get the Barracks Divsion Card!\nA unique Wave 1 Hive Boss Card will be added to every box of XenoShyft Onslaught!

Answers at 1PM Eastern)\nThirteen Orphans reviews Heat!\nHeat is a simple to teach game, with intrigue and strategy that builds up the more you play it.  You'll play through three heists, drafting cards before each, and then paying off the Heat you've gained at the end.\nHere's what's inside!\nAnd here's a video explanation of the game:\nPLAY\n\nHeat is easy to get to the table, and only takes about 20-30 minutes to play including a quick explanation.  While the mechanics are simple, the depth of the game will become apparent after a few plays when you start predicting the cards others' play, telling white lies about your own plans, and using your misdirecting intrigue to outmaneuver your fellow criminals!  Heat is fun, and you will like it.\nThe rules and cards for Heat are available for download for free here: http://asmadigames.com/heat/HeatRules_PnP.pdf\nThe rules will be laid out in booklet format for the print edition, but not until we know the precise box size we're going with, and that depends on some of the Stretch Goals below!\nNote that while the Print and Play includes just the cards, and not the tokens, the real edition will contain everything you need to play!\nThe Designer: Dave Chalker is the designer of Heat.  You probably know him from Get Bit, which won an Origins Award and was on TableTop.  I know him because we've been going to Origins for approximately ever!  When he told me about the concept for Heat, I immediately jumped on it and got our elite art squad working on it.\nThe Artist: Cara Judd drew all those things for all those cards.  She is the artist for Innovation, and the most important game ever made, Win, Lose or Banana! Cara likes to scuba dive, and hopes to one day meet a squid.  They seem like pretty cool dudes.\nThe Composer: Jesse Ratterree, aka Beatscribe, composed the heisty music in our video, and is also working on all the music for Asmadi Games' upcoming project, Consequential.  If you're looking for someone to do music for a KS vid, you should talk to him!  \nThe Voice: Kate McDermott led you through the basics of Heist training, and likes to move in a diagonal fashion.  She also will be providing the voice of Caliana for Consequential.  Kate is most likely not currently stealing a muffin from your countertop...but can you be sure?\nThe Developer: Chris Cieslik, that's me!  I move all the numbers around and come up with ideas that make good games great.  Sometimes I make completely unplaytested games, but that is a different story.  \nOur current operation is a heist.  We're going to steal a small amount of money from each of you, and in exchange we'll give you some card game.  In fact, we're so cool that if our heist is really successful, we'll make the game even better:\n If, by some insanity we exceed $40,000, we will make up stretch goals involving a penguin.  \nSTRETCH GOALS COMPRESSED!  We squished down the levels for all the Stretch Goals.  We hope we can reach some!\n The backer levels for Heat aren't too complex because we like running a pretty simple heist, except for two interesting twists...\nThe Steal: There's one available at the start of the campaign, and sometime during each day we'll quietly make another available.  First one to the page gets it!  Remember that you can adjust your backer level even after you've backed :)\nThe Story: We will collaborate on an excellent Heist story for you, based on some prompting from you.

However, players are restricted in connecting railcars of only the same value or good type, so if you grab a railcar you can't use, it needs to wait in your sorting yard until it can legitimately hook up to your train.\nPlayers start with three cargo cards in hand, and three railcar cards are laid out on the table. Each player has one exchange token in one of the four colors, and whoever is to the right of the start player has a Yardmaster token. On a turn, a player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired; whoever holds the Yardmaster token takes a third action on her turn, then passes this token to the right. Players can:\nDraw a cargo card from the deck or (in most cases) from the top of the discard pile.\nBuy a railcar by discarding 1-4 cargo cards of the same color as the railcar, with the number determined by that railcar's value.\nSwap your exchange token for another one; you can discard two cargo cards matching the color of your token to represent one cargo card of the proper color when buying a railcar.\nEight cargo cards provide bonus actions during play, such as drawing extra cargo cards or paying less cargo to purchase a railcar.

The game is every much a hybrid of action based brawlers, like Double Dragon, and action RPGs, like Fallout III.\nOur primary goal has always been to make a great beat-em-up with some depth to the combat, and when people play it they generally agree that we've been successful. They also have suggestions, which we have used to make the game better! \nInstead of spending time memorizing inputs, you just pick moves from a quick to use menu, and make cool combos made up of strikes, preset combo strings and grapples/throws to take on a your enemies.\nPlayers can also use Quick Strikes which are great for breaking open objects and can also be used to fight enemies.\nThere are also over the top super moves that do high amounts of damage to any enemies they hit. \nThe game really feels like a combination brawler & tactics game, never veering too far to one side.\n 3 heroes, 3 ways to play!\n Bruce  Maxwell is the lightweight fighter mixing in dance with acrobatic strikes that have a little bit of \"magic\" to his moves.\nBy day Bruce is a wealthy stockbroker with an affinity for Asian languages and culture, but also very proud of his Jamaican roots.\n Lisa Santiago is the middleweight fighter focusing on mixed martial arts and boxing.

Pledge with confidence.\nPay Dirt is an engine building, worker placement game set in frigid Alaska for 2-4 players. Players are competing to manage and grow their entire mining outfit while acquiring the most gold before the ground is too frozen to dig. The Alaskan countryside is an inhospitable environment, so players will face hardships that affect their entire outfit \u2013 not to mention the ever-dropping temperature that will shut down their operation.\nIn Pay Dirt, players start with a small basic crew, an unimpressive claim, mediocre equipment and just a little bit of cash to make a go in one of the toughest competitions this side of the globe. Gold mining isn\u2019t cheap and players will have to sell their gold throughout the game to keep the equipment running and their workers happy. Through clever use of their equipment and workers, players can make their mining outfits more efficient and dialed in to their preference of play. Will you recruit heavily and stack your camp with workers or will you keep your eyes on better and more efficient equipment?

It has truly been an awesome and rewarding journey with Rise!, The Lost Dutchman, Dungeon Heroes, Paradise Fallen, Council of Verona and \"Where Art Thou, Romeo?\".\nThe conversations that we have had with you all at conventions, local game stores, BGG and here on Kickstarter truly inspire us to continue creating and acting as a channel to bring talented designers' and artists' work into the hobby all while helping people create lifelong memories with their friends and family. We are eternally grateful and humbled by your support and we continue to need that support for Pay Dirt; we simply cannot do this without you. Whether you are a first time backer of Crash Games or a long time supporter there simply aren't enough words to say thank you!\nThe first thank you has to be to Tory Niemann. I cannot thank you enough for trusting me with your game over two years ago when you had very little reason to do so. I hope that I have fulfilled my promise to do Pay Dirt justice. It is a privilege to be able to call you a friend.\nMy second thank you is to Naomi Robinson for saving Pay Dirt with your glorious art. You have created a rich and engaging world for Pay Dirt and without you I wouldn't be launching this project. You have no idea how thankful I am for you and your art.\nA big thank you to Darrell Louder for your amazing graphic design. Pay Dirt is far from an easy project and you have been there every step of the way. I wouldn't want to do this with anyone else.\nThank you to all the play testers who have played Pay Dirt over the last two years and to all the fans who patiently waited for this game that I said was \"coming soon\" That time is now.\nThank you to all the reviewers who take time out of their busy lives and schedules to review games, especially without charging money for it. Your contribution is invaluable to the process and without you I know that I would have hundreds if not thousands of less backers.\nThank you to my amazing nephew, Spencer who is very involved in Crash Games. The countless hours of work you do behind the scenes really helps each game grow and with that Crash Games grows. You have really come along as a developer and a salesman. I truly relish sharing this experience with you. \nThank you to the awesome people at Board With Life, especially Donald Shults and Chris Sabat.

We grew up playing the classics: Streets of Rage, Double Dragon, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardian Heroes, The Punisher, Aliens Vs. Predator, etc. When setting out to create a new game in the genre we wanted to take the things we loved, and build on that. Also, we noticed when studying the greats that there are problems too, like brain dead enemies, overpowered moves, and gameplay that tends to favor dominant strategies that break the \"fun\".\nWe're here to reinvent the way you play a side scrolling beat \u2018em up because we want to grow the genre!\nTactical Brawling: Use real time movement to walk around the arena, and even use some real time attacks to break open a few garbage cans or mailboxes for health or other items. When it comes to attacking, your COMBO menu becomes your best tool. \nUsing a combination of Fight Points (FP) and combo meter, players of all skill types can choose up to 3 moves out of dozens of moves that will be learned over the course of the adventure to create any number of unique combinations of attacks.\nCombine strikes with grapples, or do multiple grapple moves in a row. It's your choice!\nOver 26 unique enemies and growing! : Enemies look different, walk differently and all have their own unique ways of attacking. The only repetition in attacks is that there are only so many ways that a person can throw a punch. Enemies range from fast and agile to slow, lumbering and extremely powerful. Some will charge you, others will play keep away.\nPlus many more to come!\nEnemies are broken down into class types.\nGrunts have regular attacks, but also usually have 1 or 2 hidden super strong attacks.\nSneaky enemies focus on lowering offensive options for players.\nGrapplers focus on throwing the player.\nSupport characters taunt and cheer in the fight to cast buffs on your foes and give them an advantage. \nGiants have super strong offense, but are often on the slower side.\nThese class types make fighting mixed groups of enemies a real challenge. And enemies can take on sub classes, so there can be a Giant Support with enormous amounts of HP and high evade or a grappler grunt who has strong strikes as well as strong grapples!\nThe possibilities are endless!\nLearn a large array of new moves as the game goes on! \u2013 Moves aren\u2019t in just for the sake of adding moves, as every attack, defensive maneuver and combo is tested and included only if it adds to the fighting mechanics in a positive way.\nExperimentation & creativity are key elements to the experience whereas execution is not.\nIn Progress Over world map\nTop down overworld exploration gameplay: Choose your paths through East Fulton, looking for hidden items to heal or power up your player and encounter hidden boss fights that teach your fighters even more moves! \nPlus, heal your player, seek out shortcuts through densely populated areas and find files on every enemy in the game. Read those to find out enemy weaknesses and their personal stories. \nSuper special attacks! : It wouldn\u2019t be a beat \u2018em up without a super bar that fills up and allows players to turn the tide in battle. Some of these moves can even be chained from regular attacks!\nA dark humor story played out in classic frame by frame cutscenes : Engage with enemies, find out the personalities behind the heroes and enemies and perhaps gain empathy for them\u2026 before having to lay a beatdown on them.\nTeaser trailer from 2013, featuring a brief story introduction.\nSwitch characters strategically!: Each of the player characters has his or her strengths and weaknesses against every enemy in the game. Switching can be done on the overworld with the press of a button, and strategic use of each characters strengths can make a fight that would usually be very difficult much easier. \nDamage taken in between fights is cumulative, so make sure to switch, or heal your character before their next fight!\nThe cover!\nHealth items found by breaking objects\nEnemy bios\nNinja Dragon Terrorist concept art\nExample attack\nFrom concept sketch to finished pixel art\nThe cast\nElectric Spin Kick\nBruce Maxwell is a wealthy stockbroker with an affinity for Asian languages and culture, without forgetting his Jamaican roots.

Brad runs a community center in the SoNo section of East Fulton to help people in need. Brad is the heavyweight character fighting with high powered wrestling throws and heavy strikes. \nIcy Spin Lobs\nLisa Santiago is enrolled in the police academy and has an eye for forensic science. She focuses on boxing and mma, with a mix of holds and brutal kicks/punches.\nClick here for a more in depth look at the backgrounds of the cast.\n These are just a few tracks from the very beginning of the game, all made by the amazing INVERSEPHASE!\nWe started this project conceptually as a way to create something new and inventive while working other jobs in the AAA games industry back in 2009. Since then the amount of effort put in has grown significantly when we figured out that this was something people actually would want to play, and 2013 was the first full year that we were able to work on Treachery in Beatdown City in full time mode.\nWe spent most of that year building the core fighting system, but any good fighting system is built with tweaks to balance, as well as additions to the system. We have also gathered a lot of playtesting feedback from a large amount of people from a number of shows like PAX, Indiecade, GDC, E3 and the world\u2019s largest international fighting game tournament, EVO. \nOur current progress is that we are almost done with the first level which takes a few hours to beat (longer than most full length brawlers!). The level features numerous songs, over 26 completely unique enemies and dozens of player attacks. We plan to add 5 more levels that will add at least another 20 enemies, a couple of dozen more attacks as well as more exotic locations and music to go along with them that we can't quite reveal yet.\nBeyond adding content we will also be porting the game to Unity out of the Playstation Mobile framework and that, while similar, is a very different environment that will no doubt speed up our development, but will require moving over and changing the code as necessary.\nTreachery in Beatdown City is all about creating a tactical brawler with fighting game elements, so of course we need the community to give us feedback on how best to tweak for balance. Every single backer will be able to play the game early, while those who want to get in extra early can pledge to gain even earlier access to in production levels to help us build the best fights possible.\nThe only way we\u2019ll be able to launch in early 2015 is with your help. \nBudget breakdown\nWe have already invested quite a lot of our own funds into this game, and have already paid for some of the events/talks that we will be attending this year to support Treachery in Beatdown City - the next one being GDC in March. \nBesides that, Manny and I are working on the game full time, and need support to cover bare minimum living expenses for the next year. \nShawn will be creating the individually drawn art for 5 or more new levels, (which don't all take place in the city, and will even end up in areas like a desert) as well as close to 30 + new enemies, complete with new animations and profile pictures, as well as writing all of the dialog and all of the other things that will need to be taken care of. \nManny will be doing all of the coding, creating all of the new enemy behavior patterns and setting up all of the new enemy battle systems and encounters. \nBetween the two of them they will also be the primary QA people, with a few friends helping out with primary bug fixes and taking all of your data to tweak the game.\nWe will also be paying Inverse Phase for all of the remaining music that he will create. \nAnd this is not counting Diana who donates a lot of her spare time to consult on and create all of the production art assets that you see, and other industry friends who will be helping out with copy editing on the writing. \nThis is all keeping in mind that Kickstarter & Amazon payments takes their fees, and reward fulfillment fees as well. \nEven though we are working to get the game done by around February of next year, we will still need to work past that to give you, and everyone else, post launch support, as well.\nWe have new shirt ideas!\nVote on a 2nd shirt option!\nCheck out the near finished art for the RAD ENOUGH tier t-shirt\nARE YOU RAD ENOUGH TO WEAR THIS SHIRT?\nShirt detailing - High Res drawing\nWant to be on a poster?

She also created those lenticular business cards that Shawn carries around, in case you've ever seen them.\nShe has her Masters in Fine Art and she is also a performance artist and co-creator of the web series Supertight. She had been married to Shawn for just 6 months before development of Treachery in Beatdown City became a full time thing, when the prototype was in full swing. \nDiana was working part time while Shawn worked in AAA, but took on a full time job to keep the family afloat during development. \nInverse Phase (@inversephase) is the composer for all of the music. Previously he had music on a number of soundtracks including the Super Meatboy OST. Besides working with Shawn to develop the musical tone of Treachery in Beatdown City he also launched a Trent Reznor approved Nine Inch Nails cover CD called Pretty Eight Machine, after having a successful kickstarter to raise funds for it.\nOver the year he has played excerpts from the Treachery in Beatdown City soundtrack at events like Magfest that got the crowd going wild.\nIf you would like to hear more from Shawn, he was on Destructoid's Sup Holmes late in 2013 and you can check out the interview below! Find out how he ended up being attacked at his Gamestop job a week before working at Rockstar games!\nIn order to add-on to your pledge, you can go and manage your pledge and just add the amount for any extras you want to pick up.

After all, sitting in traffic probably lives somewhere in the neighborhood of root canal and taxes on our list of least favorite things to do.\nBut here's the thing: you don't know what you think you know about traffic. \nWe tend to think of a traffic jam as something that just happens for no reason, something that just has to be endured.  That's what I thought one day when I was stuck in horrible traffic trying to get home to Brooklyn from Connecticut.  But then I started to wonder: what really causes traffic and can cities do anything about it?\nThe answer, many experts will tell you, is that the traffic problems that plague many of our cities are the result of deliberate policy decisions made over the course of more than half a century.\nMost importantly, we changed the definition of a street--from a place where people gathered to meet and conduct business, to a means to get a car from one place to another.  That change paved the way (sometimes literally) for the car's dominance over most of the 20th century.\nNow, though, a group of advocates and urban designers is trying to change that. They're working to reclaim streets as places for people rather than just pathways for cars.\n\"In Transit\" tells their story.\n\"So this isn't a documentary about traffic.  It's a documentary about people.\"\nRight.  Because changing the way streets are designed and used isn't easy.\nI've filmed planners in Detroit who must convince a skeptical community that the Motor City's comeback could begin with more pedestrian and bike friendly streets. \nIn New York, I've investigated why bike lanes and bike share are sometimes seen as benefits for hipster elites even though the cost of traveling by bike is far less than traveling by car.\nAnd with this Kickstarter campaign, I hope to raise funds to continue to find more of the people and the stories that are changing cities all over the country.\n\"So how does Kickstarter work?\"\nKickstarter is a crowd-funding platform that allows backers to support independent creative projects.  In addition to helping tell an important story about how cities are changing, your donation entitles you to some of the rewards listed at right.  Everybody wins!\nKickstarter is an all-or-nothing platform, which means we need to meet our $25,000 goal or no money changes hands.  But with your support, I'm confident we can make that money change hands!  Just click on the \"Back This Project\" button and complete the Amazon checkout process.\nAnd remember, while we can't raise less than our goal, we can--and would love to--raise more.  The more money we raise, the more filming we can do\nSo please share our project on Facebook, Twitter, e-mail, and carrier pigeon.\nThe \"In Transit\" sticker and bike bell\n\"What will you use the money for?\"\nStreets are changing all over the country (and the world), but so far \"In Transit\" has filmed in only two cities.  With these funds, I'll be able to seek out and capture stories in a variety of locations that truly tell the story of America's streets.\nThanks for joining me on the journey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProbably the biggest question any independent filmmaker faces is: \"Can you really finish your film?\" To paraphrase Shakespeare, the course of documentary production never did run smooth, and if you're backing a project, you want to know that the creators can deliver even when they face challenges.\n\nFortunately, I'm an experienced documentary film producer. Check out my bio at the upper right for full details, and you'll see that I've successfully produced and distributed an independent documentary, worked as an editor for other widely seen productions, and produced videos for large companies and non-profit organizations.\n\n\"In Transit\" is at an early stage of production (which is why most of the rewards have an estimated delivery date of late 2015). There are going to be challenges along the way. But solving challenges and completing successful productions is what I do.\n\nAnd with your help, I know I can do the same with \"In Transit.\" Rest assured, I'll keep you up to date along the way. And at the end, I hope to have created a film of which we can all be proud.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 10, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/220318352/in-transit", "project_name": "In Transit"}}, {"backer": "God Hates Games", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Spread the word!

(2/7/14)!\nWe're very, very happy to introduce a new poster option designed by FEZ creator Phil Fish! It'll be a high-quality print on a delicately textured surface with glossy, smooth-finished text. There's a new tier over to the right at the same cost as the existing poster tier. We won't have the other poster design until after the Kickstarter campaign is over, but don't worry! We'll be sending out a backer's poll after both designs have gone out and you can choose then which design you'd like.\nNEW OUTERLANDS SHORT (1/29/14)!\nHere's a taste of what Outerlands will be like. We'll have another short ready for you before the Kickstarter campaign is over. Thank you for your support!\nFIVE NEW DIGITAL TIERS (2/5/14)!\nOur fantastic music collaborators Jim Guthrie and Disasterpeace have offered up some INCREDIBLE music bundles for our backers! We've got new options at $45, $50, $70, $100, and $135. You can get entire bundles of music at each of those tiers, but the $70 tier is an extremely limited (10 ONLY) offering where Jim will personally sign and send you a vinyl of Sword & Sworcery LP - The Ballad of the Space Babies. If you haven't heard the S&S music or seen the artwork before, they're both incredbly impressive!\nWHAT IS OUTERLANDS?\nA DOCUMENTARY \"TV SERIES\" ... Even though this isn't for a TV network, we're calling it a \"TV series\" because of the format. It'll be a minimum of six one-hour episodes. A TV \"one hour\" can mean anything from 42 to 60 minutes.\nIN SIX EPISODES ... We could potentially do more than six if we reach some of our stretch goals!\nABOUT THE PEOPLE AND CULTURE OF VIDEOGAMES ... Videogames are art. Art is culture. Within any culture are beautiful traditions, heartfelt passions, and incredible, unbelievable stories to be told. That's where Outerlands comes in.\nTHAT CAN'T BE MADE ANY OTHER WAY. Traditional media outlets, broadcast networks, and even the new wave of original content from online distribution aren't going to take a \"risk\" on videogame content. We don't think it is a risk. We think videogames are a global cultural revolution that's sweeping in whole new ways of looking at the world, inspiring countless people into new lives, and that untold numbers are aching for this kind of content. Help us prove it!\nWHY $210,000?\nVideo is expensive\u2014especially documentary content that requires ongoing access over a long period and a lot of travel. AREA 5 has become very good at knowing how much a production is going to cost. Originally, we were thinking about showing a bunch of awful spreadsheets and writing walls of text to explain where the money is going. Fortunately, Braid artist David Hellman came to our rescue!\nWHO'S MAKING IT?\nAREA 5 is Ryan O'Donnell, Matt Chandronait, Jason Bertrand, Cesar Quintero, and Rick Curnutte. You can find out more about us on the AREA 5 web site. We're also collaborating with some INCREDIBLE people that are just as excited as we are to make this happen! And, if we hit our FREELANCERS STRETCH GOAL, there will be even more people added to the team!\nIS IT ONLY ABOUT PRESERVING OLD GAMES? (ANSWER: NO!)\nGame preservation is only one important topic\u2014one which is particularly easy to tackle in the San Francisco Bay Area (where AREA 5 is located), which is why it's the featured example in our Kickstarter video. Our ambition is to explore every story that we can possibly afford to! To give you a better idea of what we're going for, this series is directly inspired by This American Life, Radiolab, Objectified and Helvetica, A Life Well Wasted, 99% Invisible, Polygon's Human Angle, State of Play, and, of course Indie Game: The Movie.\nWHAT OTHER TOPICS WILL THE SERIES COVER?\nIt goes by pretty fast in the Kickstarter video, but there's a scene with a cloud of words in there. Those topics are just a taste of what's on our list. We can't even imagine the kinds of stories other minds can bring into the fold if we can get to our FREELANCERS STRETCH GOAL!  We will also be holding polls and surveys throughout the Kickstarter period to hear about topics YOU want to cover! \nA small sampling of topics we think will result in incredible stories\nWILL YOU DELIVER THE EPISODES AS YOU FINISH THEM?\nNo. We know from experience that we'll get the absolute highest quality by shooting and editing everything together. Whether you're backing at a level that gets you the series digitally or on Blu-ray, you'll get the entire season as a package. Filming a documentary is about being there and we want to have the opportunity to film that last great story for episode 1 even if we're just finishing shooting for episode 6. Besides, who doesn't like to binge-watch TV these days?\nWHEN WILL IT BE DONE?\nWe are predicting 18 months from the finish of the Kickstarter campaign. That is roughly mid-July of 2015. The first six months will be pre-production (research, scheduling, travel arrangements, legal, insurance) and production (the actual shooting). Post-production (the period where we do all the editing, add in graphics, mix the sound, produce and edit a soundtrack, and so forth) will happen afterward. Kickstarter rewards will be designed and updates posted throughout the 18-month cycle.\nREWARDS\nWe are honored to be working with Humble Bundle and Fangamer for our backer rewards! They helped Double Fine Productions and Mighty No.9 on their Kickstarters, so you know we're working with the right folks to make sure you get your rewards on time and at the highest quality!\nBACKERS-ONLY LIVESTREAM - We will hold live streams at a secret URL that only Kickstarter backers will get access to. In it we'll show you stuff we've shot, rough edits of stories we're working on, and get your feedback on where to go next! We'll also trot out deleted scenes from past AREA 5 content. Watch purely for entertainment, or get more involved and help us shape the series! OUTERLANDERS UNITE!\nSOUNDTRACK (DIGITAL DOWNLOAD) - All the music used in the series! At the minimum this will include licensed tracks and original tracks from our collaborators, music created by AREA 5, and other original tunes. Help us hit our 100% ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK STRETCH GOAL, and we'll have the funding to commission ALL original music for the series!\nOUTERLANDS SEASON ONE (DIGITAL DOWNLOAD) - All finished episodes of the series in a handy download.\nOUTERLANDS SEASON ONE SPECIAL EDITION (DIGITAL DOWNLOAD)- All finished episodes of the series in a handy download, plus extra content like full interviews, stories that didn't make the cut for the main series, behind-the-scenes, and anything else we can think of that is interesting or awesome! We even have ideas for setting unused footage to music and presenting just for artistic value.\nPOSTER (DIGITAL DOWNLOAD) - A high-resolution PDF that you can print out at your leisure and use for your own purposes.\nSTICKERS - Quality stickers featuring carefully designed artwork inspired by the subjects featured in the Outlerlands episodes.\nPOSTER - Designed by one of our fabulous collaborators, this Kickstarter-only Outerlands poster will never be printed again!\nT-SHIRT - Designed by one of our fabulous collaborators, this Kickstarter-only Outerlands t-shirt will never be printed again!\nLIMITED EDITION T-SHIRT - A limited-run, ultra-high-quality design on the very best, super soft T-Shirts! NUMBERED! Show your support by backing early!\nLIMITED EDITION POSTERS - Extremely high-quality prints designed by Cory Schmitz on equally high-quality stock!\nSPECIAL EDITION BLU-RAY - There is no \"Regular Edition\" Blu-ray. Contains everything in the digital Special Edition plus a surprise or two! We feel it's silly to offer the Special Edition digital reward and have a Regular Edition Blu-ray at a higher cost. Yet another Cory Schmitz original, this will be a work of art designed for shelf display!\nTHE AREA 5 FILM FESTIVAL! - A one-day event where we rent out a theater, showcase AREA 5 films and other random, never-before-seen content (quite frankly, stuff we CAN'T show anywhere else), as well as a curated list of other videogame-themed films and shows. There will be food, drinks, and presentations from creators, cast, and documentary subjects in between the showings. VIP access means reserved seating and any other discounts or free stuff we can line up for the day of the event\u2014stuff we can't line up until funding is complete and the event is definitely on.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nWHO'S IN THE KICKSTARTER VIDEO?\nThis is where we get to thank the amazing people who have thus far lent us so much of their time and are such huge believers in this project! To Jim Guthrie and Disasterpeace for the music, and for our first documentary subjects!\nIf you're ever even somewhat close to Alameda, California, do yourself a favor and head out to High Scores Arcade Interactive Museum. All games are on free play and it's only $5 for an hour or $10 for a whole freakin' day! The owners, Meg and Shawn, are the coolest people ever! Also in the video are Mike Mika and Frank Cifaldi from Other Ocean Interactive. Besides being great game developers, Mike and Frank have made enormous efforts to preserve games and gaming culture. That shot of Frank looking at old slides is in Mike's famous basement that many of us first learned about on Robert Ashley's incredible podcast A Life Well Wasted. Our filming with Frank, Meg, Shawn, and Mike is far from complete, but we're already well into our production thanks to their tremendous help! We've also shot at the Oakland M.A.D.E. museum\u2014though it isn't featured explicitly in the Kickstarter video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur production schedule is set for roughly 18 months. That's a long time and a lot can happen in that period, but AREA 5 has been in business for 5 years and in that time we've finished dozens of productions. From full-length documentaries, to trailers, mini-docs, and fictional shorts. We know exactly what it'll take to protect ourselves and our content while making this series.\n\nThe main risks for any film project are accidents\u2014both to equipment and personnel. Of course we mitigate this as much as possible by taking out insurance as appropriate to every production, but that doesn't mean that catastrophic events can't occur that could cause us to lose some or all of our footage on a given trip to a foreign land. If this happens and our budget doesn't allow us a reshoot, we'll find other amazing stories to tell that will allow us to fulfill our promise to deliver the series on time.\n\nOther than losing content on location, we have a triple, multi-location backup plan for all our content. Short of San Francisco falling into the ocean, we should be covered.\n\nFinally\u2014and this one's a doozy\u2014we've heard tales of certain Kickstarters that have been funded and then had their largest backers deny/reverse the charges after the campaign is over. As you can imagine, this can be hugely devastating to a lean-and-mean documentary project. There's only so much contingency a budget can absorb before something has to slip.

The Collusion mobile app enhances board game play by pitting players against each other: sending secret messages and allowing players to scan tech cards to unlock additional game-changing advantages.\nIt\u2019s the late 1940\u2019s, WWII has ended ushering in a newer, coverter, colder war. Multiple countries now occupy Austria and no one has the intelligence they need. Government agents are using the city of Vienna as the quiet frontline battleground to carry out their various fact-finding missions...and assassinations, and whatnot.\nYou play as a Spy Master from one of several agencies. Your goal is to maximize your influence over the region at the expense of the other agencies. How you go about that is not important to your superiors - just don\u2019t get exposed!\nYou\u2019re aided by a super secret spy tech device not available to the general public - it\u2019s like a telephone, a camera, an Enigma machine and the ENIAC all rolled into a tiny wallet-sized package (in real-life it\u2019s your mobile device or tablet). Use this device to keep track of intel, accept missions, communicate with allies, hack into enemy agents\u2019 devices, and a bunch of other stuff that can be unlocked by acquiring tech.\nCollusion mandates lying, stealing, cheating, and murdering in order to win. Players must work together while simultaneously plotting against each other in order to gain influence over the region. Selling out an ally to an enemy, blackmailing an opponent, or paying another agent to carry out an assassination on your behalf is all in a day's work.\nYOUR OBJECTIVE \nAt the outset of the game, each player is given two possible ways to win. Any player can win by maximizing their own influence within the game. Alternatively, each player is given a secret opponent and is able to win by totally depleting their opponent's influence.\nDuring the game, you are able to monitor what your agency believes to be the current influence of each player via your phone.\nTHE BOARD\nThe board is made up of triangular tiles defining the city for that game. Players place their agents throughout the city using tokens. The location and arrangement of your agents will determine their ability to carry out your orders. Whether making an exchange, placing an explosive, or extorting information.\nMISSIONS\nThroughout the game, your HQ assigns you missions via your phone. And completing those missions determines your influence. But it isn\u2019t always black and white. HQ doesn\u2019t always know best, and sometimes the outcome of a mission isn\u2019t always desirable. You decide in the field how to handle what comes down the chain, who to help, and who to antagonize. Just be careful not to get burned\u2026\nCHEAT, JUST DON\u2019T GET CAUGHT\nFor spies, cheating is part of the job description. In fact, it\u2019s basically the entire job. So we\u2019ve embraced it. In Collusion, you\u2019re encouraged to cheat. Illegally trade cards. Take turns while someone is in the bathroom. Do whatever it takes to win\u2026 Unless you get caught. If you\u2019re noticed or called out, players use their in-game influence to democratically determine your guilt. And your punishment...\nNeed to secretly send a message to a \u201cfriend?\u201d CHECK!\nNeed to anonymously reveal disparaging intelligence against that very same \u201cfriend\u201d later on? CHECK!\nNeed to hack into another agent\u2019s mobile device to monitor their communications? CHECK!\nScan a tech card to enable the functionality on your mobile device\nA SMART BOARD GAME\nHaving a phone in the mix let\u2019s us bring some of the advantages of digital gaming to the table. The game uses an AI to manage parts of the game: because we know what cards all the players have, and how well they\u2019re doing in the game, we can strategically assign objectives and rebalance the game on an ongoing basis. We think this is remarkably badass.\nONE BOX, FOUR PLAYERS\nONLY ONE PLAYER HAS TO BUY THE GAME!\nThis is a big one: when you buy a board game and sit down with your friends to play, they don\u2019t have to buy the game too. We believe the same should be true for our mobile-enhanced game. Instead of each player buying the app, only the player who starts the game has to own a copy. Everyone else can download a free app and join any game they like.\nMOBILE ONLY VERSION\nWe figure we\u2019re already building a mobile game as part of the project, might as well make it work with just your phone as well! To start, we\u2019ll offer a simpler version that you can play with your friends (same principle as above: only one player needs to own it). Initially, this will just be for local games, so you\u2019ll all have to be in the same room. But one of our big stretch goals is to broaden the game play to have something playable over the \u2018net.\nGOING DARK\nAnd if a player doesn\u2019t have a phone, or yours runs out of batteries in the middle of the game, a set of \u201cGoing Dark\u201d cards contain various rogue-agent missions for you to complete, even without a connection to your headquarters. We wouldn\u2019t play if nobody had a phone, but the dark cards offer a fun way to join, or an interesting strategy if you find your phone getting hacked a bit too much...\nThanks to Kickstarter we can see if everyone is interested in this idea before we have to go make the final thing. Once the campaign ends, we have to finish the game design, produce art assets for the printed materials, send everything to be manufactured, and simultaneously build the mobile versions of the game. \nWe'll use the money raised to cover the initial costs of production and app development, but more importantly be able to buy some inventory to distribute later\u2014without this, we will be unable to sell more copies of the game than are ordered on Kickstarter, and Collusion will disappear as quickly as it came to exist. Setting the goal at $100,000 means we'll produce enough copies of the game to have a meaningful distribution. Even though we could produce the game for less. \nTHE PRODUCT\nA professionally produced 3-4 player tile-based board game with scannable intel and tech cards\nAn Android app\nAn iOS app\nA print-and-play version of the board game\nA simplified mobile-only version of the game - in case you want to play a quick round with your mates on the bus but didn\u2019t bring your board...or just prefer a mobile-only version of the game. \n Informant ($5 limit 100)\nThe mobile game \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nEarly-bird price! \nField Agent ($10)\nThe mobile game \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nDouble Agent ($50 limit 100)\nThe mobile game \nThe board game \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nEarly-bird price! \nSpecial Agent ($65)\nThe mobile game \nThe board game \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nSpy Master ($75)\nThe mobile game \nThe board game \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nAccess to the development blog Early beta access \nThe ability to vote on future features \nHigh Roller \u2013 Tile Art ($500 limit 20)\nThe mobile game \nThe board game \nBeautiful laser-cut wood board game tiles (instead of cardboard) \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nAccess to the development blog \nEarly beta access \nThe ability to vote on future features \nProducer credit \nA signed, original artist drawing of one of the board game tiles \nHigh Roller \u2013 Card Art ($500 limit 20)\nThe mobile game\nThe board game\nBeautiful laser-cut wood board game tiles (instead of cardboard) \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nAccess to the development blog \nEarly beta access \nThe ability to vote on future features Producer credit \nA signed, original artist drawing of one of the playing cards \nAffluent Dignitary ($1000)\nThe mobile game \nThe board game \nBeautiful laser-cut wood board game tiles (instead of cardboard) \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nAccess to the development blog \nEarly beta access \nThe ability to vote on future features \nProducer credit \nThe exclusive affluent dignitary tech upgrade enabling you to use your social status to make in-game 'problems' disappear \nMinister of Intelligence ($5000 limit 5)\nThe mobile game \nThe board game \nBeautiful laser-cut wood board game tiles (instead of cardboard) \nThe print-and-play version of the board game \nAccess to the development blog \nEarly beta access \nThe ability to vote on future features \nProducer credit \nThe exclusive affluent dignitary tech upgrade enabling you to use your social status to make in-game 'problems' disappear \nWe will rent a room at Cafe Mox in Seattle and have game night with you and your pals.

But something is severely missing! The magic is lost on the screen when you push your \u201cwood\u201d scrabble tiles around with the tip of your finger. And following the rules to the letter in digital boardgames leaves out the fun of \u201chouse rules.\u201d We want to make a digital board game, that is still a board game at heart.\nWe've been designing and building software for big and little companies for a while.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are definitely a number of risky bits associated with producing a product like this. \n\nBridging the analog/digital divide is challenging. Playing a board game where you stare at your phone the whole time is no fun. We're aware that there are challenges here and are actively designing the game to keep the focus on the other players. Rigorous design and play testing will help us keep the game exciting and socially enjoyable.\n\nManufacturing the board game on a schedule can be problematic as the actual manufacturing process of the board game is outside our immediate control. Delays in manufacturing, customs, or proofing can result in delays in shipping which would make every one of us sad pandas.\n\nSoftware feature creep can also derail a release if left unchecked. We have a good development schedule and attainable app features given the timeframe, so we\u2019re not too worried about shipping the mobile app on schedule. We've also been designing and building digital things for big companies for years.

Thank you, everyone! Thank you, MailChimp!\nThanks to the 10,500+ of you who make this show possible. We received the extra $20,000 grant from MailChimp because of an incredible surge of support on Thursday. I\u2019ve long since run out of clever ways to express my gratitude. I have new empathy for the greeting card writers of the world.\nIf you\u2019ve been following along, you\u2019ll notice a pattern in the stretch goals of this campaign: fixing what's broken in the public radio system. Don't get me wrong-- I do this work because I love it, and it has been my privilege to be an independent radio producer for more than a dozen years. I am extremely lucky that I get to do this for a living.\nHowever, there are things about the public radio system that need to change. One by one, our stretch goals have been addressing these issues. You\u2019ve proven that the audience will reward innovation. You\u2019ve provided health care stipends to our contract workers. You\u2019ve ended the endless internship. It has been amazing to watch these goals get shattered so quickly, because I always knew that the right audience would consider these things to be important.\nThe time has come to replicate this across public radio. We\u2019re creating Radiotopia.\nFor a couple years, I\u2019ve been scheming with PRX to create a collective of exceptional radio shows that will push the boundaries of public radio. Modeled after 99% Invisible, we want to provide support for a select group of creator-driven, high-quality, entrepreneurial programs that will establish a path to success for the most talented audio producers. We call it Radiotopia.*\nThe most common question I\u2019m asked, by far, is \u201cWhat other podcasts do you listen to?\u201d There are great ones out there and I want more. The hardest part of creating a new show is getting started and then getting enough audience and support to move into regular production. We want to provide a platform where the best producers can find an audience and flourish. That has always been my ultimate goal, and it\u2019s time to get it done.\nSo here's the plan: pledges collected up to the $350,000 mark will go towards rounding out the 99pi 2014 budget: relocation money for our next hire, raising freelance rates, creating an experimental fund for us to try things that we haven't thought of yet, and also buying some new equipment (Avery is using Sam's computer from college and most of our gear is older than my boys).\nAnything pledged beyond that threshold--$350,000--will go toward establishing a seed fund for programs in PRX\u2019s Radiotopia.\nCreating this support network helps 99% Invisible achieve long-term sustainability, and everyone will benefit from more great radio in the world. I kept thinking that an ecosystem of other 99% Invisibles would spring up after our initial success, and a few have, but not nearly enough. And the few programs out there are in constant risk of going away without a network to support them. So, let\u2019s build it ourselves.\n-roman\n*The term \u201cradiotopia\u201d came from Julie Shapiro when she was at the Third Coast International Audio Festival. Many of the most creative, independent producers of public radio get together every year at the Third Coast Conference to find our community and explore our craft. Julie called this gathering and all the great plans we had for audio storytelling \u201cradiotopia.\u201d It\u2019s a place where everything is radio and everything is really good.\nStretch Goals:\nOver $350,000- Start the Radiotopia program fund.\nOver $400,000- Respect.\nOver $500,000- Mad respect.\n$590,808- Take down Planet Money as the highest-funded podcast on Kickstarter.\n99% Invisible is a popular public radio show and podcast about design, architecture and all the thought that goes into the things most people don\u2019t even think about.\nThe show started as a side project I made in my bedroom at night, and after two years of making the program, I turned to Kickstarter to see if I should keep it going. To my great surprise, the Season 3 fund-raising campaign broke all previous records for a journalism project on Kickstarter. We hired a producer (Sam Greenspan!), overhauled the website, grew the audience, and made the show better than it has ever been.\nFor Season 4, we want to Kickstart the next giant leap in the evolution of 99% Invisible:\nWe want to go weekly.\nWe're staffing up and going pro. This involves hiring more help (contract reporters, editors, a production coordinator, paid interns), moving into a proper office, and commissioning more stories. The 52 weekly episodes of Season 4 will start February 4, 2014 and run for one year.\nWe are making a new kind of public radio in a new way. I must admit, after the huge success and growth of the show in the last year, I thought the public radio decision-makers and granting institutions would really get behind 99% Invisible, but they are slow to act. It's OK, their deliberate nature is part of why we love them, but it means it is up to you to tell us if we should expand and make more. This is as public as public radio gets.\nOur dream is to hire Sean Cole as a monthly contributor. Not only is he the best reporter in public radio, he also produced one of our favorite 99% Invisible stories, \"Some Other Sign That People Do Not Totally Regret Life.\"\nREWARDS\nT-Shirts!\nOur awesome new shirts were designed by Chop Shop and they will be fulfilling the t-shirt orders. We are only guaranteeing that they will arrive by January, but we will do everything in our power to get t-shirts to you by Christmas. After the campaign is over, you will get a Kickstarter survey that collects your t-shirt size and address.

Each with black line artwork and a one color accent layer. Final version may vary from what is pictured below. Each notebook contains 32 pages of grid-lined paper.\nDazzle Pocket Notebook\nHeyoon Pocket Notebook\nSecret Staircases Pocket Notebook\nPosters!\nSteve McCarthy created a brilliant new poster/desktop image that combines a bunch of our favorite things on one stunning map.

An underwriting partnership with 99% Invisible will demonstrate that your company is very passionate about all aspects of design. During this campaign, underwriting spots are discounted and have lots of bonus prizes and goodies. Get in touch and we will work out all the details: roman@prx.org\nCustom Recording\nAs part of the \"Two-of-everything\" pack, I'll record something unique for you. It could be an outgoing voicemail message, or a favorite short story, video narration, anything under 30 minutes that doesn't make me cringe (I reserve the right to refuse the recording on moral or ethical grounds--e.g. I won't record the narration for your racist cult recruiting video). This is only for non-commercial use. Last year, people used this prize to great effect. I voiced cool videos for The Noun Project and Sing Statistics.\nProducer for a day\nPick from a couple dozen potential days (we'll make something work) and we'll invite you into the 99% Invisible production. You'll sit in on a story meeting, critique whatever rough draft we have in process, go out to lunch (probably for pho, we love pho), and just hang out all day. Plus, you'll take home all the swag you see on this page. You just need to get yourself to Oakland.\nMusic\nThe music in the video is courtesy of two great bands I love, Melodium and Les Savy Fav. Melodium has inspired more of my radio stories than any other artist in existence and Les Savy Fav is quite simply the greatest rock n' roll band alive. If you have spare money after this campaign, go buy an album or two.

This feature-length documentary, a work-in-progress aiming for 2014 release, is meant to be used an engine for all of us that think change is needed and possible. The film will investigate the politics that keep the car model thriving. Here's a peak into the synopsis:\nThere\u2019s an ongoing war: bikes vs cars. A multi-billion dollar industry that from early days has done everything to make society car dependent. Hundreds of billions of dollars are invested every year to sell the dream of car freedom. Now, oil prices and traffic gridlock have opened up room for bicycle revenge. Creative initiatives pop up, politicians and activists take on the mighty car. The car lobbyists have an enormous impact on city planning, in history and today. Do politicians dare to challenge the lobbyists?                                      \nActivists in car-booming S\u00e3o Paulo honor a killed bicyclist with a ghostbike.\nThe film will follow individuals around the world that are fighting to create change. We also meet a car commercial director, oil lobbyists and politicians afraid to lose the car owner's vote.\nDirector Fredrik Gertten and friends. Photo: Michel Thomas\nA note from director Fredrik Gertten\n\"I was born in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, a city where the bike is the natural choice for going from one place to another. I\u2019ve traveled the world wondering why there is so little space for bikes, why it's so dangerous when it's so much more fun to explore a city by bike.  The car model as we know it has reached an extreme level with constant gridlock and millions of productive hours lost. The frustration is growing and cities need to look into new models. \nThe urban biking movement is growing. Beginning just for the passion, the freedom on the bike, it has evolved into a political movement asking for better city-planning, safe and separate bike lanes. We also suffer from the the anxiety of climate change, but we are at least doing something about it. In Copenhagen and Amsterdam forty percent commute within the city on bikes. Try to adopt that number to other huge cities in the world and you have an existing utopia.\nIn Copenhagen, 40 percent commute on bike every day. Imagine the climate effect if other cities reached the same numbers.\nWhat would happen to car sales and oil usage if other cities followed that example? It would be revolutionary. And here's the conflict. The car industry is at the center of our economic system. They have money and investments to lose. For the car owners and commuters that have become so invested in their lifestyle, a change is painful. It\u2019s a conflict that interests me. That's why I\u2019ve decided to take on this project. A project of passion.\nI am proud to be part of a growing global movement. I hope that everyone that takes part in this campaign will feel the the same and happily jump on their bikes, spread the word and donate.\"\nWE ARE MANY\nWe would love to be a Kickstarter documentary campaign with many backers. Maybe not the largest amount of money, but in number of people. Because we believe that we are many that want a change. So help us show that WE ARE MANY. Even a small amount is a statement. \nThe 50 000 USD we are asking for is needed for the post-production and outreach of the film and it\u2019s message. The post-production stage is when we finally get to put all of the footage we've collected together. Edit it, add music to it, add subtitles. These things all take a lot of time and money, but are essential for presenting you with a strong, effective documentary. Once we're finished, we want to get it out to as wide of an audience as possible, which requires a lot of reaching out! Not only on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, but also to film festivals, distribution companies, tv channels etc. This documentary is addressing a very global issue, so we want people around the world to get a chance to see it!\nWe also have exciting plans for bikes-vs-cars.com where we are working on more interactive content, like an app for measuring the change you make by going by bike, which will visualize how we together make a big difference. With more money and a larger community, we can be more ambitious in engaging with the audience and creating buzz around the issue. Playing a small part in changing the world.\nBIKES vs CARS Kickstarter video\nREWARDS\nIt's not too late to sign up for a Bike Date!\nDiscover a city by bike.

There are still many aspects that will be modified before the \"gold\" release, estimated to launch in March 2014.\nNote that this free version will be available only for the duration of the Kickstarter campaign. Anyone who buys the game will also gain access to the alpha and beta. You can start playing the game right now and if you back us, you'll be able to keep on playing for as long as you want.\n\nPress quotes\n\"GoD Factory Wingmen was one of the more interesting titles I checked out at PAX\"\n- TotalBiscuit\n\"Quite how multiplayer space-combat dogfighters vs capital-ship game GoD Factory: Wingmen hasn\u2019t raised the mere $70,000 Kickstarter ask is beyond me.\"\n- Jim Rossignol, Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"The first game in 15 years that's going to make me buy a joystick for my PC\"\n- James Portnow, Extra Credits\n\"Two of the hottest things in gaming right now are MOBAs and the Oculus Rift. When you take those two things and whip in a spicy dash of sci-fi space combat, it's hard not to get a tad excited. To the point of twitching.\"\n- Jarimor, ZAM\n\"There is nothing simple about GoD Factory. I got my first taste of the game at Pax East 2013, and I can truthfully say that the game is as deep as it is beautiful.\"\n- Alex Coccia, GreenlitGaming\n\"The space shooter genre has been sorely missing in action since the critically acclaimed X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter in the early 90's. After my time with GoD Factory at PAX East, I think GoD Factory is as close as we've come to that experience since so many years ago.\"\n- Dave Voyles, former Armless Octopus Managing Editor\nWhat is GoD Factory: Wingmen?\nGoD Factory: Wingmen is played through fast-paced and intensely tactical 4 vs 4 player matches, where the aim is to destroy the enemy's 13km long Carrier before it wrecks yours; all under the relentless fire of enemy players and point-defense turrets.\nYou play as mercenary pilots who constantly improve and customize their gunships between battles. Completing a match earns you credits according to your performance, which are used to purchase increasingly powerful and exotic parts.\nThere are 4 playable species in GoD Factory: the ruthless Humans, the wise Guantris, the gigantic Chorions and the unnatural Ar. They each have unique ship designs, both visually and gameplay-wise. Players choose and start with two of those species and can unlock the other two during the course of their career.\nVote for us on Greenlight!\nThis is primarily a PC game, but we're also trying to bring the game to consoles. We will also have Mac and Linux versions, with the ability to play with your friends no matter what OS they are using. You'll be happy to know that this game is not hardware intensive, so if you have a decent PC, even if it's a few years old, it should be able to run the game. We are working hard to make GoD Factory:Wingmen accessible to as many players as we can, without sacrificing the beauty of the visuals. We're already able to run the game quite decently on 5 years old laptops, so we're pretty confident that we'll be supporting a wide range of computers.\nKey Features:\nMETHODICAL DESTRUCTION\nTo win a match, you and your team must wreck the enemy Carrier's components. Each one that your team destroys cripples the enemy players in unique ways; wrecking their Carrier's Radar reduces their detection range, for example. Which Carrier parts your team destroys, as well as the destruction order, is one of the most important parts of the game.\nESSENTIAL COOPERATION\nTeam play is your most powerful weapon. Taking down the massive carriers or finishing off an isolated enemy player requires concerted effort. Well organized teams can even trigger powerful elemental combos on their targets by firing complementary weapons.\nGAME-CHANGING ABILITIES\nGunships come equipped with a great number of special abilities. Ranging from teleportation to the creation of holographic decoys, GoD Factory offers a deep tactical gameplay that's light-years beyond simply firing your weapons until the target explodes.\nDOUBLE GUNSHIPS\nUniquely to GoD Factory, you do not bring a single machine to the battlefield. Rather you build and use two gunships in each match. Each gunship is made from 12 different category of parts, so a player chooses 24 different parts to bring to a match. In addition, players can borrow their teammates' gunships and try different builds.\nVISIT YOUR SHIP DEALER\nWith over 1000 different gunship parts, you can precisely tailor your ships to your playstyle and to your team's strategy. Buying a part belonging to one species may unlock it for other species, letting the player mix and match a variety of normally separate parts. A player can also customize the colors his ship with a high degree of control.\nOCULUS AND JOYSTICK SUPPORT\nGoD Factory allows players with special hardware to have an even more immersive experience. A first person cockpit view is available to all players, but is particularly enjoyable with the Oculus Rift. The game also support a wide variety of gamepads and controls schemes.\nA good game isn't just a set of features however, it's an experience, and it has to be approached like one. We're orienting ourselves on four key aspects of the experience that we'd like to deliver:\n(Taken straight from the Game Design Document!)\nCreate\nThe player wants to feel that he's doing his own thing. He's crafting a ship that fits his preferences, he works on making a play style and strategy of his own. He wants to build his squad by joining like-minded players. Everything must come with a sense of ownership.\nFly\nWe need to convey a sense of mobility to the player. He must be picturing himself moving into a 3D space with both skill and freedom, the ability to go wherever he feels like. The movement of the ship and the camera must give to players the reflex to tilt their heads to follow their ship's motion. They want to feel \u201cthere\u201d.\nCooperate\nAny player wants to feel like he's playing an important part in his team. In order to do so, we must reward every actions done as a group and make sure that victory is achieved when everyone acts toward a common goal. In order to convince the player to be a team player, he must feel the presence of his allies in the fight.\nImprove\nAn aspect that will hook our players is the strong sense of progression when playing the game. Not only will his ships become better as he plays, but learning the complex systems and the meta-game will always give him something more to learn. One reason to keep playing is that you always get better.\nIt also helps that we have a very talented team to make the visuals of the game. Etienne Vanier, our lead artist, made a short video on the artistic direction of the game, showing how much thought and care we've put in it.\nThe Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset that was immensely successful here on Kickstarter. VR replaces your vision by the environment of the game by placing monitors in front of each eye. Motion tracking and stereoscopic 3D make this even more convincing.\nOculus Rift is not ideal for every game because it completely replaces your vision. For a game with a character that walks and jumps, it can feel a bit awkward as the player is sitting in a chair. However the experience from GoD: Wingmen is within a cockpit, creating the perfect environment for simulation.\nIt is our intent to support the Oculus Rift for GoD Factory and we hope that we'll be ready on time for launch.\nNine Dots is a team of 7 developers working full time. We've got two programmers, three artists, one game designer/studio manager and a recently added game designer. Most of us have been working on this game for a year now with no salary. Before that, we had worked on a different game, Brand for over a year, also with no salary. So needless to say, we're a bunch of extremely committed developers doing all we can to make a great games!\nThe team and some loved ones :-)\nNine Dots was created to fight back against management practices from the game industry which we think are holding us back. We want to change how we make games, and what games we make. We are vehemently against crunch time, we believe in building our own intellectual properties rather than working on the projects of others and we make sure that everyone has a meaningful creative input on the game. If you want to read more about this mission, we were featured in a related article on the Penny Arcade Report not long ago.\nWe are giving everything we have to make this project a reality. However, sometimes that's not enough. We have a very solid alpha, which was thoroughly enjoyed by hundreds over hundreds of people during PAX East.\nHowever, we might be unable to bring the game to completion. We've been working for 2 years at Nine Dots now, without salary. Our personal savings and resources are spreading thin, and even though we haven't paid ourselves salaries, we still have business related bills to pay. We have to pay for insurances, rent, licenses and many other things to sustain the business. We are surviving on a $25,000 bank loan, but that won't suffice.\nWe need to buy music and sound effects, we need enough to pay the office rent and other day-to-day expenditures, we need funds for marketing (such as going to conventions, some banner space, trailers, travels, etc) and of course we need some money ourselves as developers to stay afloat. We'll start selling the game right after this kickstarter, but it will be an incomplete version. We still have work until probably March of 2014 before we're done implementing all the core features we'd want for the game. We intend to deliver a steady flow of updates but that requires resources, and that's where backers come in.\nAll our backers will also be thanked in the game's credits.\nPledge $1 or more: Supporter\nPledge $15 or more: Early Bird\nPledge $20 or more: Rookie Pilot\nAnyone who makes a pre-order of the game also buys his way into the alpha that will be released in October. You also get an exclusive cosmetic addition only available to backers: a Wing Lamp that adds a flare effect in front of your ship.\nPledge $30 or more: Certified Pilot\nWe made four unique ships, one for each species, available only to kickstarter backers and early buyers (but Kickstarter backers get it at a discount). These ships are made from the three major visual ship parts, which are the wings, the hull and the cockpit.\nWe also add to the mix a highly reflective, unique \"Super-Copper\" material that you can apply to any of your ships.\nPledge $50 or more: True Wingman\nGet 4 licenses, so that you may share the game with your friends. They will all have access to the alpha and beta.\nYou also get the exclusive \"Super-Silver\" material to apply to your ship and a vanity item that will add a blazing fire to your trails. \nPledge $100 or more: Veteran Wingman\nNot only do you get all the previous rewards, you also get all future expansions and DLC to the game. We intend to support the game for a while and frequently update with new content, and it will all be available to you without spending one dime more. You also get all 4 unique ships, and the unique super-gold material to apply to your ship.\nPledge $250 or more: Galactic Superstar\nThere are big billboards on space stations and satellites that will appear in some level environments. These billboards will shuffle through a bank of images. You get to provide us with an image of your choice (we need to approve of the image first) and your image will be displayed on those billboards. You would like to promote your own game? You want to make a joke to make our players laugh? You like kittens? Show it on our billboards!\nYou also get a vanity item that alters your ship by adding bigDiamond gemsto your ship.\nPledge $400 or more: The Astronomer\nYou get to design your own stellar Constellation, which all players will see in the sky surrounding the battlefield. You will have a maximum of 12 stars for your constellation. Note that not every constellation will necessarily appear at the same time in every match.\nYou will also get a Vanity Item that produces an Ornate Luminous Haloon your ship.\nPledge $1000 or more: The Terraformer\nFor this amount, you can either design a custom Planet that will be up for everyone to see in the game *or* a custom Vanity Item, similar to the other vanity rewards such as fire trails, diamond chunks, star flares in front of your wings, etc. Tell us what you'd like to see, if it's reasonable we'll do it. We won't do anything offensive or which concerns intellectual properties we do not own the rights to. The planet will not appear in every match and will be one of the randomly shuffled level element.\nPledge $2000 or more: Patron of the GoDly arts\nDesign a GoD Monument (instead of a Planet or a Vanity Item), which are absolutely ASTRONOMICAL statues or monuments. These colossi have a big visual impact on levels, even more so than planets or space stations, and will usually be the main piece in a level environment. Just like the planet, the GoD Monument will not appear in every match. It will be one of the random elements that composes a level's environment. Believe us, all players take notice when a GoD is there. In some cases, we might even be able to animate the GoD monument, depending on the complexity of the concept.\nPledge $5000 or more: Fleet Admiral\nDesign a new Carrier Cannon (instead of a planet, vanity item or GoD) This cannon will have its own unique shape and projectile special FX. You also choose whether this cannon will only appear on your side when you're part of a match, or if every player in the game has access to it.\nPledge $8000 or more: The Omnipotent\nFor this much, we actually make a game that will be available in our game. In the Crew Quarter menu, where a player can see his stats, trophies and codex entries, there will be an arcade cabinet which can be selected to play a game. This game will be your idea, which must not take more than 2 weeks to make. We'll discuss this at length to make sure it ends up being something you're satisfied with, but you need to have realistic expectations. This arcade cabinet will be available for any player to try.\n___________________\nWe are open to suggestions if there are other rewards you'd like to see. Note however that we want to stay away as much as possible from physical goods, as they take a LOT of resources, both in time and money, and that would detract us from our commitment to make the very best game we can.\nWe need your help, and the simple fact that you're here reading this, that you've spent time considering our project or watched the video means a lot to us. If you like what we are doing but can't afford to contribute at the moment, know that you can help us a lot by simply talking about us and sharing our Kickstarter. We're very grateful for this kind of help as well and we know all too well that sometimes you're just strapped for cash and can't help this way.\nNow let's make GoD Factory: Wingmen a reality, shall we?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nConsidering that we've been working on GoD Factory for over a year with no salary, I think it's pretty safe to think we can bring this project to completion if we get the cash and the support we need from our backers.

We are ready, more than ever, to take on this challenge.\n\nWe have no intention of dropping the ball. Our entire company is dedicated to this project. We're betting the farm on this project, we can't allow it to fail. So we'll do everything we can to be successful and worthy of your support.\n\nWith all that being said, it is possible that we'd delay the game and/or some rewards.

It's up to you to keep your everyone together or at least mostly alive in the middle of bickering, personality conflicts, despair, rage, and/or insanity.\nWe have the rarely seen classic \"death metaphor\" style of zombie. They're slow, they're stupid, there's up to 200 onscreen at once, and they'll never stop chasing you. They form a shambling wall of inevitable death that will drag you down.\nRarer survivors called Uniques, that have their own special events, appearance, and dialogue.\nFind a dog, teach it to drive. Have all the humans in your party die. Make the dog recruit other dogs until your band of survivors consists of 5 dogs driving a muscle car.\nDeath Road to Canada is coming out around the end of Fall 2013. We want it have as much content as possible, and we want it our PC/Mac/Linux launch to go smoothly. Your support means we can put extra resources into accomplishing these goals, especially the \"more content\" part.\nFunds are specifically going to:\nMORE ART: We throw more money at our artist and he magically converts it to new graphics. Even more survivor and zombie variety! More city variety! New special locations! More dog types!\nMORE RARE EVENTS: Paul, our programmer, has four kids to feed. Some extra money to feed his five kids would give him the peace of mind he needs to work on extra fun stuff. Rare events! Rare weapons! Rare characters! Easter Eggs!\nMORE PROMOTION: I want to show the game off at festivals, as doing so really helps getting the word out. Travel costs, much less booth costs, are really expensive. A small portion of your support will go towards this, but not much because I don't want to be responsible for taking food from Paul's six kids.\nMORE FLEXIBILITY: Funding would give us the option of hiring a part-time programmer to help out. Or a part-time writer/designer to help make more Interactive Fiction scenarios and decisions. Your support would help us hire any extra help we end up needing.\n(IF WE GO OVER) MORE FREE UPDATES: If we exceed $25,000, we want to avoid Stretch Goals that will increase the complexity of the project and the time it takes to make the game. This is known to game developers as Kickstarter's Folly. Instead, we will put extra money into providing post-release content. This will be a mixture of extra content and feature requests from the community!\nHere's some details on what you can get for backing Death Road to Canada. All rewards are cumulative, you get all the lower tier rewards if you pledge to a higher tier.\nThe Game ($10) - A copy of the game when it releases, on PC, Linux, and Mac! Mobile versions aren't included, as the Android port will take longer and iOS codes are generally limited to 50 or so. You'll also get access to news updates exclusive to Kickstarter, including exclusive polls about game content!\nSoundtrack and Manual PDF ($25) - We'll be making a cool instruction manual in PDF format. It'll have tips, art, a strategy section, and various fun stuff. You'll also get all the music used in the game.\nEarly Access ($30) - Play the PC, Mac, or Linux version of the game about a month before it's out to the public! You'll be given access to a forum where you can send feedback directly to the developers of the game. Help us make the game even better.\nStarter Pet Option ($50) - Only available to Kickstarter backers of this tier or higher, you get the option to start the game with a kitten or puppy. They take extra food, but provide a morale boost and grow into a full sized cat or dog.\nSpecial Thanks ($75) - Everyone who pledges at this tier or above will have their names put in a Special Thanks section of the game's credits. Your first name will also be added to the big list of names that randomly generated survivors may use.\nOfficial Death Road to Canada T-Shirt ($100) - Designed by the game's artist. May or may not unlock hidden secrets if you play the game while wearing the shirt.\nGraffiti Message ($250) - Write a short message and we'll put it in the game for other players to find at random. We'll work with you so it fits within the game. Size would be about 200 characters big, maximum. $150 if you get it through the limited Early Bird tier.\nPut Your Pet in the Game ($500) - Take a picture or video of your pet, write a description of it along with its name. We'll make it so that other players can randomly find and recruit your pet into their party. Unusual pets are ok, put your ferret in the game. We'll work with you so it fits within the game design.\nAbandoned Journal ($1000) - Players can find small, abandoned journals to read that tells the story about the person that wrote them. Write a story, write poetry, write crazy top 10 lists. We'll work with you on having it fit the tone of the game. Size would be about 1200 characters big, maximum.\nDesign a Recruitable Character ($2000) - The big one! Put a version of yourself in the game, or dream up an all new character. Other players may rarely find and recruit your character into their groups. You specify your character's appearance and possible special traits. We'll work with you on having it be a good fit in the game world, and also include your character in some of the dialogue and events.\nKepa Auwae is the lead designer of Rocketcat Games, makers of Mage Gauntlet, Hook Champ, Punch Quest (a collaboration with Madgarden), and more.

I wanted to build it in the USA. So The Roost was designed from the ground up to be producible at medium-to-high quantities from equipment that one can run in a small production area. \nThe solution involves innovative manufacturing approaches using off-the-shelf components, a laser cutter, and hand-pressed rivets. No Plastic Injection molds were used in making the Roost. Half of the fun was finding innovative materials and processes to meet my manufacturing plan.\nKickstarter will be used to fund the manufacturing equipment purchase of the laser cutter, rivet dies and squeezers, mechanical presses, and other shop equipment. If the kickstarter is successful, the Roost factory will be well-equipped to produce medium-to-high volumes of Roosts for years to come!\nThe Roost is patent pending.\n______________________________________________________________\nDesign Highlights\nProblem: Getting your laptop screen to the correct height is inherently precarious because it will be at least a foot off the desk.  \nSolution: Using an innovative way of suspending the laptop from the base of the screen (as opposed to the conventional method of resting the laptop on a surface), The Roost literally \u201cclips in\u201d to your laptop to hold it extremely securely.  It is as stable as if your laptop were sitting on the desk.\nProblem: For the product to truly be useful, the product must be highly collapsible to fit into your bag / briefcase / backpack / etc.\nSolution: \nUsing two mechanical mechanisms: 1) a \u201cscissor lift\u201d that construction workers use to lift themselves 50+ feet off the ground combined with 2) the action of a conventional folding chair, The Roost holds laptops of any weight and greater than 13\u201d screen size, and folds down into a highly compact 1\u201d x 1.5\u201d x 13\u201d shape.\nProblem: The Roost must be extremely durable because it will be tossed around with your travel gear.\nSolution:\nThe Roost - Holding 132lbs of cinder blocks\nConstructed from Carbon Fiber and Delrin plastic, two of the toughest modern materials, the Roost was over designed to outlive your laptop.\n______________________________________________________________\n\nWho is using the Roost?\nBroadly, anyone who uses a laptop:\nCreative professionals, especially those that travel / work on location\nDesigners, Graphic Artists, Video Editors, Producers\nDJs, performing artists, musicians\nPhotographers\nWriters, Reporters, Social Media\nDevelopers / programmers\nStudents\nConsultants\nSales professionals\nGamers\n\nOther Uses:\niPad / Tablet Stand\nBook Stand\nSpecial Thanks:\nJelani Memory for his amazing video production work\nBlack Shirt Brewing Co, Denver, CO.

To the point of twitching.\"\n - Jarimor, ZAM\n\"There is nothing simple about GoD Factory. I got my first taste of the game at Pax East 2013, and I can truthfully say that the game is as deep as it is beautiful.\"\n - Alex Coccia, GreenlitGaming\nWhat is GoD Factory: Wingmen?\nGoD Factory: Wingmen is a multiplayer space combat game in which the player works with a team of up to three other players to destroy the opponent\u2019s Carrier while defending their own.\nBefore joining online matches, the player assembles two gunships by individually selecting the twelve parts that compose each ship. These parts are bought from the game's shop using Credits earned by playing games online. Once in-game, the players must destroy different key areas of the enemy Carrier to incapacitate it and ultimately destroy it. Destroying a Carrier part gives penalties to the enemy team, and each broken part inflicts a different penalty. The key to victory will be to work as a team and many weapons and abilities will have secondary uses that can only be triggered by joining up with other players. A game should last about 15 minutes on average and can't stretch beyond 25 minutes. The game will be playable both in third person, to see your ship you've built, or from inside the cockpit, for greater immersion.\nVote for us on Greenlight!\nThis is primarily a PC game, but we're very open to the possibility of bringing the game to consoles if the opportunity arises. We will also have a Mac version, but it might not be available at launch. Linux is also a possibility, but no promise as of yet. Anyhow, you'll be happy to know that this game is not hardware intensive, so if you have a decent PC, even if it's a few years old, it should be able to run the game. We are working hard to make GoD Factory:Wingmen accessible to lots of people can play this game, without sacrificing the beauty of the visuals. We're already able to run the game quite decently on 5 years old laptops, so we're pretty confident that we'll be supporting a wide range of PCs.\nKey features:\nMany different gunship classes and parts to choose from;\nBuild 2 gunships and lend the one you're not using to your teammates or keep it for later; \nDifferent weapons and abilities are amplified by cooperating with your allies; \nDestroy the enemy Carrier part by part, taking away its abilities progressively; \nComplex weapon attributes provide a wide array of strategies to experiment.\n\n\nA good game isn't just a set of features however, it's an experience, and it has to be approached like one. We're orienting ourselves on four key aspects of the experience that we'd like to deliver:\n(Taken straight from the Game Design Document!)\n\nCreate: \nThe player wants to feel that he's doing his own thing. He's crafting a ship that fits his preferences, he works on making a play style and strategy of his own. He wants to build his squad by joining like-minded players. Everything must come with a sense of ownership.\n\nFly: \nWe need to convey a sense of mobility to the player. He must be picturing himself moving into a 3D space with both skill and freedom, the ability to go wherever he feels like. The movement of the ship and the camera must give to players the reflex to tilt their heads to follow their ship's motion. They want to feel \u201cthere\u201d.\n\nCooperate: \nAny player wants to feel like he's playing an important part in his team. In order to do so, we must reward every actions done as a group and make sure that victory is achieved when everyone acts toward a common goal. In order to convince the player to be a team player, he must feel the presence of his allies in the fight.\n\nImprove: \nAn aspect that will hook our players is the strong sense of progression when playing the game. Not only will his ships become better as he plays, but learning the complex systems and the meta-game will always give him something more to learn. One reason to keep playing is that you always get better.\nThe Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset that was immensely successful here on Kickstarter. VR replaces your vision by the environment of the game by placing monitors in front of each eye. Motion tracking and stereoscopic 3D make this even more convincing. \nOculus Rift is not ideal for every game because it completely replaces your vision.  For a game with a character that moves and jumps, it can feel a bit awkward as the player is sitting in a chair.  However the experience from GoD: Wingmen is within a cockpit, creating the perfect environment for simulation.\nIt is our intent to support the Oculus Rift for GoD Factory and we hope that we'll be ready on time for launch.\nNine Dots is a team of 7 developers working full time. We've got two programmers, three artists, one game designer/studio manager and a recently added game designer. Most of us have been working on this game for a year now with no salary. Before that, we had worked on a different game, Brand for over a year, also with no salary. So needless to say, we're a bunch of extremely committed developers doing all we can to make a great games!\nNine Dots was created to fight back against management practices from the game industry which we think are holding us back. We want to change how we make games, and what games we make. We are vehemently against crunch time, we believe in building our own intellectual properties rather than working on the projects of others and we make sure that everyone has a meaningful creative input on the game. If you want to read more about this mission, we were featured in a related article on the Penny Arcade Report not long ago: http://penny-arcade.com/report/article/why-your-games-are-made-by-childless-31-year-old-white-men-and-how-one-stud\nWe are giving everything we have to make this project a reality. However, sometimes that's not enough. We have a very solid alpha, which was thoroughly enjoyed by hundreds over hundreds of people during PAX East, including TotalBiscuit! Dave Voyles, former Editor-in-Chief of Armless Octopus and coordinator of the XBLIG Indie Uprising, also had kind words regarding the game:\n\"The space shooter genre has been sorely missing in action since the critically acclaimed X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter in the early 90's. After my time with GoD Factory at PAX  East, I think GoD Factory is as close as we've come to that experience since so many years ago.\"\nHowever, we might be unable to bring the game to completion. We've been working for 2 years at Nine Dots now, without salary. Our personal savings and resources are spreading thin, and even though we haven't paid ourselves salaries, we still have business related bills to pay. We have to pay for insurances, rent, licenses and many other things to sustain the business. We are surviving on a $25,000 bank loan, but that won't suffice.\nRealistically, in order to put absolutely everything we'd like to havein GoD Factory: Wingmen, it would take around 300,000 dollars to pay for salaries, software licenses, servers, sound effects, music, marketing (we really need to populate our matches to make this game interesting!), rent, insurances, bank fees, accounting fees, etc. Obviously, the biggest chunk of that money would go to salaries so that we may sustain ourselves while we make the game.\nHowever, we don't need all of that money *right now* to be able to progress. With 70,000 dollars, we'd have enough resources to at least bring the game to a sufficiently polished state to start the alpha funding process. Alpha funding is the principle of selling the incomplete game for less than it will cost once finished and using the feedback of early supporters to better polish the game and iron out the details. It's how Minecraft, Project Zomboid and Path of Exile funded their development, to name a few. It's a great way to leverage a community and funds, which are the two resources we need most to pull off this kind of game.\nWe are also currently under consideration for a loan from the Canada Media Fund to finish the game, but in order for them to back us, they require that we have a minimum of funds ourselves to invest in the project. So if we don't meet our Kickstarter goal, we pretty much have no chance of receiving their help either.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we can add to the game depending on how much we raise:\n$70,000: We can bring the game to a polished enough state to start selling it following the alpha funding model. Features that might not be included when the alpha funding starts include some of the gunship parts, the progression system (all parts would be unlocked from the start), it will probably be still a little bugged and some balance issues, etc.\n$100,000: If we reach that much, then we can guarantee that we'll make a different cockpit model for every species, which will be especially cool for Oculus. Of course, we'll also get closer to a more polished game for any amount above $70,000.\n$150,000: The ability to choose between at least two different carriers, with very different layouts and major gameplay differences.\n$200,000: We'd REALLY like to raise this much since we've been in talk with a famous composer to make music for our game, and we would be incredibly happy to have him do the soundtrack for our game.\n$250,000: More complex levels, including space stations that must be captured to gain benefits for your team, such as power-ups.\n$300,000: We'll have a clan-based ladder ranking system. We'll also be able to guarantee that we'll support the game for at least a year from launch. We'll put extra money into our servers and release the game early in August so people can start interacting with it, even if it's not final! That will also give the players a bigger say on how the game will turn out.\nStraight from the first reward tier, you pre-order the game, for probably less than what it will cost at launch. So many things could happen during development though, so don't take the release date for granted. \n\nMany tiers give you access to exclusive content that will only be available to our backers, such as the Super-Gold material for your ships and some vanity items that alter the look of your ships in unique ways. The best rewards however allow the backers to directly influence the game's look for everyone to see. You get to change the game in a way that everyone will experience. We're also very open to suggestions! So if you'd like to contribute but you don't see the kind of reward you're looking for, just send us your suggestion and we'll see if we can make it happen. No promise here, but it's always worth a shot!\nAll our backers will also be thanked in the game's credits.\nSo here's a more detailed explanation for every reward tier.\n$10 or more\nThis is exactly the same offer as $15, but for less. The thing is, it's a limited offer!\n$15 or more\nPre-order the game. You get the game as soon as it's ready.\n$35 or more\nPre-order 4 license for the game, meaning that you can assemble a full team with your friends. You also get two exclusive cosmetic additions that are only available to backers who paid enough to reach this tier: one is a Wing Lamp that adds some kind of flare effect in front of your ship, while the other is a highly reflective, Unique \"Super-Copper\" material that you can apply to any of your ships.\n$50 or more\nAdd to the package a single access to the Beta, meaning that you get to try the game before everyone else, give us feedback on how to make the game better and start mastering the game before everyone else! You also get the exclusive \"Super-Silver\" material to apply to your ship and a vanity item that will add a blazing fire to your trails. Finally, you get one of four unique ships designed only for our backers. These ships are made from the three major ship parts, which are the wings, the hull and the cockpit. There is one unique ship per species.\n\nUPDATE:\nWe will reveal the look of the exclusive ships as we make them in the FAQ!\n$100 or more\nNot only do you get all the previous rewards, you also get all future expansions and DLC to the game. We intend to support the game for a while and frequently update with new content, and it will all be available to you without spending one dime more. You also get all 4 unique ships, and the unique super-gold material to apply to your ship. You also gain access to a special plug-in that allows you to make your own holographic emblem, in a similar fashion to guild emblems in many MMOs. \n$250 or more\nThere are big billboards on space stations and satellites that will appear in some level environments. These billboards will shuffle through a bank of images. You get to provide us with an image of your choice (we need to approve of the image first) and your image will be displayed on those billboards. You would like to promote your own game? You want to make a joke to make our players laugh? You like kittens? Show it on our billboards!\nYou also get a vanity item that alters your ship by adding big Diamond gems to your ship.\n500$ or more\nYou get to design your own stellar Constellation, which all players will see in the sky surrounding the battlefield. You will have a maximum of 12 stars for your constellation. Note that not every constellation will necessarily appear at the same time in every match.\nYou will also get a Vanity Item that produces an Ornate Luminous Halo on your ship.\n$1000 or more\nFor this amount, you can either design a custom Planet that will be up for everyone to see in the game *or* a custom Vanity Item, similar to the other vanity rewards such as fire trails, diamond chunks, star flares in front of your wings, etc. Tell us what you'd like to see, if it's reasonable we'll do it. We won't do anything offensive or which concerns intellectual properties we do not own the rights to. The planet will not appear in every match and will be one of the randomly shuffled level element.\n$2500 or more\nDesign a GoD Monument (instead of a Planet or a Vanity Item), which are absolutely ASTRONOMICAL statues or monuments. These colossi have a big visual impact on levels, even more so than planets or space stations, and will usually be the main piece in a level environment. Just like the planet, the GoD Monument will not appear in every match. It will be one of the random elements that composes a level's environment. Believe us, all players take notice when a GoD is there. In some cases, we might even be able to animate the GoD monument, depending on the complexity of the concept.\n$5000 or more \nDesign a new Carrier Cannon (instead of a planet, vanity item or GoD) This cannon will have its own unique shape and projectile special FX. You also choose whether this cannon will only appear on your side when you're part of a match, or if every player in the game has access to it.\n$10000 or more \nFor this much, we actually make a game that will be available in our game. In the Crew Quarter menu, where a player can see his stats, trophies and codex entries, there will be an arcade cabinet which can be selected to play a game. This game will be your idea, which must not take more than 2 weeks to make. We'll discuss this at length to make sure it ends up being something you're satisfied with, but you need to have realistic expectations. This arcade cabinet will be available for any player to try.\nWe need your help, and the simple fact that you're here reading this, that you've spent time considering our project or watched the video means a lot to us. If you like what we are doing but can't afford to contribute at the moment, know that you can help us a lot by simply talking about us and sharing our Kickstarter. We're very grateful for this kind of help as well and we know all too well that sometimes you're just strapped for cash and can't help this way.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven if we meet our goal of $70,000, there is always a risk that development would not go as planned. We could start our Alpha funding model for sure, but if we don't receive enough support afterward, we might have to stop development before reaching the fully fleshed out game we want to make. That's a worst case scenario however, especially considering how far in development we already are.\n\nWith this being said, we've been extremely committed so far. Considering that we've been doing this for a year with no salary working on GoD Factory, I think it's pretty safe to think we can bring this project to completion if we get the cash and the support from our backers. We've completed a game project before and we know what it entails. We made mistakes with our first title and we do not intend to repeat them, so we are ready, more than ever, to take on this challenge.\n\nThere is also the risk that the game might turn out to be something different than what you expected. Games are subjective, so the experience will vary from player to player. No matter what, we intend to deliver the best product our resources will allow us to make.\n\nBut really... we have no intention of dropping the ball.

Thank you all so much for your support.  We are incredibly excited to say that for a limited time, we will be taking pre-orders through our website, which will be opening soon.\nWhat is Plume?\nPlume is a streamlined, recoiling mudguard which complements the look of your bike. Plume looks as good when it's protecting your back from muddy street water as it does when it\u2019s coiled away.\nWhat's so special about Plume?\nPlume extends out into a sleek fender or recoils back into a tight circle under your seat with the gentle press of a finger, even if you\u2019re in motion. To top it off, Plume uses resilient, street-tough materials (stainless steel and a flexible polymer) so you can trust it to stand up to some nasty conditions.\nWell that's pretty fantastic.  But what's wrong with normal mudguards?\nFor some reason, there are a lot of unattractive, poorly made, easy to break or steal fenders out there. In fact, some people have taken to fashioning home-made mudguards from plastic bottles or cardboard in protest.\nWhen you\u2019re riding on a wet street, Plume acts as a barrier\nbetween the muddy, chemical-laden water and your clothing. It\nalso looks damn fine while doing so. When the sun comes out, simply reach back with one hand and press down on the Plume to make it recoil into a minimal circle under your seat.\nI'm sold, but if you had to provide two more details about Plume that would make me extra happy, what would they be?\nPlume was designed to be difficult to steal. Its stainless-steel spine wraps around your bicycle's seat post. Plume also attaches to a wide variety of seat post sizes, which makes installation easy, and removes the need for extra clumsy shims or spacers.\n-------------------------------------\nPlume is a project that has been in the works for a long time, since Patrick and Dan met in London four years ago. Both designers ride their bikes everywhere.  \nLondon's reputation for rain is dead on \u2013 it's not an exaggeration.  If anything, it rains more than Hollywood would have us believe.  Naturally, Plume was born out of a desire for a better mudguard.\nAs we worked on it, the demand for a product like this became more and more apparent. Ultimately, we realized that Plume could be big, and that the best way for two idealistic designers to get the word out was Kickstarter.\nWe have produced several prototypes of Plume and have a chain of manufacturers who are feeling just as good about this project as we are.  If we raise $18,000 we will be able to pay for tooling and production costs for the very first production run of Plume.  If things go bananas, we will be able to afford fancier tooling which will cost more initially, but will allow us to produce Plume much more efficiently, potentially getting us geared up for distribution to bike shops around the world!\nWe're super excited by the prospect of getting to share this process with the Kickstarter community. We feel like children on Christmas morning when we get the opportunity to hang out with our manufacturers and play with their machines. So throughout the production process, we\u2019ll be taking all of our supporters on a virtual field trip. Factory visits, insight into our design process (it can be very messy) and frequent updates, all in an effort to honor Kickstarter's gap-bridging manifesto, and to ignite conversation with like-minded people around the world.\nThe rewards!\nWe've got a bunch of exciting rewards for you guys.  We've done our best to keep them as affordable as possible.  For the benefit of everyone, we will ask you to pay for your individual shipping costs based on your address at the time of fulfillment.  Allow us to break it down for you.\nKARMA POINTS:\nWe've been there.  You like an idea and want to show it some love, but maybe can't afford to shell out right now.  Don't worry, if you scratch our back, Karma will scratch yours.\nREFLECTIVE STICKERS:\nIf it were up to us, everything would be reflective.  Let's take one step at a time though. The pack consists of six circular reflective stickers.  This is the same high quality reflective material used on the Plume Mudguards, as well as police cars and ambulances around the world.\nTURBO BOOST:\nTurbo Boost in action\nTurbo boost is a nitroglycerin-powered accelerator which can be easily mounted to the rear of your bicycle.  The Turbo Boost pack includes two canisters of our secret nitro formula, a base plate, and a mounting strap constructed from an elastomeric polymer band.  Illustrated instructions are also included.  (Written irony is tricky.  In case it wasn't obvious, the Turbo Boost is basically two confetti poppers and a laser-cut base plate, and a rubber band.  But it works surprisingly well.)\nPLUME:\n$35 gets you your very own Plume mudguard.  You'll be the talk of the town.  Your Plume will have been made by British factories, it will probably have been raining outside while they were made, and there's a certain irresistible poetry there.  If funding is successful, we should be able to get Plume into your hands for Autumn.\nPARTY TIME:\nWe are going to be throwing a major fiesta if we successfully fund this project.  Actually, we'll be throwing two.  One will be held in London, the other in New York City.  As a backer at this tier, you will not only have helped make our dreams come true, you also get TWO tickets to our celebration.  Of course, you will also get a Plume when they are ready.  We're pulling out all the stops on this because A) we love parties, and B) we love you.  We're talking open bar and carnival games kind-of love.\nMEGA PARTY TIME PACK:\nWoah- this one is mega.  At this level, you get a ticket for you and a friend to our party (again, we're throwing one in London and another in NYC, so it's up to you which you attend).  You also get a Plume as soon as they come off the production line.  But as a backer at the Mega Party Time Pack level, you also get the Turbo Boost, the Reflective Sticker Pack, AND a hand screen printed Tee Shirt!\nYou're going to look really good in our hand printed tee. Then you're going to get it covered in bike grease. But before long, you'll notice everyone else smearing their t-shirts in bike grease too. Soon, high-street shops are selling pre-greased t-shirts for hundreds of dollars. Have you always been such a trend setter?\nGOLDEN PLUME:\nThis one's for people who really like the idea of Plume, have a taste for extravagance, really want to help us, but maybe don't have a need for 30 mudguards.  For $1,000 you get a very special edition GOLD PLATED PLUME!  We can't promise it will work, and riding around in the elements will most likely ruin the gold plating.  But who uses their silver cutlery anyway?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a physical product is always a challenge. Obstacles can crop up from anywhere. Between the highly accurate tooling required, choices in material composition, finding just the right balance of heat, time, and pressure for bonding to occur, shipping between multiple factories, and human error, it is a miracle that anything gets produced on time. To add to this, Plume is made from material combinations and unique components which haven't been executed in many other products before. We have spent a lot of time finding manufacturers willing to take on a job which is somewhat risky when compared to every-day run of the mill type work. Plume may look simple, but there is a lot going on under the hood.\n\nThat said, we are working very closely with manufacturers and material suppliers based in the United Kingdom. This gives us a level of communication and flexibility which we would not have if we were producing Plume overseas. We have already successfully locked down an effective and proven flow of production, and have been investigating processes which could produce the same product even more efficiently.\n\nWe are experienced and well versed in the manufacturing and production of physical products. Having spent years working through the kinks and potential hiccups which Plume could throw our way, we are now at a stage where we are confident that Plume will deliver.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Designs of The Year Award VOTE OUT", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\nToday is a big day for us, it's the online social vote between the Plume Mudguard and the GoPro Camera on the Designs of The Year Award website. \nNow this is not an easy choice for many to make.

However, when you finally do triumph, victory will be sweet.\nCreate new gear in your workshop, everything from sword and shield and bow and arrow to rocket legs and even pets. Use our balanced mod system to make each one functionally unique: give yourself a massive, paralyzing great sword that drains health from enemies or a turret that sets enemies on fire but heals allies.\nWhether it's a photo of your favorite sweatshirt or a drawing of your ideal sword, you can upload whatever you want as the look for your gear. If you're not much of an artist, you also can choose from looks drawn by other players.\nYou can equip any combination of gear, each with its own custom mods and look, to become something truly unique. Once you\u2019ve got all this stuff on, look in the mirror. You\u2019re an Artizen now, my friend.\nWe plan on releasing a trading post feature which will let players trade gear with each other.

It contains your workshop, inventory vault, trophy case, and possibly more features as we expand, like a garden or stable.\nTrading Post - This is where you can buy and sell materials, your art for gear, the gear itself, or even full sets of gear.\nMission HQ - This is where you can team up with other Artizens in town to complete challenges. Many will have you hunting monsters, but others may be defense missions, rescue missions, etc. The missions available to you will be semi-random based on your skill level. With each mission victory, your skill level will increase, but with each failure it will decrease.\nWilderness - This is where missions send you. Each wilderness is unique and new ones will be discovered over time. There are approximately 10 areas within each wilderness location and you can move among them as you choose. Monsters will often move between areas, flee from danger, and try to trick you, so bringing a team to corner them is your best tactic.\nArtizens is greatly inspired by our favorite games, but mainly by ones that start with the letter \u2018M\u2019. Here are some of our greatest inspirations and how they have influenced Artizens. If you love these games, then we love you :)\nMonster Hunter - We love the massive monster fights, skill-based gameplay, teaming up with 3 other friends, and crafting with harvested materials. We aspire to satisfy the Monster Hunter hunger for the 2D realm.\nMega Man - We love the skill that goes into the defeat of a boss and we absolutely love the reward: gaining their ability for yourself. The monsters you\u2019ll fight in Artizens will have unique abilities and by defeating them, you\u2019ll gain the materials needed to make gear that has similar functions.\nMagic: The Gathering - A collectible card game? What does that have in common with Artizens!? Well, actually it has had a huge influence on our customization aspirations and design philosophy. We want every Artizen to be as unique as a 60-card deck in Magic. That means players need a lot of options, there needs to be hidden synergies between different gear and mods, and what emerges needs to be an expression of who you are and how you want to play.\nWe\u2019ve been in development on Artizens for over a year and have finished the core systems that make the game possible, but we're still in the pre-alpha stage for our content.

We want this to be an ongoing game with an ongoing community and ongoing content.\nWe can\u2019t do this without you. Not just without your backing, but without your input. When it comes down to it, we\u2019re only making this game because we think you\u2019ll enjoy playing it. Because of that, your input and feedback are the most important things to us. As a backer, you\u2019ll get access to the development server, which will let you test out new things before they\u2019re ready for prime time.\n $15 - The Gamer - Get the game and access to its early versions.

Since we're an ongoing game, we're going to have a whole lot of music over time and each time we master a new track, it'll be sent to you.\n$40 - The Team Leader - Get the game and soundtrack for you and three friends, enough for a party of adventurers. Because all of our missions support cooperative play and many of our monsters are quite challenging, you\u2019re going to want to play with your friends. It's a great way to show off all the cool gear you make as well. \n$60 - The Immortal - Get all the game expansions as soon as they are available. For life. Plus all the rewards above.

We have a virtual office and we\u2019ll give you access to it, so you can meet up with us online. We\u2019ll work together to come up with a new modification to an existing craft of your choice. For example, maybe we don\u2019t have a mod that makes swords hit twice instead of just once, so you could help us to build the \u2018double-hit\u2019 mod. The only restrictions are that we all think it\u2019d be fun for the whole community to use, it will work on an existing craft, and that it has balanced pros and cons, otherwise it can be anything. You\u2019ll be added to the credits for your contribution. \n$1000 (limit of 5) - The Craftsman - Design a new armor, augment, projectile weapon, or tool with our team. Plus all the rewards above.  This is a much bigger deal than modding a craft. A craft is a whole new object you can use in the game. It will change the way everyone plays the game and you could be one of the devs! You\u2019ll join us online to design a new craft that we all think will be fun for the whole community.

However, we have covered a large part of our initial costs over the last year by finishing the core systems and getting online multiplayer working.\n\nBy succeeding in our kickstarter funding goal, we will be in a position to provide an entertaining initial playable Artizens game (alpha) but we will need additional funding to scale up. We will do everything in our power to raise the additional money needed: investors, another crowdfund, taking on additional work. We won't give up achieving our complete vision of Artizens without a hearty fight.\n\nCONTENT MODERATION\nA game where you can upload your own art is bound to run into some tricky issues. The top two that come to mind are inappropriate content and illegal use of copyrighted material. We plan on upholding all state and federal laws, of course, but we don't plan on going beyond that to specifically enforce quality of content or check to see if players have told us the truth about owning their work. Instead, quality and appropriateness of content will be judged by the community and they will be given tools to enforce both their individual standards and standards for the community. \n\nGAME BALANCE\nGames like ours thrive on balanced gameplay. With so many options of things to make and equip, it can be easy for unbalanced, optimal combinations to emerge. However, this is an ongoing game with deep community involvement, so if it's broken, we'll hear you and get to work on it right away. We'll also be constantly doing our own internal testing and balancing to hopefully catch these issues before they arise. We have experience working on ongoing games, responding to player feedback, and addressing problems very quickly. A fair, balanced, and fun experience for everyone is our priority, and we know it's an ongoing task to always maintain that.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Artizens is coming to a close", "update_content": "I\u2019m very sad to say that we need to begin closing down Artizens.

We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images.

Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

When I turn 40, I'll have a 1-hour video that encapsulates my 30s.  If I live to see 80 years of age, I'll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.\nEach second has a story. \nI gave a TED talk on this project at TED 2012! Photo Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nI spent a couple of years saving enough money to afford taking a frugal year off from work.  I wanted to spend it doing all the important things I never had time for\u2026 travel, family, and my own personal creative projects.\nThis is 1 Second Everyday\u2026 me at age 30 (original):\nThis particular project has had such a profoundly positive impact on my life that I think everyone could benefit immensely from doing it too.  It's easy to do\u2014the process requires very little time or effort, but now I\u2019m trying to make it even easier, so everyone everywhere can experience this exciting project.  In collaboration with the extremely talented developers at Alchemy50 here in Brooklyn, I've spent the past few months developing an App that will make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do too.\nhome screen\nThis project initially started as just a fun way to chronicle my year off, but it quickly turned into something more important.\nRecording one second every day suddenly allowed me to easily reflect back on my life\u2014to look back at my day-to-day decisions.  I started re-evaluating how I approached each day.  Quickly, I was able to see when a couple of days would go by when I hadn't done anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine.\nWe have a tendency to pull cameras out when we're doing something fun or interesting, but we probably don\u2019t think to record when we're just sitting at home watching TV.  Recording a moment daily started encouraging me to wake up and seize each day.  \nQuick interview with CNN regarding 1SE:\nClick for video interview. [2 minutes long]\nI don't know about you, but I've always felt that I have a pretty bad memory.  If you asked me about a particular year\u2014say, 2007\u2014I really couldn't go into detail about it.  Sure I remember where I lived and where I worked.  I could probably find some photos to remember a couple of notable events by, but what about all the days in between?\nWhat did I do then?\nJust because we didn't do anything world-shaking one day, doesn't mean we should forget that day ever happened.  Perhaps use your less-enthralling days to inspire you to do something cool tomorrow.  Instead of letting the days, months, & years blend together into a hazy mush, make each day have meaning!  This project continues to provide me with priceless data on how I'm living my life, and it can do that for you, too.\nReliving the past month in 30 seconds\u2014or a year in 6 minutes\u2014provides a treasured perspective on life.  It holds me accountable for making every day count.\niPhone 5 Ready!\nSome App Features\nThe App accesses the videos in your camera roll, so you can start recording 1 Second Everyday RIGHT NOW!!

The 1SE App will use any videos in your camera roll.  But if you want to record your second directly from the App, you can!\nOptimized for iPhone 5 users.\nOnce you've selected a day's second, you can remove the original video from your camera roll.  The App copies the moment and keeps it within the App itself.\nYour seconds are privately held on your phone.  You never have to share this with anyone if you don't want to.  The primary purpose of this App is to help you remember your own life.  Sharing is optional.\nAbout the Developers\nAlchemy50 is an application design & development studio in Brooklyn.  Their roots are in financial software, but they broke out of their corporate shackles three years ago to pursue more freedom in the types of projects that they can apply their talents to.  They've been fantastic to work with, and have been a closer partner with me on this project than I ever would have imagined. We've had hours of conversations debating the finer points of the project itself as an exercise, and the app design is a great reflection of the soul of the project as a result of that.\nAdditional thoughts\nDigital Cameras have made it easy to capture our lives, so most people are over doing it. And just because we can, doesn't mean we should. The limitations of rolls of film used to force us to prioritize what was worth capturing & what wasn't. I believe we should record less, & live more. Ruthlessly record only what's most important.\nSure people have been doing projects like these with photographs for years, but movement & audio are crucial to remembering a moment.  A photo can't capture my dad's voice\u2026 his laugh\u2026 or the way my mom's expression changes when I surprise her.\nThis project has produced an interesting side-effect: it encourages me to do at least one interesting thing every day.\nSend your compilations directly to social networks.\nI rarely capture the best moment of a day.  A lot of the seconds you see are actually from before or after a moment I want to remember, but seeing the moment I did capture still brings me back.  Trying to record the perfect second puts too much pressure on myself, and becomes a chore.  Wouldn't it be better to fully live an experience, than risk missing it while trying to capture it?\nWriting things down on a journal just doesn't generate the same results as actually having an audible/visual trigger to jolt your memory.\nI personally don't add filters, and I almost entirely shoot in first person perspective because I want to remember things exactly as I saw them with my own eyes.\nI like to think of each second as a \"Save Point,\" as if my past was a really complex video game.  Each \u201csave\u201d allows me to return to where I was and how I felt, and to connect the dots to remember un-captured events that transpired between any 2 recorded seconds.\nMy Story\nFebruary 20th, 1981 \nI am born in Peru. \n1987 \nMy family moves to New Jersey.\n1996-1999 \nI spend my high school years making 3D computer animated short films for fun.  At this time I begin to come into the fullness of my geekdom and movie buff-ness, and develop a passion for story telling, so short animated films become my way of exorcising those creative demons.\n2000-2004 \nI move to Brooklyn and enter Pratt Institute of Art and Design as a Computer Animation major.  My time is spent in being mesmerized by extraordinarily talented artists and I am immersed in non-stop inspiration.  While other animation majors students focus on courses in that field, I can't help but explore classes in a spectrum of artistic disciplines, including film, graphic design, and photography.  By the time I conclude my last class, I\u2019ve realized a most important lesson: all knowledge is connected.\n2004-2006\nI start working in advertising.\n2007\nI discover\u2014and become addicted to\u2014TED Talks.  Like many people who are drawn into the world of TED Talks, it becomes a life goal for me to be worthy of that stage someday.  To have an Idea Worth Spreading.\n2008\nI spend my rare free time working on personal creative projects and teaching classes at schools like Pratt & NYU.  One of these projects is directing a music video composed of 45,000 photographs.  The video ends up on the front page of Digg, Gizmodo, and Wired, and is staff-picked by Vimeo.  This is an exciting, exhausting time for me, but I\u2019m not in a situation that allows me to dedicate myself fully to this kind of work.\n2009\nI'm still in advertising\u2026 constantly working long nights and long weekends. I find myself increasingly dissatisfied creatively.  My social life is nonexistent, and don't get to spend enough time with my family.\nAnother 100+ hour work week.\nOctober 2009\nI watch a TED talk by Stefan Sagmeister\u2014The Power of Time Off.  My life is changed forever.  In his talk, Sagmeister (also a Pratt alumni) explains how his creativity has benefitted from shutting down his studio every seven years and taking a year off from work.  I'm instantly inspired.  I immediately start crunching numbers and looking at my savings.  I figure out how much I will have to save in order to take a frugal year off from work, and start saving saving saving.\nFeb 20th, 2011\nI turn 30 years old! I quit my job!  I start a year off from work so I can do all those things I\u2019ve never had time for, like travel, spend time with my family, and focus time on my own personal creative ideas.\nThe first of these ideas is a project I call \"1 Second Everyday.\"  The concept is simple: every day I record one second of video\u2014something that will help me remember that day.  I then begin chronologically compiling these tiny slices of my life into a single, continuous video.\nMarch 2011\nThe 1 Second Everyday idea begins as a fun way for me to chronicle my year off, but it quickly grows into something more important.  It allows me to easily reflect on my life and to look back at my decisions.  I start re-evaluating how I approached each day.\nAfter only a few weeks of compiling clips, I\u2019m able to look at the video and identify instances when several days go by without anything remotely interesting or outside my typical routine occurring.  It starts encouraging me to wake up & seize the day.\nI decide to continue doing this for the rest of my life.\nMarch 27th & 28th, 2011\nI forget to record a second. It torments me, but I learn a valuable lesson: when you're not doing anything interesting, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment.\nApril 15rd, 2011\nA once in a lifetime opportunity pops up on my Facebook feed.  TED decides to hold the first ever TED talk auditions. I have doubts about anything in my life being worthy of the TED stage, but I\u2019m plagued by the thought that if I don\u2019t apply, I\u2019ll regret it for the rest of my life.\nApril 23rd, 2011\nIt occurs to me that my 1 Second Everyday project might be an \"Idea Worth Spreading.\"\nApril 25th, 2011 \n(thank to the 1SE project, I now know exact dates for these notable moments)\nI post my one-minute audition video to TED with just minutes to spare before the deadline.\nMay 6th, 2011\nA dream comes true, and my life changes forever.  I receive an e-mail from TED that out of hundreds of submissions, I'm one of 17 (including Reggie Watts!) to be chosen to audition live on stage at a special TED event in New York!  \nMay 24th, 2011\nTED talk day. Many fly in from around the world to audition, but I only have to take the subway.  I've never been more nervous.  Worst-case scenario\u2026 I tell myself to just speak from the heart.  I walk off stage convinced that I was horrible.  I unintentionally close off my talk by saying that I'd like to build an App that would make this easy for anyone to do.  Ultimately, I\u2019m happy just to have done my best and pleased that I now have a photo of me with a TED sign behind me. I\u2019m convinced it'll be my last Facebook profile photo ever.\nPhoto Credit: James Duncan Davidson\nJune 6th, 2011\nI fulfill a lifelong dream to drive around the USA to the West Coast, return through Canada\u2026 and do it slowly.  My friend Schoneck and I head off, and will not return to New York until 95 days later.\nJune 15th, 2011\nI get a phone call from TED, asking if I'd like to come speak at TED2012. I freak out!  Somehow, I\u2019m able to keep it a secret for the rest of the year.\nOctober 26th, 2011\nA catastrophic event hits my family.  I don't forget to record a second every day.  It devastates me.  Learn a valuable lesson, when you're going through horrible times, it doesn't occur to you to capture the moment\u2026 but my 1SE project forces me too.  \nDecember 24th, 2011\nAfter 2 months in the hospital, my sister-in-law returns home in time for Christmas.  In the months that follow, I'm grateful that I kept recording 1SE.  Reflecting on the bad times allows me to better appreciate the good times.  Before 1SE, this wasn't easy to do.\nJanuary 11th, 2012\nThe secret is out.  TED announces the speaker program for TED 2012. Now I can tell my friends and don\u2019t have to freak out alone!\nJanuary 25th, 2012\nFinally, after a long absence, I fly back to Peru to spend time with family.\nFebruary 20th, 2012\nI turn 31. It's a wrap for the first year of my lifelong 1SE project.\nFebruary 27th, 2012\nThe TED conference begins & I'm utterly overwhelmed in every conceivable level.  I meet some personal heroes of mine included Bill Nye (the science guy).  I mention to him how nervous I am about speaking at the end of the week.  He replies, \"if you weren't nervous, it wouldn't be worth doing\".\nMarch 2nd, 2012\nOne of the best weeks of my life comes to a close as the TED conference concludes, and I give my TED talk. \nTED 2012: Full Spectrum.

I did it for a full year before I started using my own experience to design an App that would make it extraordinarily easy for anyone to do the same with their own life.\n\nWe've been hard at work on this App for several months\u2014making sure all the technical hurdles were out of the way before we launched this Kickstarter campaign, so that we could guarantee prompt delivery of the App & show it off in action.\n\nAt this point 80 - 85% of the base functionality is in the App. We still need to add that last 15 - 20%, which consist mainly of social integrations and the overlay of text on exported videos. Once that stuff is roughed in, we have to go back and polish everything in the app\u2026 the interactions, animations, layouts (so they match our designs), etc. \n\nFinally we'll put it through as rigorous a testing period as we can, trying to squash any remaining bugs before we submit to the Apple App Store. \n\nThe biggest challenges we've faced have been with the manipulation of video itself - mainly adding/overlaying text to the video. This has taken a lot of engineering discovery time, and thus far has not been solved when exporting videos. We've run into other strange things that have forced us to change course from the initial plans - a good example of this is that we initially thought we'd be able to use the native camera, but apparently it violates the Apple ToS to have an app launch the camera in Landscape mode, so we ended up having to build our own camera module. Although we believe this will work in our favor long term.\n\nA potential risk to our App delivery date (before 2013) could be the App Store approval process. Also, if we can't get the text overlay worked out in time. But we're confident we can.

And Fire And Shields!\nUpdate #12: True Story Bro\nUpdate #11: Items and Equipment\nUpdate #10: Bare Add-ons\nUpdate #8: Kieran on Combat\nUpdate #7: Introducing Our New Writer\nUpdate #6: Combat Explained, Mostly\nUpdate #5: Featured on Forbes\nUpdate #4: Sui Generic?\nUpdate #3: Character Customisation and Advancement\nUpdate #2: Spread the word...\nUpdate #1: Story and the World\nABOUT THE GAME\nOn a treacherous world with a tortured history the meagre remnants of humanity live in awe of a misconceived past, haunted by forgotten gods and fearful of the very ground they tread. A vast sprawling underworld ever present below their feet, baleful demons lying in wait. Thaumaturges, people with powerful psychic abilities, have abandoned their once benevolent nature turning to cruel and dark activities in their quest for ultimate power. Awoken by impending threats, an abandoned and damaged being gives rise to its ancient weapons who now walk amongst the people again.\nSui Generis is set in a dark, hostile mediaeval world pervaded by intrigue and treachery. A completely original work evolved over many years, the Sui Generis universe is the product of many rare moments of inspiration. It encompasses a vast and rich history spanning aeons and galaxies, not as vague mythology but actual chains of events leading to the current situation. In Sui Generis you will get a sense that everything is connected and exists for a reason. You won't just be fed the history in a cutscene or book and you may never know the full story. You will enter a mysterious, unfamiliar world and as you learn its secrets you will discover that nothing is what it seems...\nBelievable fiction. Carefully crafted and researched so it feels authentic down to the smallest detail, the world of Sui Generis will draw you in and captivate you with its depth and complexity.\nNon Linear Story. Write your own story. Create your own character and then interact with the world and events as you see fit. Who knows what might happen? It's not written, it's up to you.\nReactive characters. Characters and creatures do not have fixed roles. They will react to anything you say or do, how you dress and what tone you set. We're putting the word Character in NPC.\nPhysics driven combat. Whether swinging your weapon, shooting an arrow or manipulating the world with your mind, you can expect spectacular and always unique results.\nInteractive environment. Nothing is bolted down or fake, the environment is fully interactive and can play an important tactical role, as well as just provide lots of fun.\nDeep character customisation. Don't just choose a class but create your own unique build and develop your own play style. The paths to success are almost limitless.\nMeaningful Items. Plentiful items, all with plausible qualities and values. Even a rusty sword is effective in the right hands and powerful items will be special and well guarded.\nSui Generis is not about running around killing hordes of enemies in order to collect experience points and numerous items. It is about exploring a world and being involved in major events there. What exactly you do and how you do it is entirely up to you. The world is carefully designed to be believable and have a life of its own. It is not there to wait for you to go on quests, trigger events or make decisions. Events will take their course and may take a turn for the worse if you don't get involved.\nMuch of the time combat situations will be occasional yet meaningful. Few opponents can be dismissed as trivial. Though there are powerful items, even an old rusty sword can be effective in the right hands. There are no levels, but there is a more natural progression system based on skills and thaumaturgic powers. There are no classes, but rather countless possible builds with diverse and interesting qualities.\nAs you advance in Sui Generis you won't see creatures or characters in the world becoming more powerful with you. Rather, you will be able to face opponents and explore locations that previously entailed certain death. Death will not be hard to come by and carries consequences, and there is no saving and loading. The game will put you in situations where trying to get out alive may be your only concern. We believe this is important to keep the game exciting. What's a game if you can't lose?\nThe denizens of the Sui Generis world will never be suicidal walking scratch cards. Every character and creature shares a core AI system that gives them meaningful and diverse behaviours. They never have fixed roles and every action is circumstantial. Your disposition, possible disguises and other factors are crucial in how they behave. Characters carry only what they are wearing and anything else they might possess will be stored somewhere and physically present in the game at any time. Valuable items will tend to be well hidden or well guarded.\nThese are just some of the things we feel strongly about. Hopefully it is enough to give you an idea of what kind of game and world we want to make.\n\nYOUR REWARDS\nWe realise our reward structure is a little befuddling, but hopefully the following breakdown and explanations will make it all much more clear:\n\u00a310 (approximately $16 USD): 1x Digital Copy (release).\n\u00a315 (approximately $24 USD): 1x Digital Copy (release), Digital Soundtrack.\n\u00a320 (approximately $32 USD): 1x Digital Copy (beta and release), Digital Soundtrack, Insider Forum.\n\u00a340 (approximately $64 USD): 1x Digital Copy (alpha and beta and release), 1x Digital Copy (release), Digital Soundtrack, Insider Forum.\n\u00a360 (approximately $96 USD): 1x Digital Copy (alpha and beta and release), 1x Digital Copy (release), Digital Soundtrack, Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\n\u00a380 (approximately $128 USD): 1x Collector's Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 2x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos. \n\u00a3100 (approximately $160 USD): 1x Collector's Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 4x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\n\u00a3150 (approximately $240 USD): Character Design, 1x Collector's Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 4x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\n\u00a3150 (approximately $240 USD): Item Design, 1x Collectors' Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 4x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\n\u00a3250 (approximately $400 USD): Terrain Design, 1x Collector's Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 4x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\n\u00a3300 (approximately $480 USD): VOIP Call, 1x Collector's Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 4x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\n\u00a32000 (approximately $3200 USD): Team Day, 1x Collector's Edition Copy (limited edition boxed copy with goodies, alpha and beta and release), 4x Digital Copies (release), Insider Forum, Exclusive Videos.\nHOW IT WORKS\nEvery copy of the game (you do get one with the \u00a310 tier, just in case there was any doubt!) will come with a key that allows you to register an account with us online.\nAny spare keys you have can easily be given to friends or anyone else as you see fit, which is part of the reason we've included multiple copies in so many of our pledge rewards.\nYour account will give you access to a private area of our website where you can download the full game, as well as all updates directly from us. We will be using a top notch content delivery network to ensure that you get the fastest download speeds possible.\nAccounts can be linked to an installed copy of the game, which will include an auto-updater so you can conveniently download all the latest updates and DLC. We intend to continue development after release and will never charge for DLC, so expect lots of additional free content! Don't worry though, this whole system will be optional and the game will still be playable offline, with no DRM as promised.\nADD-ONS\nWant to customise your reward a bit?\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:\nPress the Manage Your Pledge button on this page. If you have not pledged yet it will say Back this Project.\nIncrease your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add. \nDo not change the tier you are currently pledged at, unless you also want to change it while you are on this screen. If you do change it, you will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the tier you have just chosen. \nAfter the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned. \nNote: All add-ons require the base pledge to be at the \u00a310 tier or above. Any pledge that ends up including a physical reward will require you to add \u00a35 for international shipping, unless it has already been included in the base pledge (i.e. \u00a380+). You will only have to pay this once no matter how many physical items are included.\nDigital Add-Ons: \nDigital Soundtrack +\u00a35 \nExtra Digital Copy of the Game +\u00a310 \nExtra Three Digital Copies of the Game +\u00a320 \nExtra Digital Copy of the Game Including Beta Access +\u00a315 \nExtra Digital Copy of the Game Including Alpha Access +\u00a330\nExclusive Downloadable Videos +\u00a330 \nPhysical Add-Ons: \nAudio CD Soundtrack +\u00a315\nExtra Collector's Edition Copy of the Game +\u00a360 \nSui Generis T-Shirt +\u00a320 \nBare Mettle Hoodie +\u00a340\nMORE INFORMATION\nClothing\nCustomise your attire with one of the following options:\nInsider forum\nIn this forum we will interact closely and openly with you to discuss features and development of the game. We will tell you what we're doing and how we're doing it, discuss ideas before they are final and listen to what you have to say.\nExclusive videos\nYou will be able to download frequent exclusive high quality HD videos showing and explaining new features and content as we develop them. This may include new powers, combat skills, creatures and characters, environments and more.\nCollector's edition\nAlthough a little unclear from our reward description (sorry about that, can't change it now!), this is a limited edition copy for our supporters only and we do want it to be something special. If there is ever a retail boxed version it will be through a publisher and be a standard copy. So... What will be in the box? The game itself will come on a printed USB memory stick, not an optical disk. The soundtrack CD will come in a jewel case. There will of course be a printed manual too. We're only reluctant to include a map because we may want to expand the game world after release, for free of course, but we're happy to take feedback into consideration on that one. We also promise to include an extra surprise in the box!\nTerrain design\nAs we all know, a picture speaks a thousand words!\nOne hour VOIP call \nHave a direct one to one conversation with Madoc Evans, get answers to all your questions, tell us what you think and just talk about any aspect of the game or it's development. \n Day with the team \nSpend a full day with us at our (yet to be) offices in the beautiful Siena province. You can bring a friend or your better half. Get a look behind the scenes, interact with the team and if you like try your hand at creating something to be featured in the game using our full blown toolset. End the day by having dinner with us.\nDelivery times are given as the planned release date of the game, but we will deliver any part of a reward as early as possible. We've allowed ourselves 18 months for development and we're confident that we can deliver a complete product by that date.\nThe reward for not pledging is a day with our friend here.\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nWe are a small team of 5 people who have been working in their spare time whenever possible. We are scattered across different cities and even countries. We started work on the game just over a year ago and it's been a difficult journey but we've reached the point where we are able to make it. To complete the game we need to all work full time and together as a team. We didn't know about Kickstarter until recently. We did know, however, that we would need to raise money in order to complete our game. We have always taken a great interest in crowd funding and believe that gamers will be able to appreciate what we are trying to do. Investors are unlikely to share our aims and their involvement could have a negative impact on our game. We also dislike some of the business practices adopted by the games industry in recent years. We want to stick with a simple approach that we consider honest and let the quality of our product determine it's success. We believe that making games should be a craft, not a business. When we discovered Kickstarter we thought it was a perfect fit for our project. We hope that you agree, that you will share some of our excitement and help us see this adventure through to its conclusion. Give us this opportunity and we will prove our mettle.\nBEYOND OUR TARGET GOAL\nOur target goal here on Kickstarter will allow us to focus our efforts on making the game, to work together and to cover basic expenses. We are however a small team and no matter how dedicated we are, there are limits to what we can accomplish alone. With sufficient additional funds we would be able to recruit people and improve the quality and quantity of content and features.\nWe have not set specific stretch goals. We are not a large studio with specific knowledge of what resources we can allocate to the project. We will do our best to deliver everything we consider important for the game regardless of whether we meet some monetary goal. Our game design supports almost limitless content and we will provide as much we can. Some of the important features that we hope to include are a multiplayer version on at least LAN and support for Mac and Linux platforms. There are also numerous game features and technologies that are not essential but can contribute to making the world more interesting and realistic.\nTHE TEAM\nAs a team we have a unified vision of our game and its design is a collaborative effort. We all play an important role in expressing that vision and populating our world with wonderful things, both conceptually and physically. Our more specialised skills and talents are what allow us to function on any level and meet all of our needs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough as a team we have professionally developed numerous advanced applications including educational games, we are not a successful game studio with a history of commercial products. Nothing is more important to us than seeing this project completed and we believe we are resourceful people with a comprehensive set of combined skills and talents.\n\nOver the last year we have worked hard in a difficult situation to reach the point where we have proven that this game can be made the way we imagined it. We have not only developed all the core technologies and prototyped the game, but have developed a truly vast and impressive set of tools to ease development and the content production process. We have tried our hand at everything that we thought could pose a challenge and achieved what we believe are excellent results.\n\nOur target funding goal will allow everyone on the team to work full time and, very importantly, in close proximity, as well as covering some basic expenses. If we do not exceed this initial goal there is a very real possibility that we will not be able to produce the quantity and variety of content that we would like to see in an initial release of the game. If this situation arises we plan to continue expanding and improving the game even after release. We will do whatever it takes to make this the game it's supposed to be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Exanima 0.6 Released", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Update #36", "update_content": "With the prelude released we've been taking on board a lot of new feedback and criticism. The physics and general complexity of the game are a big part of what make it interesting but can also make things a little difficult. Not everyone embraces change but we've done our best to filter the impatience of some from the genuine concerns of others. Tripping over too often in dark cluttered environments, fighting your own character when opening doors, some difficulty in precisely controlling your character when they are also at the mercy of physics and many others are legitimate issues that we've been striving to improve.\nWith our latest release we've addressed many of these issues, made some important further advancements in our animation system and generally improved and fixed many things. The response has been very positive and we think the game has now overcome its major shortcomings and the difficulties brought by its innovative features.

Why the lack of updates? What's happening with the game's development?\nLet's be honest here, when we came to Kickstarter we didn't know what we were getting into, not so much in terms of development but everything else. We were excited about making the game and naive about many realities. We saw ourselves as indie devs promising to do a lot of cool new things that people would share our enthusiasm for. Our plan was to focus on the game's most unique qualities, release it and then continue work on it indefinitely after release, improving and expanding it. What we soon realised is that most people were not so willing to forgive a few flaws for the sake of the game's virtues. We would be subject to harsh criticism on all fronts and where we showed ability and quality these would only serve to make them expected everywhere.

You're our first testers so this first release is still under NDA until we've dealt with eventual major issues, please keep this in mind!\nSo, we've somehow overcome the huge ordeal of developing all the functionality and technology needed for a fairly complete playable experience. It may even appear very complete and polished but don't forget this is only the first alpha, there are many features and improvements to come for both Exanima and Sui Generis. This is happening very quickly now that we've gotten the really big and difficult stuff done. Some of the features we have not completed yet will obviously have a massive effect on the game, such as character advancement and thaumaturgy but we have been focusing on things that we believe present the biggest technical challenges and making sure we get them right.

It's how we imagined future games when we were teenagers and that idea has stuck with us. You might find it a little concerning as a backer but there's quite a bit of what we wanted to do that we just couldn't be sure would really work. It made a lot of sense to us, we certainly thought we could do it but with no one having attempted it before we just couldn't be sure.

We want to engage people in fresh new ways with accessible, delightful games and experiences. We\u2019re calling them experiments. Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube was the first of these and we\u2019re taking what we\u2019ve learnt from it and applying it to future projects such as our next step - GODUS. \nPopulous was created over 22 years ago, and we believe that to date, nothing has come close to emulating its powerfully godlike experience. It\u2019s this experience we aim to reimagine. GODUS blends the power, growth and scope of Populous with the detailed construction and multiplayer excitement of Dungeon Keeper and the intuitive interface and technical innovation of Black & White. The original Populous hailed from the 8-bit era but GODUS will use the most modern technology the world has to offer. \nAnd you can help us make it!\nAs a god your destiny is to spread your influence throughout the world. But you are only as powerful as your following. Using your ability to sculpt the land, you can create a habitable environment that will allow a population of believers to flourish. In your crafted utopia you can grow as a god in the face of various challenges that affect the population. You can watch hundreds of individual followers live out their lives with dynamic and captivating behavior. If you choose to spread out and conquer more lands however, you will confront other gods with their own civilizations of followers. There is only room for one god, so prepare to guide your worshippers into battle by altering the world around them with your god powers, then watch your followers reign victorious across the world.\nHalf a living sandbox world, and half a strategy game, players can choose to explore the power of the almighty however they wish. Whether it\u2019s granting the power of life and blossoming the world around your believers, or using godly powers to wreak havoc via natural disasters to defeat the armies of other gods, prepare for the Ultimate God Game: Single Player, Multiplayer, Cross-Platform gameplay, sandbox worlds, strategic battles, living populations, and the power to create, change, and destroy the very structure of the world.\nAn essential part of GODUS is single player. We all love to take the time to hone our godly powers before venturing into the exciting multiplayer wars with other gods.\nIt\u2019s a living world, unique and detailed. And it\u2019s a world you influence, whether you\u2019re good or evil.\nGODUS is instantly accessible, easy to learn but immensely deep.\nAs you flourish and build your own cult, you\u2019ll engage in pitched battles with other gods and their cults. It\u2019s a multiplayer power-struggle the way it should be.\nGODUS draws on the cunning battle-psychology of Dungeon Keeper, the living, changing world of Black & White and the instinctive, satisfying gameplay of Populous.\nPlus you get to be a god. In fact, play well and you get to be the ultimate god!\nGODUS will be developed for the Mac, PC and Mobile devices, we hope to be able to add more platforms as our Kickstarter campaign progresses.\nClick here to back us\nWe are a proudly independent company founded in March 2012, and we\u2019re passionate about creating the next generation of innovative digital entertainment. We believe that a great team with great ideas can lead to great success, and, driven by true innovation and creativity, we\u2019re determined to make some truly unique products.\n22cans has been set up with our own personal savings and the talented team we\u2019ve assembled has already built and released the bizarrely popular Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube. But we need funding to continue, and rather than partner with a publisher, we\u2019re keen to explore the exciting new Kickstarter platform. It means we can stay independent and it gives you the opportunity to have a voice in the development of GODUS.\nOur backgrounds include Bullfrog Productions, Lionhead Studios, Electronic Arts, Microsoft and many others. Most of us have been developing computer games for a long time, and we\u2019ve worked on titles such as Populous, Syndicate, Theme Park, Theme Hospital, Magic Carpet, Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Fable, The Movies, Risen, Moshi Monsters, Sniper Elite V2, and Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube of course.\nOne member of our team is Tim Rance, who in 1989 as Technical Director for Electronic Arts worked on the two-player multiplayer feature for the original Populous as it was released for DOS (those of you unfamiliar, it's the version before Windows). We also have people from Rockstar London, Mind Candy and several other places we really can't mention. Paul McLaughlin has worked with Peter on every Bullfrog game since Populous.\nWe\u2019re a talented team, highly experienced at playing and creating games and it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re extremely passionate about them. Plus we love the idea of using Kickstarter to fund GODUS. Why? We\u2019ll tell you\u2026\nWith GODUS we want to make a game in a culture of openness, co-operation and honesty. Creating a game involves imagination and passion, and we\u2019re keen to share the experience. So we want to make GODUS with you watching and, we hope, participating. Funding it via Kickstarter allows us to stay a small independent team with unlimited freedom in our creativity. It\u2019ll just be you, us and our unbridled dedication (no publishers).\nYou see, although GODUS is a new idea, we\u2019re keen to return to the spirit which started it all. In 1989, in a small, cramped office in Guildford, England, a hard-working and enthusiastic duo experimented, collaborated, took risks and came up with Populous, a game which would become a legend and which would launch the god game genre. \nWe\u2019re going to make GODUS in that same spirit. And your support will enable you to be involved at every stage as we share everything we do and learn with you. We\u2019ll produce video diaries, blogs, live streams, developer chats and a great deal more. We aim to end up with a truly delightful game and as you play it, you\u2019ll be able to say that you also played your part in its very creation.\nWe\u2019ll fund an experienced team of 22 people to make GODUS. That\u2019s not a big team \u2013 we\u2019re doing this efficiently. But we\u2019re committed to quality, so we\u2019ll create outstanding gameplay, characters, artwork, animations, sound and music, and the very world itself. With your help we\u2019ll turn our great idea into successful reality.\nWe need \u00a3450,000 to do this. Yes, games typically cost more than that to make, but we\u2019re sticking to a small, highly effective team and we\u2019ll be employing careful management to keep the project on track and get the most out of our funding.\nGodus Avatars for our backers\nGODUS will take seven to nine months to complete, but if we exceed the amount of funding we\u2019re asking for, we\u2019ll use the extra to enhance the game further and support additional platforms which will add a little more time to the development schedule. Should we find ourselves in that happy situation, as a thank you, we\u2019ll collaborate with you to implement the ideas and features you love the most.\nWhat do you get for pledging? The full details are just over there, on the right. As you\u2019d expect, the greater your support, the more you\u2019ll get in return. But everyone who pledges will be able not only to watch as the game takes shape and get cool stuff, they\u2019ll also be able to influence its design. During GODUS\u2019s development there will be many instances where specific decisions need to be taken and choices made. As a valued supporter we see you as part of the Project, so you\u2019ll be able to suggest, comment and vote to determine many elements of the game. As you\u2019ll discover, designing games is intriguing.\nDepending where you are are in the world, you might start thinking about Thanksgiving and even Christmas soon. We\u2019ve got you covered...any gamers you know, people who maybe even played the original Populous or Dungeon Keeper, you can now get them a very special gift.\nHere's a visual indication of the exciting items you will receive in return for your generosity:\nWe would love to hear from you. We have a website, can also be found and liked on Facebook and we also send out little updates of 140 characters or less on Twitter.\nOur Peter Molyneux can also be found on Twitter @pmolyneux.\nOf course we\u2019ll continuously update this page until we've finished and released GODUS, we will also listen to what you have to say and refine our Kickstarter page  accordingly.\nThank you so much for helping us make GODUS. If you are unable to back and pledge (but we really hope you can help us make GODUS a reality with however small an amount) then sharing this page with your friends and family would be wonderful too. \nWith your help we will make GODUS a reality and reinvent the entire god game genre.\nDigital Add-Ons:\nDigital Download Gift Pack.

Any pledge that ends up including a physical reward will require \u00a310 for international shipping, unless it has already been included in the base pledge (e.g \u00a360+). You will only have to pay shipping once.\n22cans tee-shirt +\u00a316 (approximately $26)\nGODUS tee-shirt +\u00a316 (approximately $26)\nPrinted, Exclusive GODUS artwork +\u00a320 (approximately $32)\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:\nPlease click on the 'Manage Your Pledge' button on this page. If you have not pledged yet it will say 'Back this Project'.\nIncrease your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' by the total of the add-ons you want.\nYou do not need to change the tier you are currently pledging for. If you want to do so, you will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you have choosen.\nWe will send all our backers a survey at the end of our Kickstarter campaign that will ask you which add-ons you want.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenge is to reinvent a genre and make a great game in a short space of time. We\u2019ll only release GODUS once it\u2019s the fantastic game we know it can be. And we want to get it into the hands of players in less than a year from now. GODUS is going to be powerful, unique and rather wonderful, and luckily we\u2019re going to be able to draw on our Kickstarter backers to beta test it with us. Yes, if you back it, you can help us finish GODUS and we\u2019ll have taken another huge step towards the big game which will be the culmination of 22cans\u2019 22 experiments.\n\n22cans has a lot of game industry veterans so we know the risks \u2013 GODUS will be using new technology and that has to be tested and perfected. Balancing and bug-testing the game will also take time. And there are many other factors; for example, Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube showed us what happens when everyone wants to engage with your product online at the same time. We learnt a lot from that in a very short space of time.\n\nFinally, trying Kickstarter is itself a risk. Our backers deserve a great game they\u2019ve funded, seen in through its development and helped create.

I wanted to play a city building game with the feel of an RTS game, but with more depth. More resources, more control, more complexity. In a fantasy/medieval setting.\nI wanted to see trebuchets that destroy castle walls, trees, and earth. Fire used as a weapon against wooden structures. A game where I not only get to build an army, but have to feed that army. By farming, fishing, hunting and foraging. Felling trees to build my siege engines, mining stone to fortify my castle's walls, and having my blacksmiths forge each piece of armor and weaponry to defend my townspeople.\nSuch a game didn't exist in the form I wanted to play. So I decided to create it.\nInspiration comes from games like Caesar, Zeus, Age of Empires, Dwarf Fortress and Minecraft.\nA large wheat farm and chicken roost. Harvested wheat can be turned into flour by milling, which can then be made into bread. Chickens can be used to produce eggs, or slaughtered for poultry. Chicken feathers are also needed to craft arrows.\n\nThe graphics are built with procedural cube meshes sometimes called voxels, making the game world cheap & quick to render. And gives Timber and Stone a look that reminds me of the old pixelated computer and console games that I grew up playing.\n\nTimber and Stone is essentially a sandbox game, where the player is allowed to create any style of settlement, village, or kingdom he wishes. You start the game in a procedurally generated terrain with a random group of workers and few random resources. To survive, you'll have to collect food and building materials. The more wealth you amass, the more likely you'll be besieged by marauding goblin hordes, or necromancers controlling undead armies. Alter the land with large quarries or deforestation and you'll risk awakening the spiders and wurms that live deep underground. Or perhaps that's your intent? To collect their scales and silk to make more powerful weapons and armor. It's up to you. Much of the game's goal is to survive. If you can keep your units happy, alive and working, your kingdom will thrive. \nArchers taking down some invading goblins. Higher level archers are more accurate with their bows, making them less likely to waste arrows. Engineers can craft archery targets to help an Archer train.\nFrom the beginning I wanted siege and castle defense to be a large part of the game. Produce food, gather resources, build farms and villages, but remember that it all must be protected. Siege towers, ladders, catapults, trebuchets, ballistas, drawbridges, and moats will all available to the player (and enemies). The benefit of a voxel based world is that all of this will damage the terrain, trebuchets fire will carve holes into the earth, catapults will be loaded with boulders, flaming tree stumps, or dead bodies, fire arrows will scorch farms and burn wooden buildings to the ground, your enemies will mine beneath your fortifications to get into the city.\n\nI wanted to recreate the fun we had while building these things out of Legos as a kid.\nSpiders are no joke.\nTimber and Stone is played with a 3/4 aerial view, with a fully rotatable & zoom-able camera, so you can view your settlement and the game world at nearly any angle. Every bit of terrain/rock/foliage can be destroyed, moved or built upon. Select \"Build\" from the Design Menu, choose a building material, and you'll be given a select box, click and drag, and you'll make a selection for the construction area. If you have the necessary resources and tools, your builders will start working. This makes constructing housing and castle walls quick and intuitive. Designing Mining zones and Farms works the same way. To have your wood choppers gather wood from trees is as simple as right clicking a tree and selecting \"Chop\", or you can go into your Wood Chopper unit's preferences and tell him to simply continuously chop down trees that are nearest to him. Every unit type has a set of preferences independent to the unit, this allows you the control of having your Foragers hunt boar but not chicken, or to show a visual display of the range of an Archer's bow.\nProfessions include:\nBuilder - Constructs walls, towers, housing etc. Nearly everything that is built onto the terrain is put there by a builder.\nMiner - Digs and mines into the ground for stone and metal ore.\nFarmer - Plants and tends to crops in order to provide food.\nWood Chopper - Gathers wood as resource by felling trees.\nBlacksmith - Works with forge and anvil to create weapons and armor.\nForager - Gathers berries and hunts boar, chicken, and deer.\nStone Mason - Works with raw stone to create brick, cobblestone, and plaster.\nCarpenter - Works with wood to create furniture, tools, and building structures.\nInfantry - Combat unit that can wear all types of armor, and use all types of melee weaponry.\nArcher - Ranged Combat unit skilled with bows & arrows.\nEngineer - Creates siege weapons, defensive structures, and other military designs.\nSeveral more professions are planned, including: Leather-workers, Cavalry, Ranchers, Cooks, and Traders.\nYou can change an unit's profession at any time.\nAs a unit works, his level in that profession will increase. Higher levels will allow the unit to work more quickly, or create more difficult crafts. This makes losing a unit with high levels that much more devastating.\nA builder unit waiting on the player to select where to build a brick wall. Click and drag to choose an area for your units to build, mine, farm, or patrol.\nThe game is something I've become very passionate about, and currently takes up most of my free time. I'm very excited about how far it's come in the last couple months. And simply put, I would love to work on the game Full Time, and let people play it as soon as possible.\n\nWhat your funding will be going towards:\nCurrently, the game is in alpha. Every screenshot here has been taken from the game in it's current state. The engine is 85% complete and playable, with over 90 gather-able & craft-able resources, including armor, weapons, tools, and building materials. There is a ton you can do with the game as-is, but there's so much more I want to add before release. More units, enemy types, monsters, weapons, music, & GUI elements. Website & Forums. This funding will make this possible and grant me the tools to implement everything I have planned quickly. This is the type of game I've always wanted to play and sink far too many hours into. \nIt's a project I'm very excited and passionate about. And one that I'll continue to work on and add to years after it's completion. With the current rate of progress, I estimate a beta testable version for PC in the next month. And the first full release by the end of 2012.\nThank you for checking out my project.\nThe current GUI is place-holder, but 100% functional. (including hot-keys)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI feel much of the groundwork is done, and most of the time I need will be spent ironing out bugs, improving the GUI, and looking for sound and especially music that will suit the game.

Looks like a game I'd really enjoy.\" - Notch\nCastle Story is a creative voxel-based strategy game in which you can build castles one brick at a time using an army of little characters called Bricktrons. \nYour goal will be to explore a vast landscape full of mysteries and dangers, and defend your castle against onslaughts of hostile creatures and possibly other players. \nThe world of Castle Story takes place on flying islands, high above an infinite ocean. The islands are made of voxels, cubes made of various elements, which means you can dig, carve and build anything you can imagine in the landscape. Digging underground to gather resources, stacking bricks on top of each other to build a wall or even tunnelling through a mountain is all possible and even necessary to keep your Bricktrons safe.\nCarefully designing your castle not only requires creativity and imagination, but thanks to pathfinding AI and physics simulations, Castle Story has layers of strategy and depth on top of an otherwise free-form sandbox experience.\nCastle Story will be released for Windows & Mac (with possible Linux support once Unity4 is released).\nBuild any structure you can imagine! Using 2x1 blocks, create structures that are not only good-looking, but also functional. Your Bricktrons need to be able to navigate your castle to build it and to keep the monsters out! \nPhysics! Watch a tower crumble to the ground realistically when its foundations can no longer support it. The entire world obeys to the laws of physics which means that you need to build cleverly so your castle can withstand attacks from projectiles and explosives.\nSandbox! Build a huge sprawling fortress, a single impenetrable bunker or a network of underground tunnels. The choice is yours. Castle Story rewards imagination and ingenuity.\nStrategy! Command your Bricktrons as they build your castle brick by brick. Manage the way they work, what resources they gather, and the places they explore. Use your resources to build weapons and armor for your Bricktrons and all kinds of upgrades for your castle.\nCombat! Using shields, swords, bows and lots more, your Bricktrons can defend themselves against the hostile creatures inhabiting the world of Castle Story. Lead your Bricktrons through tough fights, and use your wits to gain an advantage. You can even build catapults to rain destruction on your foes!\nMagic! The world of Castle Story is permeated with all kinds of magic. Discover resources with magical auras and learn to mix them to create effects. Explore strange places and find mysterious artifacts left behind by unknown civilizations.\n\nWe've been working on Castle Story in our free time ever since we graduated from game design studies two years ago. We posted a video demo of our game on Youtube last January and received a flood of good comments and an amazing reception on the Internet. So we decided to quit our jobs and work on the game full-time. \nUntil recently we\u2019ve been working heavily on creating the engine for the game. While most of what is in the trailer and demo video currently exists, it needs to be refined and organized into a cohesive whole. In other words, we have a prototype, but we want to turn this in a complete game. \nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter to be able to fund the next stage of development for Castle Story, so we can build the single player and multiplayer modes. We\u2019ll use the money for:\nSoftware Licenses : As a startup studio, we are missing several tools to help us get the job done. Software is expensive and the costs add up quickly.\nHosting : Our website currently isn't capable of hosting large amounts of traffic. Bandwidth and maintenance for our website and forums as well as a server to handle traffic will be essential.\nMultiplayer : We've never done a multiplayer game of this scope before, so it's going to take a lot of time and effort to learn the ropes and get it right. \nMusic & Audio : We hired two musicians to compose the music for the trailer and the results were pretty amazing. We would like to hire them back again to compose a full fledged soundtrack for the game. We would also hire a professional SFX artist to make the soundscape just as good as the visuals.\nSurviving : Paying rent for food and basically sustain the basic needs of three full time developers for a full year.\nPolish : If we reach our goal, anything past that will be put back directly into making the game more polished.\nThe game has already come pretty far in the last months. Here's what it looked like only 6 months ago, before we quit our jobs:\nKickstarter is great because it allows us to have a direct relationship with you. Instead of having publishers interfere with the game development, you can contribute to the decision process so we can take the game into interesting directions. That's one of the great advantages of \"independent\" game development.\nGetting your name in the game:\nHere is a video attempting to explain what we plan on doing with the names of our backers:\nThe Beta:\nEveryone who contributes to the Kickstarter (enough to qualify for the first reward) gets an early version of the game and has access to any updates that come further down the road. The Beta will become the final game eventually so anybody who backed the Kickstarter with the minimum amount of 15$ gets the final game.\nThe Prototype:\nGet access to an alpha build of the game soon after the Kickstarter is over. The prototype represents what we've shown so far that works. The amount of content and the replay value will be limited, and the build will probably be slightly broken. But we want people to test this version and give us feedback so we can make the Beta better.\nTShirts:\nWe've designed a few t-shirts for you to choose from. Once the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you to see what t-shirt you would like and what size.\nPosters:\nDuring the 30 days that the Kickstarter is going to run. We are going to post several timelapses of the painting process behind our two posters. Afterwards, we are going to print limited-edition high quality prints for the backers who signed up for the posters.\nHere's a preview of the posters. Keep in mind that those are only sketches. The real posters will be painted during the Kickstarter.\nThe Bricktron Plushie:\nThis hand-crafted plushie is made by one of our friend, a professional seamstress and fashion designer. Each plushie will be made one at a time, so every one will be unique. If you want, you can choose a name for it, or we can choose for you, and we'll sew the name on the plushie.\nWe call this one Randy:\nMore coming soon...\nWe're pretty busy working on the prototype. But once we see what kind of response we get, we have a few extra rewards that we would like to offer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #118", "update_userinfo": "Castle Story Merch Store!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #117", "update_userinfo": "The Frosty Resort - Building Challenge RESULTS!", "update_content": "Hello Kickstarter friends!\nThe results for the Building Challenge are in!

Imagine the ability to play against other players online. There would be a global ladder system on which you could trace your ranking. Players could form clans, invent new strategies and use them to compete with each other.\n\nPersistent Game World\n\nThe one step further would be an online game world, a galaxy with hundreds of star systems, each with numerous planets. Each star system would have jump gates, which serve as hubs from which you can reach other star systems. Planet management would be expanded to include more buildings. You could increase the size of your empire and try to conquer whole star systems, positioning large fleets on jump gates to protect your system from other players trying to invade. Another way to ensure the safety of your assets would be to join player alliances. There are many ways you could make Sidius Nova work as a persistent game world and we truly believe that it would be perfect for that.\nBen & Stefan\nStefan Schmitt is a game designer and programmer living in Mountain View, CA.

With google maps the game will utilize the geolocation feature of the iPhone. It will track where the player moves on the map in real life and relate that to the ingame worldmap, allowing the player to unlock hidden areas and new locales. Essentially, wherever you go, your character goes. \n+ Every pixel in monster guru has been meticulously hand drawn for a distinctive visual style. All of the art is unique and original. This means that every location or creature you come across in the game will be completely different than the last!\n+Compatible with iPhone 3 and above.\n+ Completely original story written by the team.\n+ Over 100 creatures to discover and capture.

That's where you come in. If we reach our goal of $4500 we will have the funding to be able to dedicate more time to developing the game by hiring more programmers and buying much needed hardware.

Don't mind if I do!\u201d \u2013 LightSpeed-Gaming.com\nWHAT IS GUNS OF ICARUS ONLINE?\nGuns of Icarus Online is a team-based, first-person multiplayer airship combat game set in a post-apocalyptic, steampunk/dieselpunk-inspired world. Join a few of your friends to serve aboard an airship, or get a captain\u2019s license and your own ship, crew it with your friends or some hired hands, and set sail for adventure as you brave danger-filled skies to deliver precious cargo and fight off air pirates and rival factions.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is contained in the three classes of Gunner, Engineer, and Captain. Each has a specific and vital role to fulfill, be it manning the guns, making repairs, or piloting the ship, and each player must respond on the fly to rapidly changing conditions. Gunners may abandon their guns to repair a vital component, or the Captain may ditch the wheel to add a little more firepower to a broadside sweep. \nOn the small scale, the game is about the thrill of flying and moment-to-moment airship combat, with its strategy, skill, and frantic action, and the teamwork of a well-knit crew where everyone has a job to do. These experiences are the core of the PvP combat mode in the initial release.\nLater we will expand the game to include a multiplayer campaign mode that\u2019s all about the politics of alliance and conquest, and the economics of nurturing the growth of struggling towns while increasing your own profits through trade. As the captain of a merchant ship, you will be the one that towns depend on to deliver the supplies they need to survive. Lose the cargo en route, and shortages will hamper growth and affect the local economy. As a warship captain, you\u2019ll be on the front line defending or expanding your faction\u2019s territory, protecting merchant fleets so shipments get where they\u2019re going -- or raiding them and bringing the spoils home.\n\nGuns of Icarus Online is the spiritual successor to our previous game Guns of Icarus, which followed the journey of the pioneering solo captain Gabriel aboard his airship the Icarus through pirate-filled skies. Guns of Icarus Online is the expansion of that idea into a broader, richer, more exciting world, and represents the game we always wanted to make. We hope you\u2019ll help us make it a reality!\n\nFEATURES\nCompetitive multiplayer \u2013 Co-op & PvP\nUnique combat system \u2013 Shooter, time-management, navigation\nPost-apocalyptic steampunk/dieselpunk look\nExtensive customization with lots of weapons, engines, and decorative ship parts\nRobust skills system and player classes\nEnvironmental effects playing a key role in ship status and combat strategy\nCampaign with mission, factions, trade, and crafting - dynamically affecting battlefronts and alliances\nTRAILER VIDEOS\nTHE WORLD OF GUNS OF ICARUS ONLINE\nThree hundred years have passed since the Great War consumed the planet. Three hundred years since the human race ate hungrily of mother earth, squandering resources that could have carried them forward for millennia.\nIn the heat of the sun, there is an unsettling, inescapable truth: man has fallen from his throne.\nHumanity now lives among the ruins left by a century of conflict, but from the wrecked steel of the past they will forge their own future. Lighter-than-air technology has inspired intrepid pioneers to take to the skies in search of trade and resources to support their towns and families. Enterprising craftsmen fashion elaborate machines out of scavenged scraps. The desperate and ruthless take what they can by force.\n\nDespite all that was lost, a renewed passion for invention has emerged, along with a deep respect for the fragility of life. Explorers and philosophers travel in search of forgotten knowledge now scattered beneath the wastes.\n\nThe survivors are inventors, pilots, captains, craftsmen, adventurers, fighters, privateers, merchants, engineers, farmers and scholars. They herald a new age for humanity: an age of rebirth.\nHOW WE GOT HERE\nWe are a small indie studio in New York, and we released the first Guns of Icarus in May of 2010 on Steam and later on the Mac App Store.  Before that, we had developed a few small web and iPhone games, but Guns was our first important release where we actually made money on a game! Because our budget was really tight (as it always is, what else is new...), we tried to innovate on the game mechanics but kept the scope small, with a total development time of about five months. The game generated a lot of enthusiasm and did really well, and we received a lot of feedback from players and fans about features they wanted to see and where we could take the game in the future. There were a ton of ideas we still wanted to explore, and the concept and setting seemed ripe for development as a larger-scale, multiplayer game. With Guns of Icarus Online, we are finally able do some of the things we\u2019ve wanted to do since the original game and bring that expanded world to life.\n\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWe were fortunate to have done well enough with our previous projects Guns of Icarus and CreaVures to have the opportunity to make Guns of Icarus Online. This game is our biggest and most ambitious project by far, and we are pouring pretty much everything we have into it.  \nThe funds we raise in this campaign will help us finish and polish the game and go toward things like music and sound design, creating additional art assets, and server hosting and maintenance costs.We want the end product to be as awesome as it can possibly be, which is why we\u2019re asking for your support.\nWe also want to get the word out and reward our early supporters with goodies like discounted preorders, closed beta access, and special limited-edition items. We had great support from people on Kickstarter for our last game CreaVures, and hope people will continue to support us so we can make Guns of Icarus Online a reality!  Help us spread the word!  \nIf you are interested in just lending moral support or helping out in other ways, that's still awesome.  We can definitely use help testing the game and giving us feedback along the way.  We're still working on getting a forum up on the website, so stay tuned for that.\nREWARDS!\nGuns Pilotwing Logo t-shirt! This is a unisex 100% cotton t-shirt from American Apparel adorned with the sweet steampunk \u201cPilotwing\u201d logo by artist Tim Doolen.\n\nGuns of Icarus Poster and Signed Poster! This is a high-quality print of our iconic and beautiful \u201cEvening Airship\u201d wallpaper. Signed posters will be limited to a run of 13 and will be signed by members of the Muse Games team.\nExclusive Costume.  This is one of our favorite costume designs.  The in game costume will have a male as well as a female version.  \nCaptain's Log Book. It is 4x6 in size, which is great for carrying it around, and it features leather covers and a classical, clean look.  We will also have a special Guns of Icarus Online logo stamped on the inside cover, along with a signed sketch by our artists on the first page of each book.  \nCustom USB design.  Please note that this image is a mockup only! The actual USB will have the Guns of Icarus Online logo etched, so it will look even better than this.  \nArt Book.

The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this? We're getting a lot of attention already and it seems like this little project could have an impact beyond itself. \nAll money raised will go to make the game and documentary better. Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.
