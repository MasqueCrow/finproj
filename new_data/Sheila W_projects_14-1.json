The file quality, the lighting and attention to detail is second to none. You can feel his deep passion for NASA and Space come through in every shot - a true labour of love.\u201d\nANDREW DIPROSE - CREATIVE DIRECTOR WIRED (UK)\n\n\u201cThe culmination of nine years documenting the many aspects of the US space programme, Benedict Redgrove\u2019s NASA project is shot in his distinctive style, with an almost scientific rigour that befits the subject matter.

From the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nFor Redgrove, it\u2019s about showing the emotional impact of these objects. \u201cI wanted to explore the reaction we have to these machines and objects when we see them in fine detail,\u201d he says, \u201cand what they mean to us as human beings.\u201d \n\u201cThe image of the astronaut, or spaceman has been with me ever since I was child, as a sort of talisman to all that is great and good. They symbolise the explorer, the hero, the good character, the leader. The spacesuit takes on that character. The suit and the human become one entity, more powerful than either on their own. It\u2019s now a symbol in its own right, and it has become greater than the sum of its parts. It has reached an iconic stature that few objects can match. These objects have come to signify the pinnacle of human achievements.\u201d \nExtravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) Suit - NASA Johnson from the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nRedgrove spent five years negotiating and trust-building with NASA followed by four years of photography and production while holding down his day job. \nIt paid off, and he gained access to some of NASA\u2019s most restricted areas and facilities allowing him to photograph objects rarely seem by the outside world. He went inside the Lunar Samples Lab to photograph the priceless moon rock collected on the Apollo missions, watched the sun set behind the International Space Station from the mission control room and entered the assembly rooms where the next generation of spacecraft are being built. \nSpread showing the Destiny Module of the ISS, from the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nSpread showing Space Shuttle Atlantis from the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nSpread showing the Vehicle Assembly Building from the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nBut it was his encounter with Atlantis, the last shuttle to fly, that left him feeling the full power of these objects. \u201cI watched the launch of the first shuttle mission in 1981, when I was 11, and that started my obsession with space and NASA. Seeing Atlantis was like meeting your childhood hero, but better. I felt like I was having a religious experience.\u201d \nSpace Shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Visitor Centre from the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nThe result is a collection of intimate, finely-detailed images that allow that objects to tell their own story. Shot using digital backs on technical cameras, some images are made up from over 60 exposures to capture incredible detail. The images are then painstakingly retouched to remove them from their backgrounds, allowing them to be viewed without distraction. \nNeil Armstrongs rubber stamp, used to identify his suit. From the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nHISTORY\nI know your first memories are subjective, but as far as I can recollect, my earliest memory is being in a pram, in a dark room with the curtains pulled closed and seeing a grainy black and white picture of man walking on the moon. I was born in May 1969, so I share my years with the Apollo Lunar landings. Maybe this is why I have been so interested in all things space and space travel all of my life. \nFrom watching the shuttle missions and thinking how fantastic that must be to launch into the huge skies above, to hearing about skylab and imagining all that they were doing up there, and being worried when things went wrong. \nSpace was the great adventure, it was the escape and it was the reality, it was all the sci-fi films I watched, but for real. They were magical, exciting and wondrous times for me. It was history before my eyes and I wanted to hold onto those moments. The craft they were in, the suits they wore meant so much to me. They were more than objects, they represented the future, all that was good and exciting with the world. \nSpace Shuttle training facility. From the forthcoming book \"NASA - Past and present dreams of the future\" by \u00a9 Benedict Redgrove\nI have spent the last nine years organising and producing and five years shooting the objects and sites that represent not only my childhood, but all that is good with humanity. Exploration, the thirst for knowledge and the betterment of man kind through those qualities.  \nMy dreams of going into space are now relegated to acceptance of staying on this beautiful planet of ours, but the objects still hold a magical and transformative power for me. It is this energy that I wish to convey. The excitement and wonder of all of these objects is something I hope to transfer. \nI have been to various NASA sites and shot tests and specimens and displayed objects through the help of so many NASA officials from mission controllers, technicians and engineers, project leaders, space suits labs, the space station controller, the Orion facility, the Boeing Starliner facility, the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the incredible educational facilities that the amazing people at Space Centre Houston are creating, the launch pads, the assembly building, the neutral buoyancy labs, the robotics lab, the historical records, human space travel, Aerojet Rocketdyne systems, the hallowed vaults of the lunar vault. Inside the ISS mock up trainer, the cockpit of the shuttle trainer, held original training gloves of Gene Cernan, Dave Scott, Al Bean, the stamps that marked all of Neil Armstrong, Jim Lovell and Gener Cernan's items, the cameras that the Apollo astronauts trained with on earth, stood in the \"jet pack\" MMU 1 that Bruce McCandless helped develop before he took number 2 into space and floated unattached to anyone or anything, the farthest person from earth at the time, looking like the loneliest a man could be, and probably the most exciting a fun and exhilarated too.  \nThis has been a huge part of my life for nine years and now I am able to share it fully with you.\nThe images have been retouched. \nThe book has been designed and laid out. \nThe costs have been worked out.\nNow it's your chance to be part of this enormous project and help bring it to life.

Involving another party that might want to do things their way didnt feel correct, but Kickstarter really does offer that chance. \nIt connects me with you, the people who are not just buying a book,  but more importantly backing and supporting the project. Its a much closer connection than any publisher could offer and I am honoured to have your support and personal involvement, it really means much more to me this way. Your support and connection with the book gives this project more life and spreads it throughout the community through your enthusiasm and shared love of what we are doing together.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES\n\nTHE BOOK DETAILS\nThe book is 295mm (11.6inches) x 375mm (14.7inches), over 350 pages with over 200 images and weighs around 5kg (10lbs).

My name is Emma (or as most of you know me as, Bilby) and I am an Illustrator from Scotland. I have been working professionally as an Artist for about 8 years now, and have recently began my career Illustrating Childrens Books and Running an Etsy store.  With the help of the wonderfully talented EvyBenita, I have managed to put together my first Kickstarter campaign in collaboration with her.  \u2665\nTogether we designed Six beautiful enamel pins featuring British Wildlife decorated with Bohemian inspired patterning. I've always loved the boho style, and thought Bohemian Burrows was a rather cute name for a collection of Illustrations- The only problem was deciding what form I wanted to print the artwork in!. I recently had the idea of making this collection into Enamel Pins after seeing the beautiful colours they come in! (Rose Gold, Ahh! So pretty! \u2665) \nAs some of you may be able to guess, Enamel Pins are pretty expensive to have made, you need to order them in large quantities to be able to offer them at a good price, and adding things like glitter or Additional Colours also bumps up the price. I believe Kickstarter is the best way to fund these pins because of the success I have seen with other Enamel Pin projects. If I don't reach my goal nobody is out of pocket and Kickstarter makes the process easy and simple to figure out. We've surpassed the \u00a32000 goal for the full set, and new designs have now been added! \u2665\n                                           The Pin Designs\nAll the Bohemian Burrows pins will have the following details in common:\nHard enamel\nTwo rubber backs\nSize: approx 2\"/50mm\n#1: Mouse - UNLOCKED!\nRose gold plated mouse: unlocked!\nFollowing the mouse, we've got some exciting stretch goal designs:\n #2: Rabbit - UNLOCKED!\nGold plated rabbit: unlocked!\n#3: Red Fox - UNLOCKED!\nGold plated red fox: unlocked!\n#4: Hedgehog - UNLOCKED!\nRose gold plated hedgehog: unlocked!\n #5: River Otter - UNLOCKED!\nRose gold plated river otter: unlocked!\n #6: Badger - UNLOCKED!\nGold plated badger: unlocked!\n  #7: Red Squirrel - UNLOCKED! \nGold plated red squirrel: unlocked!\n  #8: Doe - Unlocked! \nRose gold plated doe: unlocked!\n#9: Pine Marten - UNLOCKED!\nGold plated pine marten: unlocked!\n #10: Scottish Wildcat - UNLOCKED!\nGold plated Scottish wildcat: unlocked!\n Vinyl stickers: UNLOCKED!\nAll designs are now available as 10cm vinyl stickers! Here's how you can add them to your pledge:\nAdd \u00a32 per sticker\nOr add \u00a310 for the full set of 10\n                 The Kickstarter Exclusive Sticker!\nEvery Backer will receive a LARGE Thank You Sticker!

If the pin you want is not unlocked you will not be able to select that pin design, but you can cancel your pledge if your desired pin is not funded. \n\nThis is my very first Kickstarter campaign and first full set of enamel pin designs I have created, but with the help of the wonderful Evy I'm sure she will keep me on track and make sure the process goes smoothly.

I'm Sam, sole artist and owner of Little Lunar Rabbit Designs.\nUltimately, the goal of this campaign is to get some pins made. To help make the project more manageable, the initial goal was a relatively low one - being only one pin. Rather than running the campaign for all 10 designs and risk not being able to fund everything, I had hoped that by breaking the project into smaller chunks, we would be able to produce as many as we could!\nWe're now a ways into the campaign, and the original campaign is beyond successfully funded! Since we do still have some time left, I have added 4 all new bonus designs, re-released the original Crystal Bunny pin, and added on some really fun milestone stretch goals! \nThe pin that started it all - my crystal bunny design! Having made this one, having gone through the whole process of making my own vector art, translating the emblem into a pin, and finally getting the finished piece in hand is what sparked my desire to finish the rest of the series. It was such a wonderful experience working with the manufacturer for this design, that I am very much looking forward to working with them on the future designs!\nDue to the insanely unexpected success of this campaign, this pin is now available as an add-on for $11 each, and will be available as a selection for your pledge! \n  For those of you who are familiar to Kickstarter, this is simply a little refresher. And for those of you who are checking it out for the first time, here's a breakdown for how things go!\n- Pledge your reward: Choose which reward tier you'd like to \"pledge,\" this is your own placeholder in the project funding, payment isn't due yet, so hang tight! Pledging is zero risk - you pay when the campaign ends and are free to edit your pledge at any time while the campaign is running!\n- Campaign runs for 30 days, goals are met, and pins are unlocked! \n- Campaign ends, you select which pins you'd like from the unlocked designs through a project end backer survey. This is where your pledge payment is processed. \n- Kickstarter releases funds after 2 weeks, and pins are sent into production!\n- Pins are mailed to me, sorted, and then mailed out to you!\n Finally on to the fun stuff - the best part, and why you're all here - the pins!!\nAfter the campaign is over, the intent is to sell the pins at $12 each. \nAs a thank you for participating in the campaign and helping me reach my goal, I've set two special price brackets for this project. The \"Early Bird\" pricing is a limited pricing option, available on a first come, first serve basis. The pins in those select brackets will be $10 each, and come with a free holographic vinyl sticker.\nAfter that, the Kickstarter exclusive pricing will be $11 each.\n- If you would like to pledge for more than 10 pins, all you have to do is add $11 per pin to your pledge! -\nThe holographic sticker will also be available as a pledge add-on, which will be discussed more in the \"Extras\" section - on to the pins!\nInitial Goal: Tuxedo ($300)\n 1.5\" Wide\nHard Enamel with Gold Plating\nRecessed metal accents\n5 Colors\nDouble posted with rubber clutch (won't spin when worn!)\nBack stamped with raised metal logo\nIndividually packaged with backing card in a clear cellophane bag\n All of the stretch goal pins will be:\n 1.25\" Tall\nHard Enamel with Gold Plating\n5 Colors (with the exception of Neptune and Mini Moon, who have 4 colors)\nDouble posted with rubber clutch (won't spin when worn!)\nBack stamped with raised metal logo\nIndividually packaged with backing card in a clear cellophane bag\nPluto, Uranus, Neptune and Mini Moon's designs feature recessed gold accents as well.\nStretch Goal #1: Mercury - UNLOCKED!\n\nStretch Goal #2: Mars - UNLOCKED!\n\nStretch Goal #3: Jupiter - UNLOCKED!\n\nStretch Goal #4: Venus - UNLOCKED!\n\nStretch Goal #5: Pluto - UNLOCKED!\n Recessed gold accents on Garnet Orb\nStretch Goal #6: Uranus - UNLOCKED!\n Recessed gold accents on Space Sword \nStretch Goal #7: Neptune - UNLOCKED!\n Recessed gold accents on Aqua Mirror\nStretch Goal #8: Saturn - UNLOCKED\nStretch Goal #8: Mini Moon - UNLOCKED!\n Recessed gold Time Key, and Crystal Carillon accents\n- BONUS DESIGNS! -\nWith the campaign having been so successfully funded in such a short amount of time, I've decided to add some additional bonus designs! These designs were not originally a part of the campaign, but after much request, will now be as well! Due to the fact that they were not a part of the initial campaign, designs may be subject to slight modifications after approval from the manufacturer. Any updates to these designs will be announced as needed.\n 1.25\" Tall\nHard Enamel with Gold Plating\n5 Colors\nDouble posted with rubber clutch (won't spin when worn!)\nBack stamped with raised metal logo\nIndividually packaged with backing card in a clear cellophane bag\n 1.25\" Tall\nHard Enamel with Gold Plating\n5 Colors\nDouble posted with rubber clutch (won't spin when worn!)\nBack stamped with raised metal logo\nIndividually packaged with backing card in a clear cellophane bag\n 1.25\" Tall\nHard Enamel with Gold Plating\n3 Colors\nDouble posted with rubber clutch (won't spin when worn!)\nBack stamped with raised metal logo\nIndividually packaged with backing card in a clear cellophane bag\n 1.25\" Wide - Her design will appear shorter than the rest, but she will still be a 1.25\" pin! This was a design choice to have her appear slightly smaller than Luna and Artemis' designs.\nHard Enamel with Gold Plating\n5 Colors\nRecessed gold accents on bell\nDouble posted with rubber clutch (won't spin when worn!)\nBack stamped with raised metal logo\nIndividually packaged with backing card in a clear cellophane bag.\n Exclusive to this project, I'm making an extra special holographic sticker! They will be weather safe, and UV coated, so you may blind your enemies with shiny moon-powered love, either inside or outside!\nWhile Early Bird participants will be getting this sticker for free, you can also pledge for it by itself, or add it into your pin pledge! The holographic stickers will be $4 each. \nYou may add as many stickers as you'd like to your pledge, just by adding 4 times the amount of stickers you'd like. For example: If you'd like one pin, but two stickers, you would add $8 to your $11 pledge. It's that easy! You will be able to specify that quantity to me when you get your backer survey.\nOnce this project is over, this sticker will be gone forever! \nAdditional Pins - If you would like more pins than currently offered as a reward tier, you may absolutely add on any additional pins from the entire collection (including the Crystal Bunny pin!) for $11 each! When I send out the backer survey, you will be able to specify how many of which pins you'd like.\nThe campaign has officially hit 10k!! I am absolutely astounded by your support for this project, and as we continue to hit new milestones, I'll be announcing new free gifts! \n10K Thank You - Metallic Chrome Sticker - Free with Any Pledge!\n ((Sample image courtesy of StickerApp, sample designs by @AskSweetCream on Twitter)) \nFor every pin pledged, all backers will now receive a FREE 2\" tall metallic chrome sticker to match! So if you've pledged for let's say one Mercury pin, you will receive one free matching Mercury sticker! If you've pledged for the Full Collection - Bonus Edition . . . that's right! you'll receive a free sticker for all 15 pin designs! \nIf you would like additional chrome stickers, you are more than welcome to add them to your pledge for $2 each! I will have a fully comprehensive backer survey at the end of the campaign to designate how many of which kinds of additional stickers you'd like, as well as your pin selection. \n100 Facebook and 100 Instagram Share Gift!\nAs a thank you for sharing the project for me, I'll be including a free galaxy aesthetic lanyard with every backer's pledge (please note this does not include the \"Lunar Love\" tier - only for those who are getting items shipped to them!)!  \nThey'll be 2 cm wide, galaxy print, with a matching aesthetic to the campaign imagery. You'll be able to put your pins on it without it clashing, or you'll be able to just have a space themed lanyard for whatever use you'd like! I know I'm gonna use mine for holding my con badges! They'll also feature my Little Lunar Bun on them, though the placement may change to the back of the neck.   \nFor those of you who do share the project, be sure to tag me (@LittleLunarRabbitDesigns on both Instagram and Facebook - if your Instgram account is set to private, be sure to take a screenshot and send it to me, otherwise I might not see it!) and be entered to win a FREE Sailor Guardian Spirit Jersey! \n\n15K Thank You Gift - Rainbow Plated \"The Moonlight is a Messenger of Love\" Enamel Keychain!\n That's right! \"The Moonlight is a Messenger of Love\" design is officially unlocked as a 2 inch soft enamel, rainbow plated key chain with a matching heart shaped clasp! This bonus item is free to anyone who pledges for 3 or more pins!\n - Timeline - \nSo. Everything looks good, you've made your pledge, and now you're just . . . waiting. Here's the projected timeline for how everything will go: \n April 5 : Kickstarter campaign launches. \n May 5: Kickstarter campaign ends, and backer reward surveys are sent.\n Mid May: Funds are released, pins are sent into production\n End of June-Mid July: Pins are mailed to me and sorted. \n Mid July-End of July: Pins are packaged for mailing!\n Early August: Estimated delivery of pins to backers!\nAdded into this timeline is a production buffer, should the manufacturer need additional time to complete the pins. Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate, and while I will absolutely do my best to stick to it, these are still human made items that may require a little patience. Any delays will be very transparently addressed in a timely manner. My full time job is also that of a stay at home mom, so packaging pins may also take me some time.\nAnd that's just about it guys! Thank you so much for stopping by, for your pledges so far, and for all the support you continue to give! If you'd like to help out in a non-financial way, I've created two images (square format and \"stories\" format) that you could use to share the project outside of Kickstarter! It would mean the WORLD to me if we could get to that 15K stretch goal! And if you'd like to tag me in any posts, I'm @LittleLunarRabbitDesigns on Instagram, and @LilLunarRabbit on Twitter! Thanks again! \nSquare:\nStories:\n As I mentioned before, I'm Sam. An avid Sailor Moon fan (collector, fan artist and even cosplayer!), with a fantastical love of all things space themed. As a girl, I used to sit after school and get insanely hyped for Sailor Moon to come on, and then later that very night hang out on our back deck with my dad, looking up at the stars with our Polaris telescope. \nWhile my life didn't take me down the path of astronomy, I have always held the stars close to my heart, and try to incorporate them into as much of my life and art as possible. Crossing that with my love for Sailor Moon was an absolute no-brainer. \nMy professional art journey actually started with Sailor Moon, as my first real series work ever completed. To date, I've drawn all ten scouts, Tuxedo Mask and Luna's human form, with more characters planned for the future. With each drawing, I created an emblem to pair with each portrait, which sparked one of my most successful lines to date. The pins here are variants of those very emblems, with a new twist, specific to these pin designs. \nTo see more of my work, you're more than welcome to follow me on all of my social media platforms!\nFacebook || Instagram || Tumblr || Twitter || Etsy\nBefore I wrap this up, I wanted to take a couple moments to thank those who have helped me so much throughout this project, from advice on how to start this project, to the pin production itself, all the way to annoying little design questions. I wouldn't have felt the confidence I do in running this campaign without their help.\nVivian Tong || Sketchbeetle Art - Sheila Wong || Sheila Wong Design & Illustration - Salt Squad Queen || SharkCafeArt - Mellanie Chafe || LuniaraMC\nAnd lastly, my own personal cheer-leading squad - Daci, Toni, Kat, Kieran, and my husband. \nA little late, but a super important one that I missed - Santana. Without her final push, honestly, I wouldn't have thought this was possible. \n The benefit about Kickstarter is that while the campaign is running, everything is risk free. You can change your mind not only about how much you pledge, but also if you want to pledge at all. While I genuinely hope you'll be here for the whole journey, I do understand if you need to back out! \nA couple of things to remember:\n Color translation varies from monitor to monitor - the final pins may be a slightly different than what is shown. I have provided my manufacturer with specific Pantone codes, and aim to have them as close to those tones as possible.\n Line weights may vary slightly from what is shown- at the end of the production process, the pins are polished in a way that very lightly flattens the metal, making the lines appear thicker than pre-polishing. While I tried to make my designs with that in mind, there may still be some variance on the final pins.\n All orders will be sent with tracking (including international!) - once the pins leave my hands and are on their way to you, they are unfortunately at the mercy of the postal service. Package exteriors may receive some damage, but I always do my best to ensure the contents remain undamaged. In the very unfortunate event that a package is lost, please reach out to your local post office for additional information and be sure to file a claim with them before reaching out to me - once that's all sorted let me know and I will try to be as accommodating as I can be!\nInternational backers are responsible for all VAT/Customs fees involved in receiving your order", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is my first Kickstarter campaign, and only my second time taking on pins, I am very confident in my abilities to be able to fulfill whatever level of rewards we end up unlocking! I do currently run a successful Etsy shop, and customer service is very important to me. Any issues that come up will be transparently addressed, and I will do my best to resolve them in whatever capacity I can. \n\nI have also been working very closely with other artists who have run very successful enamel pin campaigns for advice and feedback. \n\nFeel free to message me with any questions!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "\u2764 Lunar Love \u2764", "descp": "You officially are one of my Lunar Loves!

Welcome to Hobby Pets, a hard enamel pin Kickstarter project! I'm Linda, known by my online handle & brand name lemoncreamsicle, and I am a part-time illustrator & designer! I've been creating colorful merchandise (like enamel pins) since 2016, and have been creating art for much longer than that. I'm pretty active on my instagram, and will be posting smaller project updates there!\nThe Hobby Pets project combines my two loves - the celebration of fun hobbies with cute pets! This campaign will put that love into creating a host of colorful, cute, and relatable pin designs. If all stretch goals are unlocked, this Kickstarter will produce 8 unique designs, with 2 colorways for each design. Let's meet the contenders!\nPin specs & backer rewards\nGuest Artist Stickers\nCrowlines ( Instagram | Twitter )\nFor our final stretch goals, I've invited a guest artist - please meet Crowlines! They're a great artist with a distinctive and cute style, and I'm super glad to have them onboard.\n\nEach pledge will include (1) 3 inch sticker design of your choice of the stickers below!\nAdditionally, these sticker designs will be added to the sticker selection pool, so if you've selected a stickers-only tier or have added-on stickers, you can purchase more than one design & multiple copies!\nYou can add-on to your pledge for extra stickers / pins! If you previously pledged to an early bird tier and would like extra pins or would like more stickers, please add to the amount that you've already pledged: \n$2 per extra sticker \n$11 for an extra single pin \n$10 * number of pins you'd like to add for multiple pins (e.g. adding 2 pins, add $20 to pledge)\nFor example, if you've already pledged to \"Choose 4 pins,\" and you'd like to have your choice of 3 extra stickers, you would add $6 to your pledge without changing your rewards tier for a grand total of $46 + shipping. Now, you will get your choice of 4 pins, 3 stickers, and 1 random sticker!\n\nAdditionally, if you've chosen to add-on more stickers than the number of pins you've ordered, you can also select the design for the random sticker design!\nPast pin designs I've brought to life. From sketch ideation, to digital art, and finally to negotiations with the manufacturers, I've seen these designs through the whole process. You can expect this kind of quality with this Kickstarter project!\nThe timeliness of this project will also be based on the backers! Please submit your surveys of which pin/sticker designs you like in a timely fashion to ensure that we get everyone's preferences accounted for.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease note that all colors & designs are subject to change. I am currently designing the pins, and while the overall designs will represent what has been shown in the Kickstarter (I won't change the designs dramatically), the color palettes / small details may be altered to best suit the design.\n\nOverall, I have been selling things online for a few years now, and have created several other enamel pin designs. I've looked into a few different manufacturers and have found one that I'm happy to trust with these designs.\n\nBut as always, there can be issues with manufacturing and shipping delays. I will definitely keep you up-to-date on any new issues, though the timeline has a minor buffer accounted for these cases.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or feedback!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Helping hand", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

Nima is a combination of all my childhood influences and inspirations and I want to inject every bit of life from the grand adventures I experienced as a kid into my own personal world.\nNima\u2019s story takes place in a world with hauntingly beautiful and vibrant locations. I want Nima\u2019s world to excite people the way I was drawn into the world of Avatar the Last Airbender. I draw a lot of inspiration from anime like Full Metal Alchemist, fighting games like Super Smash Bros., and movies like Spirited Away. Nima\u2019s world will take you through an expansive and magical journey with a dynamic cast of companions, travelers, and enemies. This book will show my vision from start to finish, depicting this vivid world with scribbles, sketches, key scenes and cinematic paintings.\nEvery page will be crafted with care with a mixture of Typography, Layout, Graphic Design and Digital Illustrations.\n  The book is the first step into introducing Nima to the world.\n           SHIPPING - \nShipping will be handled through the Pledge Manager!

Although the town is rife with supernatural activity, no one else believes Dinah's claims that ghosts are coming and going through the crumbling buildings and dilapidated streets. Only Dinah's best friend, Vincent, believes her...though he's never seen any ghosts himself.\nThat all changes when a late walk through the surrounding woods lands them both on the doorstep of an otherworldly guild called the Mausoleum, located in a cemetery that seemingly comes and goes at will, and all managed more or less efficiently (if very, very strangely) by the afterlife. Accidentally committing to a job contract as a \u201chuman agent,\u201d Dinah unknowingly agrees to return every night to this supernatural waystation, where the lost souls of humans are stored and rehabilitated until they can pass on to the other side. Dinah must enter into vaults which contain the strange and surreal dreams of these ghosts and try to solve the problems that hold them back from moving on. Or, you know, die trying.\nEach vault is a separate level in the game, which Dinah has to enter, navigate and solve, a task far easier said than done. The ghosts are often unaware that they're even dead in the first place and so it's up to Dinah, and you as the player, to discover the meaning of their death and then figure out how to help that spirit pass on.\nLuckily, Dinah has a little otherworldly guidance while she's on missions, in the form of a very bizarre guild worker named Edaniel, who is a green, and is a sort of...well, in ten years, we haven't figured out what he is exactly, but maybe you can. Long-eared cat? Long-tailed bunny? Some kind of pointy monster? At any rate, he's got a fine taste in hats and terrible taste in everything else.\nAbilities and Allies\nVincent - Vincent is Dinah's childhood friend and lives in the town of Bizenghast with her. A young man whose wealthy parents are always traveling and leaving him more or less alone, he sticks with Dinah through everything, considering her his only true friend. Even though he has no contract with the Mausoleum, Vincent nevertheless volunteers to accompany Dinah every night, giving her moral support and a helping hand whenever he can. Per the rules of the Mausoleum, he can't enter the dream vaults with Dinah, but he can stay outside in the main building and assist her in other ways!\nEdaniel \u2013 Although he's often more scatterbrained and silly than helpful, Edaniel gladly escorts Dinah through the ghostly vaults and volunteers to wear a tinfoil hat, to help boost the signal of Vincent's cellphone and cut out some of the supernatural static. In addition to this, there are hidden bonus hats for the player to collect throughout the game, that each receive their own bonus audio content when Edaniel puts them on. Everything from radio plays, to afterlife broadcast announcements, to Edaniel's internal thoughts, and even a special director's commentary for the game itself! Collect all the hats and get hours and hours of bonus game content!\nDinah using her ghost vision.\nGhost vision \u2013 What everyone else assumed was a bad case of the crazies in Dinah actually turns out to be a kind of heightened intuition. When Dinah is near ghosts, or items that have been used by them, she gains a special, ghostly sight that allows her to pick up clues in her environment, perceiving the actions of the spirits around her and providing insight on where to explore next.\nVincent develops some ghostly images.\nVincent sets up a makeshift HQ and photo lab in a side room of the Mausoleum, and helps Dinah out in a number of ways:\nCell phone: Vincent has a cell that he uses to keep in contact with Dinah, although reception is spotty, due to the supernatural interference. Luckily, Edaniel wears a tin foil hat to help boost the signal, but his calls can still come in through a lot of static and may be difficult to understand at times.\nDinah calls Vincent for help.\nKnowledge: Vincent is an amateur historian and knows a ton about the town and surrounding areas. This, along with his moving of vital history books into his makeshift lab, means he can provide clues to each ghost's personal history and may be able to help Dinah along if she gets stuck.\nCamera: Occasionally, strange silhouettes appear, darting in and out of the ghost worlds. No one is sure what they are, but they point to a bigger intrigue within the Mausoleum itself. Dinah uses a disposable camera to take pictures of these creatures (since the spirits only appear on regular film) and brings them back to Vincent, who develops them in his lab and tries to piece together what's really going on.\nMap: As Dinah explores each new ghost world, she describes it to Vincent, who draws a map and helps her keep track of where she's been, where certain landmarks and items are, and he can make backtracking and retracing steps much easier.\nGameplay: When you play as Dinah in the ghost vaults you will enter a world that has been created by the ghosts imagination. The laws of physics often do not hold true and nothing is ever as it seems. Here, players will have to explore the environment, looking for clues and unlocking puzzles to discover the mystery for each ghost as to why they are tormented and cannot pass on. The reasons behind each ghosts burdened soul are unique and it is up to the player to discover the cause of each spirits death. Were they murdered? Does the spirit want revenge? How do you convince them to let go without killing their murderer? How do you help one seek closure for accidently killing their true love by unknowingly infecting them with the black plague? How do you bring justice to the kidnapped children of a crazed witch? What do you do about a young privileged girl who was accidently murdered by two of her friends? These are only a few examples of the difficult choices you will face.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Game Engine partners - Unreal Engine 4 from Epic Games\n\"We have always been huge fans of the Unreal Engine from Epic Games.

I own all of them and still vigorously recommend and loan them to friends. I've played a full campaign in the roleplaying game and created an entire city, numerous characters and the world's dankest bar just for it.

Circuit Scribe draws smooth lines with conductive silver ink and allows you to create functioning circuits instantly. \nInvent Instantly\nCircuit Scribe is for Makers of all ages and skill sets.\nSTEM Education: Circuit Scribe was made for project based learning.  Kids can build circuits and switches in their notebooks and use those concepts to get creative!\nLow-Cost High Quality Electronics: You can build a circuit with nothing but a coin battery, paper clip, and LED, or build out complex circuits with multiple components. \nFlexible Electronics: Draw your circuits, cut them out, and stuff them into your inventions - instant robot guts. \nGoodbye Breadboard: Breadboards add a level of abstraction and annoyance to circuit building.  With Circuit Scribe you can draw exactly what you want, no wires or breadboard required.\nOpen-Source Hardware: You can use Circuit Scribe with Arduino, Makey Makey, and many other electronic platforms.\nWe wanted to make creating with Circuit Scribe even easier for our KICKSTARTER backers, so we developed a series of electronic components just for you!  These components will snap directly onto the page as long as you have something magnetic behind them, such as a refrigerator door, small piece of steel, magnet, etc.  The components depicted are prototypes, the design of the final components may be a little different. \nWith Circuit Scribe schematic sketches can become instant working prototypes. Our custom electronic components snap right in to your circuits.\nWe\u2019re really excited to see what you come up with! We've been working on Circuit Scribe for a few years now, and we can't wait to take it from prototype to product!\nRight now we brew small batches of ink and fill each pen by hand.  We need KICKSTARTER\u2019s help to scale up our ink production and fill our first order of pens. We want Circuit Scribe to be affordable, so we need to manufacture them at a large scale.  We've found a USA manufacturer who will work with us to produce batches of pens, but we need your help to make it happen!  We've put together some Kits for our backers that make it easy to learn & build with Circuit Scribe. The components depicted are prototypes and will evolve as we hear your feedback and develop the final designs.  We can't wait to see what you make!   \nThank You for helping us reach our goal!  We can't wait to get Circuit Scribe out to our Backers!!\nStretch Goals: \n$250,000 - Circuit Scribe Edu Platform & STEM Outreach\nGOAL REACHED! Now we can make the robust, user-friendly, online education portal of our dreams! We are hard at work building a platform for kids, educators, & makers with activities, lesson plans, and user-submitted projects. \n$650,000 - Magnetic Sheet for Kit Activity Books & Maker Notebooks\nGOAL REACHED! A Magnetic Sheet will now be added to Activity Books and Maker Notebooks that come as part of the Classroom Kit, Maker Kit, Developer Kits, & Basic Kit + Book Rewards Levels.  If you'd like to get an additional Magnetic Sheet as part of your Reward, just add $5 to your pledge! \nYou can place the light-weight magnetic sheet under any sheet of paper and snap your components into your drawings! Check it out: \n$1,000,000 - Resistor Pen\nIf we hit $1M we can produce a Resistor Pen. The pen will let you draw resistors into your Circuit Scribe circuit sketches.

You can print out this Gift Certificate so they have something to unwrap!  Just fill in the Pledge Level to let them know what you got them.  Unfortunately we cannot ship to multiple addresses, so we'll ship the reward to you and you can deliver the gift in person.\nDownload Gift Certificate Here!\nHaving Fun With Makey Makey!\nCircuit Scribe Inventor Analisa Russo & Makey Makey Co-Inventor Eric Rosenbaum making some beats with their inventions:\nThe Story Behind Circuit Scribe\nElectroninks Incorporated is a spin-off company from the research lab of Professor Jennifer Lewis located in the Research Park at the University of Illinois.  We\u2019re all about creating low-cost, high-quality electronics. We wanted to get electronics into people's hands and thought that using things as ubiquitous as pen and paper was just the way to do it. So we've developed a non-toxic, water-based, conductive silver ink for use in rollerball pens.  Back in 2011 we published a paper in Advanced Materials: \nPen-on-Paper Flexible Electronics Analisa Russo , Bok Yeop Ahn , Jacob J. Adams , Eric B. Duoss , Jennifer T. Bernhard , and Jennifer A. Lewis.\nPress Coverage\nOur conductive ink was named Invention of the Month by Popular Science!\nAnd a video of our brewing process was featured in Chemical and Engineering News: \nPrototype Process\nWe got a ton of emails asking if we could make the pen available commercially. So we started tinkering and sending out prototype pens to Makers.  The feedback was great! Check out what Jay Edry made with the prototype:\nTechnical Details\nCircuit Scribe\nWe've done quite a bit of development work in order to make the pen you see in the videos.  The prototype pens are Sakura Gelly Roll Metallic pens.  We clean the pens by hand and refill them with the conductive silver ink.  The ink has to be precisely tuned so that it flows just the right amount of ink in order to create a conductive circuit - otherwise it spreads into the paper too quickly or doesn't flow smoothly out of the pen.   \nThe final design of the basic Circuit Scribe pen will look similar to the prototype displayed here and in the video.  We plan to purchase the parts directly from Sakura or partner with them outright to manufacture the pens.  The quality of the pen and the reasonable price make this the ideal choice for our ink. The rollerball pen design works really well, is cost effective, and we love the utilitarian simplicity of it.  It also writes for a while (60-80 meters).  The written lines achieve a conductivity of 50-100 milliohms per square per mil.  \nComponents: \nThe final components will look very similar to the prototype components in the video & photos.  We're working with a USA based manufacturer to produce these components and get them to you on time!\n The LED component contains two different-colored LEDs, if you flip the component to change the direction of the current, the other LED will light up: \n You can add your own resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and many other components to our 2 PIN board:\nWhat would you build with Circuit Scribe?

Michael is also in charge of manufacturing components. His background is in computer and mechanical engineering, with extensive experience manufacturing electromechanical devices.\nSteve Shewchuk: Electroninks Incorporated Intern and UIUC MatSE Undergrad\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nBok Yeop Ahn: Ink developer and post-doc in the Lewis Research Group. Bok created an early version of the colloidal silver ink now used in Circuit Scribe and has been a long-time mentor for our rollerball pen research.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with many Kickstarter projects, we face several key risks and challenges by pursuing production of this pen. Primary risks include:\n\nENGINEERING\n\nIn order for the pen to work very easily for the end-user, we have spent a considerable amount of time designing and optimizing the ink to work reliably in the rollerball pen. As we work with a manufacturer to take Circuit Scribe from prototype to product, we will need to ensure that the functionality and reliability of the pen are never compromised. \n\nLOGISTICS\n\nThis is perhaps the largest challenge of them all. Right now we produce the ink and load the pens on our lab, which means we have direct control over the quality of our product and our production timetables. In order to produce a large run of pens, several manufacturers must work in tandem to make this project a reality, which introduces many variables, potential complications and potential timeline setbacks. We will work directly with contract manufacturers to produce and optimize the ink, we will also work with pen manufacturers to produce and package the pens after the ink has been produced, and finally, we will work with the pen manufacturer to make sure the pens achieve the quality necessary for a finished consumer product that will write easily and reliably while producing conductive traces that dry quickly at room temperature. We already have a working relationship with the contacts listed to speed to development and manufacturing process to ensure timely delivery to our backers. Delivering a high quality product to our KICKSTARTER Backers is our number one priority.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Beautiful paper circuits from Papier Machine", "update_content": "Hey Y'all,\nWe made some new friends last year over at Papier Machine and they've just launched a new project in Kickstarter we're very excited about and thought you may be curious as well.

Intercut with scenes from our home life and backstage footage, \"Baby Daddy\" goes beyond the standard stand up comedy special and documents the creation of our unconventional trio, and how ultimately love defines a family. \n\"Baby Daddy\" was performed live in Los Angeles and New York City and won the prestigious Bistro award and was nominated for a GLAAD  and United Solo award for best off Broadway solo show.

Does the filmed version capture the experience of having attended an actual performance? Unhappily, these are all risks I've encountered before. \n\nThere's also a chance of possible delays in post-production. We are doing everything possible to bring this in on time for you.\n\nI've assembled an A-list group of technical talent. From my director of photography Ian McGlocklin to my director Andrea James I've put together a creative team of people who are experts in their field. This is a trouble shooting group capable of handling any technical glitches should they arise. Your funding will help me pay this team, who in turn will deliver a documentary that looks and sounds terrific. \n\nThe other challenge is finding our audience. Again,your funding will help me produce a network quality special that hopefully finds its home and audience on the internet. I've been able to build a loyal fan base and a successful career by creating previous standup shows and portraying memorable characters.
