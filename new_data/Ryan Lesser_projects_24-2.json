Randomly generated levels and encounters make every playthrough a unique experience!\n A Thematic Roguelike Experience - An engaging game profoundly inspired by roguelikes and old-school dungeon crawlers. Every floor is randomly laid out, each game plays out differently, and of course, death is final.\nMinimal Setup - This game takes seconds to set up and makes for quick, tense dungeon romps.\nMake Choices - Will you spend your coins at the Merchant's stall for some health points, or choose to fight the Skeleton Soldier for some much-needed experience points before facing greater odds? Many more dilemmas await you!\nNew Co-op Mode - You can now enlist a fellow friend to help you out on the quest to retrieve the Og's Blood!\nBetter than Ever - Manipulations have been streamlined, the difficulty has been balanced, and new unique cards make for unexpected encounters.\nNew Characters  - Will you conjure powerful potions as the Mage, or play as the sneaky Rogue with deadly hands? Each Character comes with unique skills!   \nIf you want to pledge for additional content, you can see all the details in Add-ons and Shipping sections below.\n\n If you want to receive the Old Gods expansion with your additional copy of Mini Rogue, you can look to the Shipping section of this page (there is an explanation about how to add additional pledges like Leather Armor, Chainmail or Plate Armor).

Dragoon: The Rogue and Barbarian Expansion was then funded in 2017 with 3,627 backers (who were also awesome people). New to Dragoon? There are a number of videos in the VIDEOS section below that explain the game!\nIn Dragoon take on the role of fire breathing gold hoarding dragons, dominating and destroying the stupid humans that keep showing up on your island with their precious gold. The Rogue & Barbarian Expansion adds 2 asymmetric characters with their own unique ways of traversing the island and amassing gold. Since then we have expanded the Dragoon story with our latest game Life Siphon, where humans flee the uninhabitable surface in hopes of a curse-free lifestyle in the undoubtedly cursed depths of the mined island. In Might and Magma, exploit the folly of humans that brought about the destruction of the surface and the disturbance of an ancient power that had lain dormant, until now.\nOddly satisfying...\n\nSince the first iteration of Dragoon, we've wanted to do a new map. There have been talks off and on for the past few years, but we are now finally doing it! Introducing The Liquid Gold Map!\nNick Nazzaro really built in some amazing detail in this piece. At 26\" x 16\" with gold ink and heavy canvas, this is going to be the ultimate Dragoon combination of art and quality.\nIn order to make this map truly something special, we are working closely with a friend from inside the board game industry, Ross Cowman. We saw his work on The Fall of Magic and knew he was the perfect person to collaborate with.\nImages of Ross's game The Fall of Magic. And his face!\nRoss is currently working out the best method for our map that will work smoothly with Nick Nazzaro's design. As samples are made, he will provide us with images and video of the process.\nAll of our games and merch will be available in BackerKit after the campaign ends. Below are all the Dragoon items being offered.\nPlease check our website before committing to add-ons. You may be able to order the items there and get them now! But if you want to bundle shipping, this Kickstarter is the way to go.\nIt turns out that the humans mining the cursed depths of impending peril in search of more gold was somehow not a good idea.\nAs volcanic activity shakes the land, something far worse seems to have awoken amidst the chaos. Now the island\u2019s already most tyrannical are granted strange new powers from an unseen source beneath the island.\nTHE VOLCANOS\nThese lava spewing mountains loom with the threat of destruction and the promise of unearthing gold mines.\n1. Setup: Place the 2 volcanoes and 2 fault lines in predetermined locations on the map. Shuffle the Lava Flow deck and reveal the top card.\n2. Activation: While standing on a dormant volcano or fault line, a free action will activate it and send you home or off the map. This volcano will explode at the end of the round!\n3. Destruction: After Tribute, any active volcanoes erupt by placing lava tiles on the map according to the face up lava flow card. Villages and cities covered in lava create gold mines!\n4. Gold Mines: Unlike lava that only lasts one round, gold mines stick around until they are mined by a player. Each action spent yields 3 gold with no limit, and are immediately removed after being mined. Make \u2018em count!\nTHE POWER DECK\nEvery character gains access to this potent source of new abilities.\n1. SETUP: Shuffle the power deck and then just let it be, emanating power.\n2. Gain power: At the start of your turn draw a power card if you don\u2019t have one already. If you do, then don\u2019t touch it!\n3. Use power: Each Power Card costs 1 action to play and results in a range of undisputedly awesome things. All power cards can only be used during your own turn.\nThe best prices we've ever offered\nNo Stretch Goals\nNo Kickstarter Exclusives\nNo FOMO\nWhat does COMPLETE AT LAUNCH mean? We are offering you the best game at the best price possible from the start. All gameplay elements and anything else that would have been a stretch goal is simply included in the game from day one. Kickstarter Exclusives do not exist on this campaign.\nBut what if we think of something awesome mid campaign? Or backers make a sweet suggestion? Then we will just give it to you if possible. No stretch goals to reach it. You'll just get an update that says you are getting a cool thing.\nBut what about sweet Kickstarter Exclusives? We want everyone to enjoy the products we create, and it feels like a punishment for someone to miss out just because they weren't on Kickstarter at the right time.

This ensures you get charged the shipping you deserve based on your total order. No more, no less. By doing this, we are able to factor in your pledge tier, add-ons, and all fancy things that may occur during the campaign. However, we can offer estimated shipping costs.

It introduces you to the world of Ealand, an island ablaze with conflict, tearing itself apart in the decaying shadow of its once great cultures. Foes set foot upon its shores almost daily, while the land, its people and its gods lash out with the fury of a cornered animal. Within this cauldron of strife, Ealand is a fertile soil for adventure. Where there is death, there is opportunity. Where there is pain, there is profit. Where the fathers cower and the mothers wail, there is room for legends to be born.  \nWhat it contains \nAll you need to set adventures, campaigns and encounters on the war torn isle of Ealand \nHistory, customs and cultures for 6 distinct humanoid races living on the isle\n5 unique \u2018Other Folk\u2019 races including the beautiful shapeshifting Vugael and the trickster Dwellers\nA thorough guide to the major peoples and places of Ealand, leaving just enough room for creativity and exploration\nMaps showing the islands varied landscapes and main conflicts\n15+ tables to randomly generate everything from petty tyrants to grave curses\n20+ original creatures for adventurers to encounter,  \nDetailed story seeds and plot points to inspire great and harrowing adventures\nA comprehensive primer on warfare of all types in this dark and terrible age allowing intricate and nuanced adventures in the thick of armed conflict\nSample encounter locations\nInformation on the technology, weapons, architecture and even the burial rights of the people of Ealand \n35+ Original drawings immersing readers in this isle of strife\nBackground\nThe island of Ealand is a shadow of what it was. The builders once raised colossal structures to the skies and created homes of luxury and order. Now all that they erected lays crumbling and broken. Hollowed out and used by brutish men to dominate each other in conflicts over Ealand\u2019s corpse. This is a world already used to bloodshed that has been set ablaze in a war for its very identity. The Saevolk stream in from the sea, extending Volkland deeper and deeper into the island in the slow inexorable march of invasion. With steel and fire, sword and shield, they kill all who stand in their path. The Huus, who should unite to protect their own way of life, squabble and scheme taking every opportunity to settle old scores. The land itself writhes in anger, with all the beasts and spirits of the wild in open hostility with the world of man. \nTo adventure in Ealand is to traffic in conflict. To forge your legend in the fires of strife. With war comes opportunity for the brave, the clever, the remorseless and the perceptive. Whichever side of the great conflicts you choose. Battles big and small. Clashes of armies on the field and the tangling of desperate bodies brawling in the smoky mead halls. Whether you\u2019re a Saevolk raider, a brave Huus warrior or even a greedy Guldyn mercenary loyal only to gold, your story can unfold in a myriad of directions. Healers or scholars. Warrior poets or treasure hunters. It matters crucially who you count as friend and foe, and who stands beside you when cold steel is drawn. This island contains all that is needed to gather the fame and honor that will echo through the ages. \nFor the players and game masters who choose to set their stories in Ealand, you must understand this is a harsh world, a dark world, but one that can contain beauty and triumph as well. The major themes are conflict between the human races, and conflict with nature. The goal was to create a world that supported complex motivations, difficult situations and enormous fields of moral grey area for players to navigate. I wanted a world that was different. That embraced tales centered on violence between humans but also allowed for plenty of stories about the party against the land itself. A group of adventures can immerse themselves in very real anger between men, or ignore that entirely and adventure against the great beasts and monsters of the wild. \nSystem-Neutral\nThis setting is system-neutral, which means it can be used with your favorite fantasy roleplaying ruleset, whatever that happens to be. Simply put, I wanted this world to be accessible to anyone who wants to explore it, regardless of their preferred game. Works with everything from 5e to Lamentations and DCCRPG. \nHow do I use it? \nUsing this book is easy. You can set an adventure or campaign on the Isle of Ealand taking the setting, characters, and monsters utilizing them to tell engaging tales of danger and menace. Characters would be insiders to this world. Well steeped in the islands history, traditions and people. Ealand is their home either by birth or adoption, and it encompasses much of their world, as islands often do to their people. Another option is to take Ealand and place it in an existing game world. This can be a published setting or an original creation, Ealand can slot into either quite easily. As an island, with its own unique beliefs, geography and cultures, it can just exist in a larger world, somewhere Northwest from a continent, in a cold and unforgiving sea. Adventurers can happen upon its mist-covered shores by accident or assignment. Many great stories can be spun with a foreign party coming to grips with what they don\u2019t understand trapped in an ancient land perpetually in turmoil. Finally, and probably most simply, you can just read the book and pluck whatever ideas you want from it to sprinkle into your own game. There is no law saying the bog-dwelling FennHulm or the Storm Dancers of Ealand cannot live somewhere else. The mysterious and cursed magical artifacts of the Saevolk don\u2019t need to be found only in the geographical confines of the isle. Imagine the book as a thickly wooded path to be wandered down, stopping and admiring what you find interesting. \nHowever you intend to use the book, I welcome you to this world and its people. May you participate in epic tales with great friends wherever you gather.\n Reward Tiers\nStandard - Print + PDF Version \nThe book (roughly 112 pages perfect bound softcover)  \nPDF \nSpecial KickStarter Exclusive Version \nThe book (roughly 112 pages perfect bound softcover)  \nPDF\nPrint #1 (Artwork from the book)\nPrint #2 (Map of the island) \nRaffle entry for piece of original art from game\nMembership in exclusive group that gets early access to content related to Ruin & Conquest\nName listed in roll of honor in book \nPledging for Multiple Copies\nIf you've like multiple copies of either the Standard or Special Edition rewards, just pledge for a multiple of that amount and we'll get you the right number of copies when they're ready to ship.

All of this has been done out of pocket on the side of my actual day job. And guess what, the book is looking awesome! But it is important to remember, it could be even better. Kickstarter allows Ruin & Conquest to be expanded if the demand is there for it. It lets me add additional art for the book and commission more maps/locations to be illustrated (things I can\u2019t do myself). I\u2019m not looking to get rich off this niche release, or become a full time game developer. This is a passion project, and anything it makes goes back into increasing the value in the book (or funding the next one). Ruin & Conquest is great in its current planned form, really something I\u2019m proud to release and put my name on, but if enough people back it, I can make it even better. \nInspiration \nThis book was inspired by a number of sources... \nClassic RPG's of the 80's and early 90's and their focus on creativity, storytelling and incredible art\nMythology and folklore always hinting at a mysterious world just out of sight \nPunk and it's DIY attitude about just making the things you want to see in the world \nHistory and its limitless inspiration\nStretch Goals\n$7,000 - Additional Art throughout the book\n$9,000 - New location maps and encounter maps included in the book\n$12,000 - Mini adventure included in book \nArtists \nRich Nerdgore  -  artofnerdgore \nJamie Jordan - noirfade\nAdam Chandler - hollowxsky\n Reza Afshar -  rezaa_afsharr \n Andrea Piparo  -  andreapiparoart \n Dale Sarok -  dsarok \n Brian Profilio -  b.profilio.art \n Lucas Ruggiero  -  lr_illustration \n Masruron Nihayanto  -  moronfathers \n Ahot -  ahot.74 \n Andrew k Mar -  andrewkmar \n Matt Stikker -  bargainbinblasphemy \n Sean O'Neill -  babyfaceoneill \n Ryan Breceda  -  ryanbreceda \n Theoretical Part -  theoreticalpart\n Joe Wildling -  oldwoden \n Daniel Shaw -  shaw.illustrations ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a relatively straightforward project to deliver, although Kickstarters always carry some amount of risk.

The 12\" Braising Pan from Nest Homeware is finally here! It's the next great piece in our collection of beautiful, smooth-surfaced, cast iron cookware. \nJust like the rest of our collection, its handles are designed as abstractions of Cherry branches. They've been meticulously sculpted to both look beautiful and feel great in your hands. \nHandle design matters. Comfort is key...\nMost cast iron pans only have one handle, no matter the size, but this can make cooking clumsy and uncomfortable. Trying to lift a single-handled cast iron pan full of food can put a ton of strain on your wrist. The two handles on our 12\" Braising Pan keep everything in balance so you can enjoy cooking. They have ample room for easy lifting, as they've actually been designed with hands in mind!\nMachined Smooth\nNest was among the first companies to set the new standard in cast iron cookware - a cooking surface that's entirely machined smooth. Unlike some other companies, we go the extra mile - machining the cooking surface all the way up the sidewalls. \nAnd this goes for all of our cookware - even our Dutch Oven. A smooth surface has less texture for food to stick to which makes for the best cooking experience that you can have - even heating, perfect searing, and easy clean up. Your eggs will do more than slide - they'll flip!\nDouble-seasoned with Flaxseed Oil\nMany typical cast iron pans are seasoned quickly with low grade oil blends and scorched at high temperatures, turning them black. This gives them the appearance of an older piece of cookware, but it doesn't really help your cooking. \nEach piece from Nest Homeware is double-seasoned by hand with flaxseed oil, and ready to cook with right out of the box. We take extra care to season at two different temperatures as well - one geared more for the exterior surface, and one specially chosen for the smooth interior. This makes our seasoning a great base for you to continue to build on over years to come. \nOur seasoning process gives our cookware a lustrous, bronzey hue. This is your base to start from. With time and use, your cookware will darken and deepen to a rich and lovely black. A good relationship with cast iron takes effort over time, but it's incredibly rewarding. \nA brand new 9\" Skillet on the left, a well used 9\" Skillet on the right.\nCast Iron is forever!\nIf something is going to last forever, it shouldn't just work well - it should be beautiful.\nPhotography by Melissa Stimpson, Rue Sakayama, Tiffany Howard, Angel Tucker, and Matt Cavallaro.\n Rewards!\nWe've got some great stuff to give you in thanks for your support.\nExtra large tote bag (18\"x20\") with lots of room, perfect for the market.\nThis little Cookbooklet has a recipe for each piece of our cookware.

We're excited to work with the folks at BackerKit to streamline the entire process post campaign. Their system allows backers to easily upgrade pledges, add add-ons, change your shipping address, and so much more.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends to ensure each backer is charged appropriately for what they order. Shipping cast iron is no joke, and at this point, we've gotten pretty good at it. We've also shipped enough that UPS smiles upon us with some extra savings, which we can pass along to you!\nRetail\nAre you a retailer? Interested in carrying Nest Homeware in your store?

Cultists are summoning one of the Elder Ones to consume our world, and it is up to the ragtag group of investigators to face the nightmarish forces and disrupt the ritual long enough to make the Elder One vulnerable. And then kill it dead.\nFind out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Season 2 Expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, Art Book, Extra Dice, Frost Dice.\nDesigned by Rob Daviau and Eric M. Lang, the game features monster artwork by Adrian Smith and investigator artwork by Karl Kopinski. Investigators come from all walks of life, each bringing a unique skill to the team, as well as two other generic skills.\nArt by Karl Kopinski, sculpts by RN Estudio.\nMadness is always at your side when battling unthinkable monstrosities from other dimensions. In fact, the investigators already start the game with a diagnosed insanity, which will will be triggered by your encounters with the occult. You may be doomed by your mental breakdown, or learn to use it to your advantage. The closer you are to losing your mind completely, the more powerful your skills will become.\nArt by Filipe Pagliuso.\nSummoning the Elder Gods are fanatic cultists, and the hosts of nightmarish monstrosities aiding  them in their cause. Each of these enemies possesses its own special ability and combat strength. They are not controlled by any player, but instead have their behavior triggered by Mythos cards used for each specific episode.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Sculpts by Thierry Masson, Yannick Hennebo, Remy Tremblay, Michael Jenkins, Edgar Skomorowski, and Jose Roig.\nThe Death May Die core box contains smaller boxes that hold the modular elements to create each unique game session. Players choose one of the two available Elder Ones and combine their contents with those of one of the six available Episodes. Each of these boxes contain unique figures, tokens, and cards that are only used when playing with those elements. The Mythos deck used in each game is a combination of cards from the chosen Elder One box and the chosen Episode box. Each Episode not only indicates the map setup using the various tiles in the game, but also new actions the investigators can perform in order to accomplish the tasks required to disrupt that episode's ritual. They each also bring their own Discovery cards for players to explore, and the monsters' behaviors and abilities are tailored to each unique story.\nHastur, known as the King in Yellow, and his disciples brand the world with their terrible Yellow Sign. Those that suffer this doom quickly meet their fate by the hands of death or madness.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Disciple sculpt by Thierry Masson. Hastur sculpt by JAG.\nCthulhu, The Thing That Should Not Be, will bring his sunken kingdom of R'lyeh into our world, plunging the earth into a nightmarish reality.\nArt by Adrian Smith. Cthulhu sculpt by Michael Jenkins. Star Spawn sculpt by Aragorn Marks.\nThe Elder Ones start the game off the board; as they move along the summoning track their growing presence invites chaos and insanity into the world to accompany their grand awakening. Eventually they cross over and the real nightmare begins. If the investigators have managed to disrupt the ritual, the Elder One becomes vulnerable and may (just possibly) be killed for good. If not, the investigators now have to contend with an immortal behemoth hunting them while they try to accomplish their tasks. Either way, killing the Elder One will not be easy, not by a long shot, as each time it's bested it grows more enraged and powerful. In the end, either all investigators will fall or death will come for the Great Old One.\nInvestigators, Cultists, Star Spawn, Cthulhu and Hastur painted by Robert Karlsson. Byakee, Deep One, Ghoul, and Shoggoth painted by Fabrizio Russo. Cthonian, Fire Vampire, and Hunting Horror painted by Angel Giraldez. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nIn their mission to thwart the cultist's plans, investigators engage in more than combat. If they can get some respite, they can discover all sorts of things to potentially help them in their tasks. Discovery cards are unique to each Episode, and present the investigators with challenges or choices that will grant them different resources, companions or negative effects.\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box comes with:\n45 Highly-Detailed Plastic Figures\n17 Terrain Tiles\n30 Plastic Tentacle Tokens\n8 Custom Dice\n5 Counter Bases\n10 Investigator Dashboards\n186 Cards\n120 Tokens\n1 Rulebook\nWIP Rulebook\nPlease be aware that this is a Work In Progress Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements.\nUnspeakable Pledge - $100\nBackers with an Unspeakable Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nSculpt by RN Estudio. Painting by Robert Karlsson.\nJulia is an incredibly level-headed investigator. Given the extraordinary circumstances she finds herself in, it's amazing how she can keep her wits about her. Her unique skill allows her to take wounds instead of stress, greatly increasing her chances of success in any given encounter. Though it may cost her life in the end...\nR'lyeh Rising Pledge - $250\nBackers with a R'lyeh Rising Pledge will receive a copy of the Cthulhu: Death May Die core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive R'lyeh Rising expansion, and the Kickstarter Exclusive Investigator Julia, plus all applicable Stretch Goals.\nAs the production of this statue is extremely expensive and time-consuming, delivery of it will be staggered. However, all backers will receive the rest of the base pledge at the same time. \nCheck out THIS UPDATE for for answers to some pressing questions, extra gameplay information, and shipping cost estimates.\nLet's not be coy, the heart and soul of the R'lyeh Rising expansion is its colossal figure of Cthulhu! This cyclopean creation is something never before seen in the world of board gaming. Its base is 44 x 44 cm wide, and it stands 57 cm tall to the tip of its wings. In fact, this thing is so huge that his base becomes the board on which the game is played! This plastic statue was sculpted in terrifying detail and will come pre-assembled, with the exception of the clip-on wings, so it can be proudly displayed for all to see.\nSculpt by Remy Tremblay (Julia figure included for scale).\nR'lyeh Rising is a wholly unique Episode, the epic finale to Death May Die, not only bringing its own set of tokens, Discovery cards, Monster cards, and Mythos cards, but also drastic changes to the game's base rules, as the figures move and act freely upon the behemoth's rocky base.\nPainting by Angel Giraldez (Cultist figures included for scale).\nPLEASE NOTE ALL FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON team dives into a gameplay overview of Death May Die with Episode 1 - Blasphemous Alchemy:\nFind out more about the Season 2 Expansion HERE.\nFind out more about the Black Goat of the Woods HERE. \nFind out more about the Art Book HERE.\nFind out more about the Extra Dice HERE.\nFind out more about the Frost Dice HERE.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world).

Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 32nd Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is July 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, Massive Darkness, The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun, and Zombicide: Green Horde. A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game is currently shipping to backers.\n\nWe have three ongoing projects currently: HATE, Zombicide: Invader, and Arcadia Quest: Riders, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Cthulhu: Death May Die.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Unspeakable Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8,241 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["196 backers", "Limited (4 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "Delivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,341 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 220 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "250 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 225 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 230 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 235 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 245 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "100 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "R'lyeh Rising Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nCthulhu: Death May Die core box\nJulia exclusive investigator\nR'lyeh Rising (giant Cthulhu) exclusive expansion\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "200 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "The Unspeakable Last Hours of CMON Comics!", "update_content": "I\u00e4!

I\u2019m Sam, an artist focused on work that explores our inner, emotional worlds. Much of my childhood was spent alone in the woods or exploring the possibilities of dreams. I\u2019ve drawn on these personal experiences to create a visual language of dark nature, hypnagogic patterns, and moody atmospheres.\nThe Blood Moon Tarot is a project being brought to life by over 10 years of experience using the tarot and over 2 years of work on the deck itself. I believe tarot\u2019s marriage of art and symbolism make it a powerful tool for examining ourselves and our circumstances. This deck explores my personal interpretations of the cards in my own visual language, making it quite different from the iconic imagery of the Rider-Waite deck. With this deck I hope to encourage others to sit with their struggles, learn how to navigate the emotional landscapes within themselves, and connect with the mystery of the world around them.\nThe Blood Moon Tarot will be a complete deck featuring a fully illustrated Major Arcana and Minor Arcana. Much of my personal imagery is rich with nature, flowing lines, and earthy color palettes. I'm nearly done the Major Arcana (only The World remains) and I have the sketches for the Minor Arcana cards done and am currently finalizing the drawings so that I can paint. I\u2019ll be sharing my progress on the Minor Arcana as the kickstarter takes place, so look for updates as the campaign progresses! I plan to have the art done and the deck ready to print by August so that I can have everyone's packages to them by the winter holidays.\nThe current card specs are: 2.75 \" x 4.75\", 350gsm, matte finish, gilded edges, foil card backs, in a tuck box.\nThe suits of the Minor Arcana have been changed to Songs (cups), Skins (wands), Dreams (swords), and Honey (pentacles) to reflect the symbolic themes that I\u2019ve used. The individual suits are each comprised of one large painting which will be cropped to the individual cards, making that suit interconnected when laid out.\n A preview of the Minor Arcana sketches... keep an eye out here for updates during the campaign!\nThe Basic, Deluxe, Book, and Sketch & Deck tiers all come with an accompanying digital booklet which includes my meanings for each card as well as 3 unique tarot spreads created for the deck. Stretch goals come with each tier, but certain items will only be available for those who pledge at the Deluxe level and up. You can switch tiers anytime before the campaign ends or purchase additional stretch goal items through Pledgemanager after the campaign has funded (this will work if you want to order an extra deck as well).\nThe Original Art tiers offer original watercolor paintings from the Blood Moon Tarot*. Each one is watercolor and a genuine precious stone pigment on 140lb hot press watercolor paper. They measure approximately 6\" x 10\u201d and have been matted to 12\" x 16\".  These tiers also include a Blood Moon Tarot deck, the digital booklet, and all other stretch goal items that are available in the deluxe tiers. See details below:\n*Please note that when purchasing original art the rights remain with the artist.\nThe majority of my funding goal goes towards the costs of having the first run of the Blood Moon Tarot printed. A small amount of the funds will cover the costs of shipping those decks to me, Kickstarter's fees and processing fees, and I have a little safety net for any miscellaneous expenses that may occur. \nOnce we\u2019ve hit the funding goal I\u2019ll be adding stretch goals. These goals, when reached, will allow me to use the extra funds to make this deck special through additions such as upgrading the paper, adding gold foil to the back of the cards, or items such as beautiful art boxes to store your deck in.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nUNLOCKED $15,000 Paper stock will be upgraded for the Blood Moon Tarot, this upgrade is applied to ALL tier levels.\nUNLOCKED $18, 000 Gold gilded edges for the Blood Moon Tarot, this upgrade is applied to ALL tier levels.\nUNLOCKED $20, 000 8\" x 10\" gold foil print of the card back design, this upgrade is applied to DELUXE tier levels and up (Deluxe x2 tier will receive 2).\nUNLOCKED $23,000 Gold foil added to the card back design for the Blood Moon Tarot, this upgrade is applied to ALL tiers.\nUNLOCKED $25,000 2 extra tarot spreads, sketches, and color palettes will be added to the digital booklet, this upgrade is applied to ALL tiers.\nUNLOCKED $35, 000 I\u2019ll be adding tarot cloths to the DELUXE tiers and up (Deluxe x2 tier will receive 2)! It\u2019ll be an extension of the art from the card back covering the fabric from edge to edge. The design will be gold ink on black cotton and measure 24\" x 24\".\nUNLOCKED $40,000 I\u2019ll be adding a beautiful, art-covered magnetic box to protect your cards! These will be included in the DELUXE tiers and up (Deluxe x2 tier will receive 2)!\nUNLOCKED $45,000 I\u2019ll be adding gold foil to the beautiful, art-covered magnetic box from the previous tier! The art will be an elaboration of the the design on the card back, so the gold foil will bring it all together.\nUNLOCKED $50,000 The physical book will now be hardcover!\nMore to come...\nI plan to charge shipping through Pledgemanager after the campaign is funded - below are the final shipping costs...\nTo ensure the process of getting your rewards to you goes smoothly, here are some notes that will help us to avoid potential delays:\nPlease be sure you use an email address that is valid and frequently checked. When the Kickstarter is over a survey will be sent out to collect any information I might need to get your rewards to you. I will not be able to send you your reward until you fill out the survey.  \nPlease be sure your address is correctly spelled and in the proper format. If your package is returned to me due to an invalid address, you will have to repay for shipping. I also am unable to ship to international PO Boxes, if this is an issue ask a friend or relative if you can have your reward shipped to them.  \nPlease be sure your credit card info is up to date or your pledge will not go through when the funding ends.  \nPlease note that though I do my best to keep shipping prices as low as possible, shipping rates are beyond my control and international shipping can be quite expensive. Also note that you are responsible for any international customs fees that may occur and I can not send my packages as anything other than merchandise.  \nThank you!\nIf you\u2019d like to read more about the process of making this deck you can explore my project countdown or find process videos here.

Neighbors cleaned up after their dogs. Graffiti rarely used offensive language. PTA meeting attendance was high. Then, the Disaster struck. Now, Steel City is a mere shadow of its former glory. Roving bands of thugs terrorize honest citizens. Evil corporations dump toxic waste in the street. PTA meeting attendance is low.\nTired and fed up, a few brave Steel City heroes have banded together to stem the tide of carnage. YOU are one of those heroes. YOU will clean up these STREETS OF STEEL.\nSidescrollin' in action!\nYou can change the difficulty in STREETS OF STEEL the only way you know how: more quarters! Do you think you can beat the game with no quarters? Or is easy mode more your style, dropping em by the fistful?\nNo matter the situation, every brawler is going to need some rules to clean up these streets. Here is a link to the rules document. If you hate reading and only care about smashing baddies, use this video!\nWhen it comes to gaming, we like to give players choices. So we are including a tier with pixel standees and another with both standees and miniatures. Do you want to pixel goodness? Or are those sweet minis calling your name?\nPlastic or Pixels... you get to choose!\nYour hero may get beat up in game, but their miniature will always remain immaculate. Sculpted to a \"heroic\" 32mm scale, each miniature has been carefully crafted to reflect it's pixel partner. We will be using 100 durometer plastic for the crispest, sturdiest minis.\nOh you're here for the pixel perfection? Well we have you covered! The pixel standees for heroes and baddies are nothing short of glorious and might even get you into the game even more. If you get both, you can play however you want each time, or if you are a real crazy punk, mix and match.\n ALL PLEDGE TIERS INCLUDE STRETCH GOALS!\nWe have lots of stretch goals planned! As we hit one, we will unlock the next. Let's keep these streets rollin'! \nSTRETCH GOALS ARE INCLUDED IN EVERY TIER!\n  If you would like add-ons, you can add the funds to your pledge, or wait until the BackerKit pledge manager releases and shop there. You may buy multiples of any/all add-ons.\nBelow you will find links to our social media pages and some sweet profile pics for you to rep your street cred!\n                                          Wild Power Games was founded in 2014 and had 2 successful Kickstarter campaigns under Ryan's personal Kickstarter account. The first was for High Heavens, and the second for the Egyptian expansion of High Heavens. Sleep easy hero, because you are in good hands. We have done this before. Check out those minis!\nRyan Lesser, Founder & Designer - Ryan is a game designer, musician and visual artist living in Providence. A graduate of Rhode Island School of Design, he has been creating video games since 1996 and is best known for his design and art direction on such influential games as Guitar Hero and Rock Band. During his 18+ years as Art Director and Creative Lead, he helped to create the patented 3D musical interface that would be used in many of Harmonix\u2019s music-based games. Ryan also co-founded Wild Power Games in 2014, where he is developing and crowdfunding board games and video games such as High Heavens and Streets Of Steel.\n\nMatt Moore, Designer - Matt Moore is a RISD and Harmonix alum who worked on Guitar Hero, Rock Band and Dance Central. To relax, he pops out chits for board games.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends to ensure each backer is charged appropriately for what they order. For example, if you order one game, your shipping will be less than someone who ordered 500 games. But don't order 500 games. That is silly.\nAt this time, we can give you estimates based on the quotes we have received for the game. The following is shipping for one copy of STREETS OF STEEL.\nYou want to know if we will have a pledge manager? You bet your ass we will have one! We are spending so much time kicking baddies to the curb that we can't worry about spreadsheets!\nWe have used BackerKit before and absolutely love working with them. Their system allows backers to easily upgrade pledges, add add-ons, change shipping address, and so much more. They have our butts covered!\nAre you a retailer? Hell yea! You rock! Keep it up! Loud noises! Maybe some face mashing heroes on your shelves will make the shop even nicer. Streets of Steel has a huge appeal to people looking for a kick of nostalgia, but also for the newer crew of gamers wanting some fresh old school badassness.\nIf you would like a copy of Street of Steel, please pledge any dollar amount to the campaign. Post campaign, you will complete your order by selecting how many copies you want, and paying off the remaining balance.\nSupporting FLGS is very important to us, and we want to do everything possible to help you thrive and grow. We are in this together!\n\nEach copy has an MSRP of $65 and you will receive your copies in the first wave of shipping to backers.\nFrom the bottom of our pixelated and not anatomically shaped hearts, thank you to our family, friends, and all the artists who worked on the game.

I started recording this record in November of 2017 and finished recording in February of this year.  I have often described my music compositionally as a series of tangles, webs and layers. Musically, this project follows in similar footsteps as my other noise/no-wave/avant-garde/experimental bands, but these compositions are entirely instrumental, using just my guitar to create the loops and layers (as well as some pre-programmed drum beats). You might describe my music as a cross between Brian Eno and Akira Ifukube (Godzilla composer), thrown into a broken blender and spit out in a noisy pile of metal fragments. \nI want to release this on vinyl because I am a bit of an old school musician in the sense that a record isn't truly finished until it is set to wax. I love holding a record in my hand and putting it on the turntable and placing the needle on the groove. And I believe that this record should be heard that way. \n*Funding cost for this record is for a pressing of 250 LPs. So this will be a limited release.\nInvertebrate Waltz track listing:\n1. The Swamp Thing Shuffle\n2. Invertebrate Waltz\n3. That Incident With The Wasp's Nest\n4. Silverfish\n5. One Hundred Tiny Spiders\nTotal length: 30 minutes\nInvertebrate Waltz, title track from the new album:\nHistory: \nI have been a professional musician for 24 years as a member of the internationally recognized touring bands: Doomsday Student, Arab on Radar and Athletic Automaton. I am presently a member of Doomsday Student.\nChrome Jackson (2008-present)\nChrome Jackson, Live at Firehouse 13, 2009\nhttps://chromejackson.bandcamp.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ChromeJackson/\nI started Chrome Jackson in 2008. Since then I have released one split 7\" w/ noise artist Diagram A (Spooky Tree Records) in 2009, and a full length titled Chrome Forest in 2011 (5nakefork Records). \nSplit 7\" w/ Diagram A\n Split 7\" Review:\n7 Inches: New Reviews Every Day\nChrome Forest LP\nChrome Forest Review:\nhttps://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/chrome-jackson-chrome-forest\n\"They said that when Keith Moon made a solo record in the 1970s, he decided to make a straight-up rock album with a full band instead of a project strictly for percussionists, which would have suited his skills better. I\u2019m not sure about all that, but I have noticed a lot of GUITAR-ONLY LPs coming out of all shapes and sizes. You got yer Mick Barr/Crom-Tech/Ocrilim, yer Six Organs Of Admittance/James Blackshaw, yer Plante\u2026 all three put out six-string-salute albums without accompaniment, and all three manage to make the format stick.\nChrome Jackson, nee Stephen Mattos of Arab On Radar (not to mention Athletic Automation, The Chinese Stars, Doomsday Student), takes the Han Solo route too. No bass. No drums. No singer (in fact, fuck singers). Just a man and his plan, squaring off against those who would find his aims gratuitous. Luckily, via his founding membership of AOR, Mattos has already been in a band people hate, so since then, he\u2019s been free to go where he wants to go and do what he wants to do. In my eyes, he\u2019s been successful in all his projects since Arab On Radar folded, and thus it\u2019s not surprising I view Chrome Forest, under the nom de plume Chrome Jackson, as another positive step for a musician who obviously has more to say \u2014 without actually saying anything \u2014 than any of us realized.\nIt\u2019s a rough ride, should you choose to take it; some of you will not be making it back. It\u2019s as if Mattos has sun-baked the hypnotic pedal abuse of Mincemeat Or Tenspeed into the huge metal apparatus of Barr\u2019s solo-guitar work, the whole concoction vaulting way over the top as repetition turns to repetition turns to repetition turns to repetition. Before you know it, Chrome Forest has you by the curly Qs. It cools you off with a blast of ice-cool steam every now and again, but for the most part, the guitar loops spiral around in the air like helicopter seeds (which one can find under sycamore leaves, if you must know) as the ear tries to catch them, never quite bringing them under control. The loops pile on and back off, echo and drift, linger and lilt. The patterns are so rigid your ears will perk up like candy-cane smiles when you hear the second and third layers form a hardened crust around your ugly head.\nAs with the family Mississippi leg hound, it\u2019s best to just let Mattos finish. Trust me, he\u2019s going somewhere with this.\" - Grant \"Gumshoe\" Purdum, Tiny Mix Tapes, 2012\nDoomsday Student (2011-present)\nDoomsday Student\nhttps://www.facebook.com/DoomsdayStudent/\nhttps://doomsdaystudent.bandcamp.com/album/a-self-help-tragedy\nArab on Radar (1994-2002, 2010)\nArab on Radar Photo by Michelle Morby\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_on_Radar\nhttps://arabonradar.bandcamp.com/\nAthletic Automaton (2003-2007)\nAthletic Automaton Live at O'Briens Pub, Allston, MA\nhttps://www.facebook.com/AthleticAutomaton/\nhttp://www.skingraftrecords.com/bandhtmlpages/athletic_automaton.html\nhttps://skingraftrecords.bandcamp.com/album/5-days-in-africa-extended\nPledges:\nUPDATE!

In the time since then I have completed two full sketchbooks. This volume will feature the best pages from those past 4 years worth of sketching!\nHere is a preview of what the cover of the book will look like:\nSketchbook Volume 02\nBook Specifics\nUnlike \"Sketch Volume 01\", this sketchbook collection will be a hard cover volume. It will feature Svepa PU material in black stretched over Mingou Greyboard with a gold foil stamped design on the cover and the spine.\nThe final book will be 6x9 portrait size and approximately 120 pages, all filled with sketches!\nTo keep the drawings accurate to their original size the format has changed since the last volume because I now work in smaller sketchbooks (easier to carry around with me everywhere I go)!\nGoing forward, I would like to publish a new volume of sketches every couple of years, and each one will be in a similar format and size so that they will match up nicely as a set in the future.\n Why A Printed Sketchbook?\nI like to think of sketchbooks as a window into the creative soul of an artist. For me, they are an indispensable part of my creative process. It is where all of my good ideas (and several of the not-so-good ones) begin and evolve. The main output of my sketches over the past 10-15 years has been for my personal world-building project: Gateway, for which I have so far developed a self-published, full-color illustrated book titled: \"Gateway: The Book of Wizards\", as well as a board/card game hybrid called \"Gateway: Uprising,\" available now in stores and online, published by CMON Games. \nA sketch of \"Gateway: Prison-City\"\nSeveral years ago, while sitting behind my first ever convention booth at IlluXcon in Altoona, PA, the great Donato Giancola (painter and illustrator extraordinaire) was looking through my sketchbook and remarked that I should make a printed version of it, so that other people could have the same experience of looking through it without having to find me at conventions and hope that I had it with me. \nSo after launching my first Kickstarter for Gateway, I decided to make \"Sean Andrew Murray: Sketchbook Volume 01\" a stretch goal, and thus the first printed sketches volume was born. \nI want anyone who picks up this book to have a peek into my creative process, and see how and where my ideas start. \n The Rewards for Pledging\nPledge Rewards for now are simple; the main one being for the book itself. I have added a couple of levels for additional items like the first two original books, and then I also have several original ink drawings that I am offering as well. \nIf the one and only stretch goal is met, then I will add on an additional pledge level for the reprint of \"Sketchbook Volume 01\".\n     INKTOBER SPECIALS\nWith each of the following rewards levels, you will receive one piece of original art, an \"Inktober\" drawing created during this month, for which I have chosen the theme of \"robots\". This campaign has started with eight of these drawings available, but as I complete more Inktober drawings I will add them as pledge levels. Each drawing is approximately 6\"x9\" either horizontal or vertical.\nThe packages range between $130 and $185 depending on the intricacy of the drawing.\nIf you wish to add the two original books onto any of these pledge levels, just add $35 to your pledge. \nIf you would like to add a signed, limited edition 13\"x19\" print of your choice, add $35 to your pledge.\n                   \"Marketown Street Scene\" Limited-Edition Print Exclusive!\n   STRETCH GOALS!\nAs I stated in the video, I want to keep things simple, so I only have one stretch goal: to reprint the first volume, \"Sketchbook Volume 01\", and bring it in line with the new look of \"Sketchbook Volume 02\", so that it will be consistent with the look of the whole set going forward!\nIf this happens, then I will add a new pledge reward level, which will allow you to get both books for $60.\n Add-Ons - New! \n- Add $5 to any pledge for a 2-hour, narrated video tutorial of \"Marketown Street Scene\" See trailer below:\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am keeping this Kickstarter simple this time around to ensure that I get everyone their books as close to the promised time as possible. I am working with a very talented designer, Andrew Nelson, and we will be working with A to Z Media, a company that Andrew has a close working relationship with, to do the printing. \n\nI balance many things in my life and career between teaching, freelance work, Gateway projects, and family life, but I am committed to making this book look great and to getting it to you as soon as humanly possible - hopefully way before the stated delivery date. \n\nI am always open to suggestions, thoughts and concerns.

We will ship them to everyone immediately upon their arrival at our Flesk warehouse in Santa Cruz, CA.\nAll items shipped within the U.S.A. are by USPS Mail and will include tracking. The items shipped to our international friends usually take 3 weeks for delivery, but can sometimes take up to 3-6 weeks depending on the country. We know that shipping overseas is very expensive and we wish it was cheaper, too! We help by subsidizing some of the cost. We make no money from the shipping.\nSample book spread from Familiars\n  JOHN'S THOUGHTS ON J.A.W. COOPER\nThe first time I saw Cooper's art was when she submitted to Spectrum: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art. This is when her art smugly entered my life, sat in front of me to show itself off, and literally caused a pause in time. I couldn't help but to absorb and enjoy her art for an undetermined (translates to very long) amount of time. This moment repeats itself every time I see a new piece of hers. She has the perfect mixture between the informed sciences and the surreal as she stretches reality into an abundance of unique views that constantly amazes. The intelligence and cleverness of her drawings are simply extraordinary.\nSample book spread from Viscera\n ABOUT J.A.W. COOPER\nJ.A.W. Cooper was born in England to a South African/British mother and an American father - both freshwater ecologists. She grew up traveling for their research and professor exchanges, living in Kenya, Sweden, Ireland and traveling across Europe. Home base was Southern California between trips, sabbaticals, and longer stays in other countries. Her mother always practiced art, in particular scientific illustration, and from an early age she was eager to learn how to perform the same kind of \"magic.\" Between my parent's dedication to ecology, our extensive traveling, and her mother's skill as an artists, Cooper was primed to be fascinated with flora and fauna and obsessed with capturing them in sketches and paintings.\nSample spread from Flora & Fauna\n  A message from the Publisher, John Fleskes: What Kickstarter offers is the opportunity to create and do what we love, while connecting and giving back to our supporters in a personal way. This makes the process much more enjoyable than if we simply worked behind closed doors. It is also gratifying to have the opportunity to continually add value to the project through stretch goals. I've never felt that we are making products. Instead, we are making unique art books and prints. This is done with great care to best allow us to showcase Cooper's art in a way that we can be proud of. We hope that you will cherish them just as much as we do.\nAll artwork is \u00a9 2017 J.A.W.

John Fleskes answers:\n\nI pride myself on having a fifteen year record of delivering over eighty books of the highest quality. I've run six previous Kickstarter campaigns, with Brom, Frank Cho, Petar Meseldzija, Richard and Wendy Pini, Mark Schultz, and Daren Bader and Lance HaunRogue. Most of these have been on time. We are very open with our backers and communicate through updates often to keep you up to date. \n\nIn some cases, things don't always go exactly as planned in the publishing world. Much of the time they do, but sometimes an unexpected problem or delay arises. In the rare case that this happens, simply put, I deal with it and find a way to get the job done. I am very open about any challenges and like to share in the process so people know what's going on. I don't like surprises, and don't feel anyone else should either. I respect the artist, and our supporters too much to let them down. The good thing is that I've published over eighty books and I know how to get them shipped and delivered, and I know how to manage a schedule and keep projects on track, and I will stay motivated and energized to get the books into your hands when I said I would.\n\nI can't thank everyone enough who has supported us before.

Cooper: Three Book Set With Prints"}}, {"backer": "Ryan Lesser", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Rising Sun is a board game for 3 to 5 players set in legendary feudal Japan (up to 6 players with the expansion). As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We are back with two new versions that most have never seen!\nThe dragon finishes in this set are real Gold, Silver, Copper, and Black Nickel. The choice is yours, but we are partial to the sweet, sweet gold in the GOLD EDITION. However, we are very excited to bring back the classic Dragoon dragon names of Ketchup, Squash, Seamonster, and Bone, now in plastic!\n  But we don't want to do JUST another print run. That would be boring! So we are launching The Rogue and Barbarian Expansion on Kickstarter! The expansion expands the core game for up to 6 players in any combination. It also adds asymmetrical gameplay, as both humans come with completely different movesets! \n\nThe game has been rigorously tested over the last year by hundreds of backers, peers, and most importantly by Jeff. THANKS JEFF! You know Jeff, right?\nWhile we don't have the plastic pieces mold made, here is a look at the models what we have in store for the expansion!\nAnd of course, you can choose between plastic or metal.

My name is Clark Huggins, and I'm an illustrator, and the creator of  RECKLESS DECK - a Science Fiction and fantasy-based, character-creating card deck. Any artist armed with a Reckless Deck can banish those creativity-stopping words \"what should I draw?\", and instead approach the blank page with a sense of fearlessness, fun, and a willingness to leap before you look.  \nReckless Deck is a character-creating card deck: 72 individual cards, divided into six categories across four genres. Basically, Reckless Deck is a randomizer, an idea generator. But it's also a genre smasher - it takes everything you think you know about the borders between Science Fiction and Fantasy, Between Steampunk and Comics and Horror - and turns it all on its head. The results are a never ending supply of fresh ammunition for your next painting, comic, or sketchbook doodle - or your next novel, short story, cosplay character, or gaming adventure, for that matter.\nI created Reckless Deck for my own use in the studio. But once I began drawing using Reckless Deck as a concept-generating tool, I started to experience the supercharged sense of freedom and imagination it can offer - and also how unique and powerful the images it can lead to can be.\nMy wife and I decided the arcane fun I was having gleefully trashing all the walls that separated Gandalf from Darth Maul was something other people might want to get in on, too. So we self-produced our first, limited run of Reckless Deck: Volume One, and began selling it via our website, Amazon.com, and in person at conventions and events. Our sales were consistently strong despite doing very little advertising (we started with 1,000 decks, and they're pretty much gone.) We got a great write-up in UK concept art magazine IMAGINE FX. Our Facebook and Instagram communities started to spring up completely on their own. Emails consistently rolled in from Canada, the UK, and beyond asking where to get the deck, and was it available at a retailer near them? Suddenly Reckless Deck was a very clear and viable thing.\n  Reckless Deck is ready for the next step. After RD: Volume 1 was already out in the world, ideas for new cards kept coming. The result was a war chest full of thrilling new cards that had the potential to take the imaginative power and scope of Reckless Deck to a whole new level. This Kickstarter is about adding those ideas to the arsenal of both existing Reckless Deck fans and newcomers alike. RECKLESS DECK: VOLUME 2 has a whole new look that takes the original design and pushes it even further into a visual world that evokes dark magic and alchemy.\nVOLUME 2 offers an all-new set of 72 individual cards in the 5 original categories, and well as a new, SIXTH category designed to send your art in surprising new directions. In it you'll find:\nA very powerful card category, INTRINSIC NATURE is about the total essence or scope of your character concept. It tends to affect the entire design as a whole, and direct your choices in an overarching, fundamental way.\n  The MODIFICATIONS category prompts you to create more localized, isolated changes to the physicality of your character, pushing them to be something beyond an ordinary human - be it thorough science, magic, mythology, or mutation.\n  The WEAPONS category is exactly what it sounds like - the firearms, blades, and other instruments of defense, damage, or wanton destruction your character wields.\n  The COSTUMES category is about the fabulous fashions of your new character. Exciting, eclectic prompts for all of your character's garments, protective gear, and fashion choices.\n  ACCESSORIES is your character's possessions and gear - stuff they carry, tools they use, or objects they might value. The ACCESSORIES category offers diverse prompts that add functional, decorative, or unique narrative details to your character ideas.\n   The REINVENTION category exists on a slightly separate functional wavelength from the other 5 categories - drawing a REINVENTION card invites you to turn the power of your Reckless Deck not inward towards a new, not-yet-realized character, but outwards, towards the wealth of characters that already exist out in the world. The cards point you in the direction of a character from popular and classic literature, film & television, comics, mythology - or possibly even your own reflection. Any given REINVENTION card will prompt you to choose your favorite hero or villain of a particular genre, and then give him or her the full RECKLESS DECK treatment. The REINVENTION category is your chance to explore the Han Solo and Chewbacca of some kind of Steampunk-mystical world, the Evil Spider-Man of the Post Apocalypse, or the female Harry Potter of some kind of bio-technical future. Or, a new, adventurous - or dangerous - version of yourself in a role you'd never imagine you'd inhabit. \n  Privateer Han Solo & Chewbacca\n    The Reckless Deck Passport includes a single copy of every and any product that we unlock!\n    Please note that Stretch Goal design work is not finalised. These design prototypes are subject to change.\n      I'd like to take a moment to give a sincere tip of the hat to David LaRocca & Heath Robinson's ELDER DICE campaign for turning us on to this box format! We've been looking for a box design we were excited about for just under a year now, with no success - thanks to ELDER DICE for this stellar find.\n      RECKLESS DECK: WORLDS opens up an entirely new avenue of idea generating devoted entirely to ENVIRONMENTS. All new categories will offer you endless combinations of worlds, lands, and civilizations for your environment art and concepting.\n  Leave the fate of the alignment of your Reckless Deck creations in the hands of Fate with this arcane Good & Evil coin.\n    This Box holds 5+ Decks of RD cards, AND, tumble down the rabbit hole with this APPRENTICE PACK Expansion for EVERY PLEDGER!\n  Get a sanity-crushing draught of H.P.

I received numerous emails from parents and kids alike, telling of the time kids were spending using Reckless Deck to create fantastical new characters and filling pages with drawings or stories about them. And I've heard from many teachers who teach from the elementary school to the college level and beyond who've said they've incorporated Reckless Deck into their class work or syllabus. With this Kickstarter, we want to make a deeper commitment to the educational potential of the deck. And so, we've found several education outreach partners to whom we will be donating at least one Reckless Deck for every backer we get.\n We are now partnered with The Association of Science Fiction & Fantasy Artists - the organization behind the prestigious Annual Chesley Awards. ASFA has an ongoing program called the Emerging Artists competition, for young artists at the high school level, held at several regional conventions across the US. An assortment of RECKLESS DECK products will now be the prize for each of the winners. www.asfa-art.org\n FREE ARTS NYC provides underserved New York City children with a unique combination of educational arts and mentoring programs that help them to foster the self-confidence and resiliency needed to realize their fullest potential. We'll be making a donation of Reckless Deck products to Free Arts NYC based on the number of decks purchased by your backers. www.freeartsnyc.org\nBeacon Charter High School for the Arts develops artistic thinkers by nurturing self-expression while preparing their graduates with the academic skills necessary for sustained postsecondary success. Reckless Deck is a Rhode Island-based company, and we wanted very much to include a school based in Rhode Island among our donation recipients.\n          This project will be employing the services of Backerkit for its survey & fulfillment needs. Which means all shipping costs for your orders will be calculated at the close of the successfully funded campaign. There are no additional shipping charges built into any of the rewards tiers. \nAs potential stretch goals unlock, they will become available as add-on items at the close of the campaign, unless otherwise specified. Backerkit will provide each backer with a survey via email a day or two following the end of the campaign, and with it the opportunity to add any unlocked items to your initial pledge. Or, you may use this table to determine the prices of the Add Ons you wish to include, and adjust your pledge ahead of time to account for them.\nThe lion's share of the design work is already done. The intention is to do one final round of design approvals after the campaign based on which stretch goals unlock and go forward to production. The final order for all fully funded items will be placed very soon after the close of the campaign. We have been told to expect about a two month turnaround time from placing the order to receiving the finished product. Depending on when precisely the order is placed, we expect fulfillment to occur mid-summer 2017.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is a design and printing undertaking, and with that, there could be unforeseen issues that come up in the production and/or shipping of our products. However, we have taken many precautions to minimize these risks. Our content is DONE, and the design process is already well under way and ahead of schedule - so design & content related snafus are already at an extreme minimum.

Smack Talk Showdown was born out of a game jam, iterated on and refined over the past year and now it's ready to share with the world! \nSmack Talk Showdown is the party game where smack talking your opponents is not only encouraged, it's necessary!  The game is all about the art of the wrestling promo. Two players assume the guise of professional wrestlers and go head-to-head for verbal supremacy while a third player dictates the action as a Producer. Everyone not competing in the current turn (which we call a Segment) is the Audience and gets to choose the victor of the round!\nThe Main Event\nWhen a round starts, each Wrestler draws one name card from each of the two Name card decks. This is their wrestling persona.\n  The Producer then draws a Segment card. This tells the Wrestlers where they are and what they are fighting about. \n  The Producer then draws three Smack cards to play on either Wrestler during their promo. Each Wrestler draws one Smack card to use in the same way. These cards dictate the action and can be played on either Wrestler during their promos.\n\n(Card art not final) \nThe Champion\nEach Wrestler has 45 seconds to cut their promo. After which, the Audience votes for the victor. If only three people are playing, the Producer decides. \nWill you reign supreme as the Sultan of Smack?\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe currently have all the cards written and a prototype deck in hand. Now, we need your help funding the game to get it in production!\n\n\nWhat You'll Get\nSmack Talk Showdown will come with 100 unique Name cards, 50 unique Segment cards, and 350 unique Smack cards.\nSTRETCH GOAL - if we are able to hit $17,500, we will add an additional 50 cards to the 500 card base set.  25 original content cards, and 25 cards for you to fill in with your ideas!\nBecause of the time it takes to print the cards and have them shipped to us before fulfillment, any backer tier gets a PDF of all the cards to print for themselves as soon as the funding is met.\nIf you back us at the $20 level or above, not only will you receive the physical cards in a retail box, you'll receive 10 Kickstarter exclusive cards!\nBelow are a sample of the Kickstarter exclusive cards\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe card design and content will be finalized and locked before the end of the campaign. If funded, we will immediately set out to publish the game. We have lined up a printer, and are working right now to nail down the logistics of shipping and fulfillment. \nWe will do everything in our power to get this game into your hands sometime in December of 2017.

So on Inauguration Day, We the People will flood Washington, DC with NEW symbols of hope.\nThis art has been already been commissioned by the Amplifier Foundation. Some of the greatest activist artists working today, including Shepard, Ernesto Yerena, and Jessica Sabogal, have collaborated with photographers to create a series of images that capture the shared humanity of our diverse America.\nNow the tricky part: printing and distributing these images on a massive scale in time for Inauguration. \nMuch of Washington will be locked down on Inauguration Day, and in some areas there will be severe restrictions on signs and banners.  But we've figured out a hack.  It's called the newspaper!  On January 20th, if this campaign succeeds, we're going to take out full-page ads in the Washington Post with these images, so that people across the capitol and across the country will be able to carry them into the streets, hang them in windows, or paste them on walls.\nEvery dollar you put into this campaign will buy six ads printed and distributed for us.\nAmplifier will also distribute these images as large placards throughout DC at Metro stops, out the back of moving vans, at drop spots to be announced in the coming week via our social media feeds, and, on January 19, as free downloads for you to print and share as you like.\nAnd for every donation over $5 we will even send a postcard of the art of your choosing to the incoming President after he takes office! (Stay tuned for the text we will use!)  \nThis art is meant to spark a conversation, and after January 20, our work will continue. What does WE THE PEOPLE\u2014these three famous words in the preamble to the Constitution\u2014mean in the 21st century? Over the next several months, Amplifier will partner with organizations, schools, and everyday families to create spaces across the county, in both red states and blue, where we can speak, listen, and share our answers. Watch for updates on this as the campaign funds and moves into the world!\nWHO ARE WE?\nSHEPARD FAIREY is one of the most accomplished street artists in the world, and creator and founder of Obey Clothing and Obey Giant, first becoming known for his \"Andre The Giant has a Posse\" sticker campaign while at the Rhode Island School of Design. He became widely known during the 2008 presidential election for his Barak Obama \"Hope\" poster. \nJESSICA SABOGAL is a first generation Colombian American muralist. Her art serves as a haven, a tribute, a creative outlet of adoration and exaltation for women with stories often untold. Her pieces possess a vision of female identity that is revolutionary and powerful, brave and beautiful. Most recently she has created a visual campaign entitled, \u201cWomen Are Perfect\u201d which attempts to spread this simple but necessary notion worldwide.\nERNESTO YERENA is an artist living in Los Angeles.  His art brings political concerns to light with subject matter that depicts cultural icons, rebels and everyday people voicing their stance against oppression. While Yerena identifies as Chicano he also strongly identifies as Native/Indigenous to this continent which is often seen in his work. Highly recognized for his activism, Yerena is the founder and curator of the Alto Arizona Art campaign (2010) as well as a founding member of the We Are Human campaign (2009).\nTHE AMPLIFIER FOUNDATION:  Our non-profit is dedicated to amplifying the voices of grassroots movements through art and community engagement. We do this by funding collaborations between those movements and contemporary artists so that their messages can reach a wider audience. Our goal is to flip artists into activists and observers into participants.  \nOur work has supported Criminal Justice Reform projects with Cut50.org, Environmental campaigns working with Indigenous groups against the KXL pipeline and in defense of Treaty Rights in the Black Hills, and we have, just this week, commissioned, and started printing and distributing the majority of the art for the Women's March on Washington as an official partner.  \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe are here to find partners as much as funding.  When this message is heard we want them to know it comes direct from the people.  Our goal is 10,000 backers in this Kickstarter and ten times that many participants after Inauguration day. \nTHE REWARDS:\n STAY TUNED FOR PHASE 2!\n___________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo matter what, we have the ability to get tens of thousands of pieces of this art printed to distribute for free in public. We also have guarantees from the silkscreen and offset printers that our product can be made in a timely manner. There is a very, very small chance the Washington Post could reject our ad at the last minute, though we have been talking to their ad department for some time and they know what we are running. If that were to happen, we would buy ad space in other DC papers that day, and we would continue to spread the art beyond Inauguration Day via billboards, bus-shelter ads, etc.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nCREDITS \n\n/ PHOTOGRAPHERS /\nDelphine Diallo: www.delphinediallo.com\nRidwan Adhami: www.ridwanadhami.com\nArlene Mejorado: www.amejorado.com\nAyse Gursoz: www.aysegursoz.com\n\n/ ARTISTS /\nShepard Fairey: www.obeygiant.com\nErnesto Yerena: www.hechoconganas.com \nJessica Sabogal: www.jessicasabogal.com\n\nFILM\n\n/ SOUNDTRACK /\n\u201cRock The Nation\u201d by LA Symphony \n\u201cThe War\u201d by The Procussions\nSoundmix by Split Rock Studios: jasonsarubbi.com \n\n/ CINEMATOGRAPHY /\nEric Becker: www.weareshouting.com\nMax Basch: www.maxwellbasch.com\nMike Lawrence\nMelinda James: www.aboutherfilms.com\nAdrien Oneiga: www.oneiga.com\nLenny Mesina: www.therapystudios.com/editors/lenny-mesina\n\n\n/ Produced / Edited / Directed by May Day / www.maydaycreative.org /\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard to the President", "descp": "We will send a postcard hand signed with your name to the president with the art of your choosing.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["498 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "We The People Sticker Pack", "descp": "Five stickers from the \"We the People\" series, one from each of the 5 art pieces.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card to the President", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,756 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Amplifier Sticker Super Pack", "descp": "Super pack of stickers which include 20 mixed Amplifier Stickers from a selection of renowned international artists including Shepard Fairey, Ernesto Yerena, Chip Thomas, Josh MacPhee, Roger Peet, Gregg Deal, Jessica Sabogal and more!

My name is Clark Huggins, and I'm an illustrator. I do science fiction, fantasy, and comics art. I've created a card deck that helps artists & creatives attack that blank page and turn it from their worst enemy to a nice, white place where freaking amazingly cool stuff happens. \n   RECKLESS DECK is a character-creating card deck - 72 individual cards, divided into five different categories. At its heart, Reckless Deck is a randomizer, an idea generator. But what it effectively does is take everything you think you know about our most loved genres of fantasy fiction, games, and movies - the Space Epic, the Haunted House, the Steampunk Adventure - and turns it all on its head. Reckless Deck is a genre smasher - it audaciously mashes up the swords and wizards of fantasy with the technology of sci fi, the caped crusaders of comics, and the cogs and brass of Steampunk. The results are a never-ending supply of fresh creative ammunition for your next painting, comic, sketchbook doodle - or even your next novel, short story, cosplay character, or gaming adventure. \nDon't ever stare at that blank page one second more than you have to again. \nBy Ken McCuen\n                                          I created Reckless Deck for my own personal use in the studio. But once I shuffled those cards and started to experience first hand how familiar objects and tropes, once separated from the comfortable backdrop of their genre, could respond like dangerous, forbidden alchemical elements - and ignite stunning, unexpected creative possibilities.\nMy wife and I decided that the arcane fun I was having gleefully trashing all the walls that separated Gandalf from Obi Wan Kenobi was something other people might want to get in on, too. So, we self-produced our first, limited run of RECKLESS DECK: VOLUME ONE eighteen months ago, selling it via our website, Amazon, and in person at conventions and events. The results were nothing short of stellar. They continue to sell extremely well despite very little resources thrown to advertising (We started with 1,000 decks, and they're pretty much gone.) We got a great writeup in the celebrated UK fantasy art magazine IMAGINE FX. Our Facebook and Instagram communities started to spring up completely on their own. Emails consistently rolled in from Canada, the UK, and even further abroad asking where to get the deck, and was it available at a retailer near them? Suddenly RECKLESS DECK was a very clear and verifiable thing.\nby M. Wayne Miller\n  RECKLESS DECK is ready for the next level. In preparation, We\u2019ve been stockpiling fantastic, mind-bending new content for the new editions we\u2019re preparing to release. We wanted to greatly expand your RECKLESS DECK options - which is what brings us here, to Kickstarter. With your help, we want to produce not one, but TWO new decks - and then some.\nFirst, RECKLESS DECK: VOLUME TWO. Whether it\u2019s used alone, or combined with Volume One, the all-new Volume Two will be 72 all-new cards of the genre smashing our fans have come to know and expect - but, with even deeper cuts of mind blowing imagery from every corner of Fantasy and Sci Fi. It has all new updated designs - and, there\u2019s a sixth new card category that fundamentally changes how you use RECKLESS DECK: basically, now you can point it OUTWARDS at anything that's already out there - even yourself.\n  Second, we learned something we didn't expect from Volume 1: that KIDS were huge fans of RECKLESS DECK. And not just kids who already liked to draw, but kids who were willing to start drawing just to see the cool stuff come to life. Which is why we're creating a RECKLESS DECK that's just for kids: RECKLESS DECK: THE APPRENTICE PACK.\n It'll have it's own kid-inspired design, and be full of the same kind of content that they see in kid-and-YA-inspired movies and literature. And, because we believe so strongly that the RECKLESS DECK for kids is going to be something that will fire young, creative minds, we are fully committed to donating one kids' deck to a Youth Arts Organization for every single pledge we receive. So far, we are partnered with Free Arts NYC (www.freeartsnyc.org) who say they service enough underprivileged children to be able to put even a large scale donation to immediate use. \nWe're also very excited to announce that we've just arranged a partnership with The Association of Science Fiction & Fantasy Artists (http://asfa-art.org) - the organization behind the Chelsey Awards! They have begun an Emerging Artist Award Program for kids in elementary school through college, to be given at regional conventions nationwide. Reckless Deck will now be donating both the VOLUME 1deck and the upcoming  products from this Kickstarter as their official prizes!\n  The next phase in RECKLESS DECK\u2019S evolution is going to be an ongoing series of genre-specific Booster Pack Expansions. Colleagues have been suggestions this to me for awhile, and I would reply, \u201cBut RECKLESS DECK is about breaking out of genres!\" But, I've seen the light, and we've found the the answer to this in our new, ongoing series of RECKLESS DECK BOOSTER/EXPANSION PACKS. These genre-specific, 20-card Boosters will focus in on one particular slice of a genre, offering a concentrated hit of the stuff that appeals to you specifically. This marks a huge turning point in how Reckless Deck can be used. With the Boosters, you\u2019re no longer bound by what comes in Volume One or Volume Two. You can endlessly customize your deck, shaping it to conform to what ignites your creativity the most. You can work from an ever-growing Mechagodzilla-sized well of RECKLESS DECK resources - or curate a compact, powerful deck that's custom-built just for you. \nOur first Booster Pack will be a Kickstarter EXCLUSIVE, meaning, this will be your only chance to get it! And with it, we\u2019re taking a bold step into uncharted territory - literally, as it turns out, as the first Booster Pack is RECKLESS DECK: ENVIRONMENTS! Step beyond your character and explore the world around him or her (or it) - from what\u2019s in the room, to what\u2019s in the world! The Kickstarter will also be offering its very first \u201cOfficial\u201d Booster, RECKLESS DECK: POST APOCALYPSE! 20 cards of \u201cafter-the-s**t-hits-the-fan\u201d craziness to supercharge your art, your stories, or your gaming adventures.\nMany more Booster Packs are in the queue to be released as stretch goals. When we hit a certain funding goal, a PAIR of new booster packs will be announced and released! All unlocked Boosters will be released all at once to Kickstarter Backers - but WILL NOT be released on the market that way! That means, if you miss out on a Booster through this Kickstarter, you may have a long wait before you see it again.\nby Kirbi Fagan\n     by Uriah Voth\n                                        We have an awesome list of stretch goals waiting to be unlocked as we clear the hurdle of initial funding and continue to hit further milestones. Some are still a secret - and which of the Expansion Packs are getting released when will most definitely stay a mystery until that funding goal is reached! But for now, here's a taste of what's to come...\n          For all domestic orders, shipping is INCLUDED in the price of the rewards tier. For all international orders, shipping rates will be calculated by BACKERKIT at the close of the campaign. This will ensure accurate shipping rates for your particular corner of the globe, and for the weight of the items you've chosen. Also, ADD ONS of individual decks, booster packs, and other unlocked stretch goal items will be available once the campaign in over. Additional shipping for additional add ons will be calculated separately per item at the end of the campaign. All shIpping will be through USPS.\nby Clark Huggins\n  Click to read.\n                                     A word about the budget: this is not a Kickstarter about taking a thing from the ether and bringing it to life. We did that already, with the first small run of Reckless Deck 18 months ago. This is about taking that proven, road-tested thing and growing it exponentially, from a single deck into an interconenctive product line. Our costs reflect our attempts to bring not one but three different card decks into the marketplace, a well as a whole new ongoing series of expansion packs.\nReckless Deck created by Clark Huggins  \nAll designs by Nerses Malakjan  \nOriginal Reckless Deck design by Keith Coney\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is a design and printing undertaking, and with that, there could be unforeseen issues that come up in the production and/or shipping of our products.

For the past year and a half, I've lived a double life - commercial illustrator by day, independent card artist by night. In the spare hours between working on other people's ideas, I've been bringing my own creation to life: a playing card deck set in a dark fantasy world and populated by a cast of strange and complex characters.\nWicked Kingdom is my first large-scale personal project - it's a step away from my usual commercial art, and a chance to create a body of work more in line with my own vision.\n  Printed by the USPCC on casino-quality Bee card stock, Wicked Kingdom is an art-rich 54-card poker deck, featuring dual-identity face cards with a narrative twist and obsessively detailed, hand-painted artwork throughout. \nHand-drawn pips, elegantly watermarked number cards, and unique not-quite-two-way backs add to the intensely illustrated flavor of the deck.\n(Working card layout - deck design may change to reflect feedback)\n    [ The Wicked Kingdom art book... ]\nWicked Kingdom is more than just another deck of pretty pictures (although it has those too, in spades). Each face card has a personality, a backstory... and a hidden agenda. With every card, the plot thickens... \nThe artwork and backstories for each card are featured in the art book, alongside process write-ups, work-in-progress snapshots, and notes from the creation of the traditionally painted images.\n    Want to help make this deck a reality? Click \"back this project\" on the right, and select a reward tier.\nIf you want to purchase extras or mix and match items from more than one tier, just select a single reward tier for your base pledge, then click \"Manage My Pledge\" and increase the dollar amount of your pledge to cover the additional items (you can find a menu of add-on items and prices below.) After the campaign ends, you'll be sent an email survey to collect information on your add-on choices. \n      Everything in the Wicked Kingdom deck is hand-drawn and hand-painted - the original drawings and paintings (along with limited-edition giclee prints of the card art) are available for purchase.\nLimited edition print sets are listed below. You can find larger images of the available images (and purchase single prints) in the Wicked Kingdom shop.\nOriginal drawings are listed below. You can find larger images of the available drawings in the Wicked Kingdom shop.\nOriginal paintings are listed below. You can find larger images of the available paintings in the Wicked Kingdom shop.\n  $40,000  (UNLOCKED!) - BEE STOCK UPGRADE FOR ALL DECKS \nBee stock is USPCC's premium, casino-quality card stock; it's thicker, more durable, and just generally nicer than the standard card stock. Bee stock is included in each and every deck at no additional cost now that we've hit $40,000.\n$50,000 (UNLOCKED!) - HIDDEN STRETCH GOAL: ART BOOK REWARD TIER\nNow that we've reached the 50k mark, the hand painted artwork has finally earned itself a showcase outside the confines of the card deck!\nThe art book will be a 72 page softcover (6.625 x 10.25\") volume featuring all of the art and writing from the Wicked Kingdom project, along with process write-ups, work-in-progress snapshots, and notes on the creation of the traditionally-painted artwork for the deck.\n$60,000 (UNLOCKED!) - CUSTOM SEALS FOR ALL DECKS\nA seal, for the uninitiated, is that little sticker that holds a brand new card deck closed. Normally it's a plain black sticker with a spade and USPCC brand name printed on it. If we can hit $60,000, the Wicked Kingdom Deck will get a custom-printed seal... hopefully something so breathtakingly beautiful that you'll feel a serious sense of loss when you have to cut it open to get to your cards.

While there's always the possibility of unexpected setbacks, I've put a great deal of planning into this project to ensure everything goes smoothly.

The core of it is an illustration series that I've been working on for over twelve years. This is the second book in the series and is the largest collection of work from the project to date.\nThis is a story of the angelic order known as the Watchers that came down to earth to teach mankind. Despite their good intentions, they brought a down a catastrophe that completely destroyed their lineage. I've built upon the scraps of myth that surround these fallen angels to create original stories and illustrations that illuminate their epic tragedy.\nThe final book will be at least 92 pages worth of art, short stories and poems making it at least twice the content of the first book. It will be printed with a 9\"x12\" hard bound cover and dust jacket so that makes a matching set with Angelarium: Book of Emanations.\n  The central figures of this book are the Chiefs of Tens. They are the twenty most powerful members of the angelic host and lead the hundreds of Watchers who've made their new home on earth. Each one is corrupted in their own way and through their downfall, they come to embody the opposite of what once made them great. You can see illustrations for all twenty of them on the official website here along with the rest of the project: www.angelarium.net\nThere will also be a number of Seraphim in the book as well\nArtwork from Goni Montes\n   In addition to the book, I've created a number of complimentary items for fans that want something extra but also because I really enjoy making them. The sktchbooks, cards and coins exist because I love those sorts of things, so I created them to share with you.\nSketchbook - See the thoughts behind the work. This comprehensive companion book contains a complete collection of process drawings from the Book of Watchers.\nChallenge Coin - This totem for the project is a Kickstarter exclusive. Solid metal with embossed designs by Eli Minaya.\n Collectible Cards - An expansion of the first set released last year, this pack includes the names and writing from all 20 watchers in additional to alternate art for several angels.\n8\" x 10\" Prints - Many of the these packages include affordable luster prints done to the same loving quality is their larger counterparts.\n    Many of the most popular Watchers prints are sold out online. However, I am making my prints of them available as part of this print portfolio. All twenty 12\"x18\" Watcher prints are included, signed and delivered inside a custom gold and black portfolio.\n   There are 12\"x18\" prints of the Seraphim and Emanations are just like the ones I sell at conventions. Everyone who backs this campaign will have access to the opportunity to purchase these prints online for a limited time. This is one of the only times I will ever make these available outside of an in-person appearance.\nConventions prints will be sold through a secret part of the Angelarium store that will be linked to from a private update just for backers. There is no need to include additional funds as part of the campaign in order get them and they will be shipping far in advance of the rewards associated with the book.\nLimited Edition Prints\nbrowse available prints on the Angelarium store\n  There are no Limited Edition prints on offer through this campaign because they are actively for sale on the Angelarium.net store. They usually take between 1-5 business days to ship from my studio.\nAddons \n If you would like to combine tiers or purchase multiple copies of a tier, you may increase your pledge to cover the total amount of them added together. After the campaign ends, we will reach out to anyone with extra funds pledged to survey them about what additional rewards they are interested in. If you are interested in the first book in the series the complete Book of Emanations collection is currently available on Angelarium.net and usually ships within 1-3 business days.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe most complicated reward packages took nearly a full year to arrive to their backers last campaign. That's never the plan but sometimes unforeseen delays creep in. As delays unfold, I promise to keep backers informed as to their cause and what the revised schedule looks like. One of the team members or I will be addressing customer service issues throughout the process.\n\nWhile it's possible that the books themselves will see delays of weeks or months beyond the estimated delivery date, most of the other items from the collection are comparatively easy for me to produce and shouldn't contribute to any additional delays. My hope is that the experiences from the first book will yield an increased delivery time across the board. \n\nIt must be noted that many of the delays that I've experienced with other campaigns involve blizzards, flooding, Chinese holidays, convention schedules and other events outside my control. If everything goes completely without incident, I would be surprised.

Two to five players each control their own squad of survivors equipped to the teeth with weapons, food, and items.\n2 - 5 player co-operative post-apocalyptic zombie survival experience. (Now with an additional player!) \nSquad based system - each player controls up to four survivors (New squad board with individual survivor hit point tracking)\nEasy to master combat system, and game master-less zombie activation \nTower defense element of defending your suburban base from onslaughts of zombies - 10 grey, 20 green and 6 special zombie miniatures!\nNew phases to strategically use resources and survivors via the daily planning board. Each player assigns daily tasks to the survivors they control. Tasks include: scavenging, fortifying & building base upgrades, guard & patrol duties and lastly a new mechanic for resting and feeding your survivors. \nStory driven scavenging with a choose-your-own-adventure feel. (Adds skill challenges, bartering while scavenging and a more dynamic story tree.) \nNew skill system: We are introducing first aid, mechanics, stealth, and talk to the existing firearms and melee skills. All six skills are tracked via your survivors and using cards. These skills can be used in both the daily planning board, and combat.\nReturning to the Zpocalypse universe we are coming back to our roots as a company. As such, we want this campaign to be not just a pre-order. Instead, we want our backers, who have supported us in our endeavors, to be a part of the crowdfunding experience and have a say on parts of the game. Just like in Zpocalypse we will have aspects of the game where you can have a say how it turns out with polls and open community feedback!\nWhat is the original Zpocalypse game?\nZpocalypse is a cooperative play, zombie survival game in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Two to four players play squads of survivors, managing their stats on a squad board. To be the best team spend one to four days in the nuclear zombified wasteland. Start in a basement/fallout shelter that leads to several base locations, or even through the sewers. Scavenge for food and supplies, which expands the transformable board. Feed your survivors and add their skills to your squad board, then use your squad to fortify your base. An event card adds additional challenges and gives zombie movement. Combat adds the adrenaline rush of moving around the board trying to combat zombies before they consume you. Every fortification built, zombie killed, and survivor saved leads to victory points which determines the ultimate winner, and also allows you to level up in weapons ability. Try to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the undead.\nMost Zpocalypse components will be compatible with Zpocalypse 2: Defend the \u2018Burbs. Scroll down to \"Changes to the Zpocalypse\" to read more about compatibility.\n\u201cWhen the city was overcome, we thought, \u2018This is the end.\u2019 Then they bombed us, and we were sure it was over. Somehow- I don\u2019t know how, or why, but somehow we survived the onslaught. There were only a few of us, but we escaped the pit of hell that was the urban wasteland. They always say the suburbs have it better, right? They weren\u2019t hit nearly as hard; we\u2019ve found a sturdy house. It still has a roof and everything. We're hungry, tired, and it's a struggle to hold back the dead from their nightly assaults, but we\u2019re still here, we\u2019re not going down yet.\u201d\nYou fled the city for the suburbs. It sounded like a good plan, but you\u2019re still fighting for survival! What makes this new rendition unique is that we\u2019ve enhanced several parts of the game. Your actions as squad leader allow the survivors to choose their tasks on the daily action board. Each choice has limited space, and will come with benefits (potential for more supplies) and costs (like all things in the Zpocalypse, it\u2019s never pleasant). With gained experience your survivors will level up on a variety of skills to choose from. Rather than picking your path for you, now you have the ability to carve out your survival scenario for yourself, but be careful what you wish for.\nCampaign-lite Play\nWe created the original Zpocalypse to have a game play that reflected a chaotic and messy world. You\u2019ve managed to survive the initial blasts of dropped nukes, only to fight zombies the moment you leave the bunker. In Defend the \u2018Burbs, forced combat is toned down, with a larger emphasis on upgrading your base, allocating your survivors daily tasks, and generally seeing how many days you can survive based on your decisions instead of chance. Defend the \u2018Burbs will also be the first edition to introduce a campaign style play mode. If you already own the original Zpocalypse, Zmergency, or Aftermath, they combine so players can go back and forth between the urban wasteland and the new suburban biome for as many game days as you can survive.\nScenarios\nThe main scenario for Zpocalypse 2: Defend the 'Burbs is to repair the truck in order to visit other locations. Like always, there are still multiple scenarios to choose from. Plus, for our fans, we have kept the original main scenario to survive over a certain amount of days.\n For a full listing of components in Zpocalypse 2: Defend the 'Burbs see the image below. *NOTE* Some components will change/increase as the campaign progresses and we unlock stretch goals, so check back often to see everything you will be getting!\nZpocalypse 2: Defend the 'Burbs comes with a total of 46 miniatures. While we had a good time with our original survivor minis (you may hear what happened to them) the 2 new survivor concepts will replace the current 10 survivors pictured. This way each squad is represented by an everyman and everywoman. As we unlock stretch goals new sculpts will become available. The miniatures are a hard PVC plastic that we've used in our, Zpocalypse Aftermath, Yashima, Fairytale Games: Miniatures campaign and Dragon Tides. The size of the miniatures will be about 25mm-30mm.\nTo see the quality of our miniatures we have also included a render from our Folklore: The Affliction project.\nOne of the biggest changes in Zpocalypse 2: Defend the 'Burbs is the daily planning board. In the original game there were set phases: scavenge, feed & fortify, something\u2019s happening, and combat. Now use your survivors as resources to allocate to the task of your choosing. Let\u2019s say you have two survivors; one can scavenge for supplies while the other upgrades base improvements. Or instead you might determine one survivor is on night patrol while the other rests. Each player takes a turn placing a single survivor on a task until all survivors have been allocated. This means players have the ability to split up their squad among different tasks as they are available. Some tasks can be upgraded and allow for more survivors. The medic station only has so many beds. You could choose to upgrade this area and build another bed unlocking another open spot for a hurt survivor. Your choices shape the base you create, and your actions determine the amount of zombies you attract.\nThere are no longer nukes exploding, so hooray for no longer calling the bunker \u201chome\u201d. You\u2019ve left the city and have ventured into the suburbs to find a house to defend. It\u2019s a bigger base with two floors. Each floor is a 8x8 inch tile, the same size as the 4 tile squares that made up the bases in Zpocalypse. The floor tiles will be double sided for variety. Due to the fact that the floors are not attached, we have the ability to create print and plays with new maps in the future.\nScavenging has leveled up in Defend the \u2018Burbs! Your encounter will vary with number of survivors, their skills, and the location. With a whole matrix of encounters you may find yourself out of luck because feral dogs heard you sneaking into the pet shop for their treats. Then again, you might make the saving game play because you remembered how to hotwire a truck (despite your mom\u2019s warnings of misspent youth) and have just enough gas to mow down a horde of zeds before heading into the toy store. If any of your scavenging team members is a smooth talker, you might bring more survivors home.\nWith our choose-your-own adventure style scavenging system there are a multitude of outcomes. We also look forward to releasing additional print and play scavenging opportunities for continued variety!\nIt is amazing what a survivor can do when they are not trying to make it past the first night. With all that newfound freedom your survivors have added to their crafting skills. In addition to the original fortifications, survivors are able to craft weapons, create base improvements and upgrade items. \nResting and Healing\nIn the original Zpocalypse you fought each night and healed back to full each morning. Zpocalypse 2 introduces a new concept known as fatigue. Fatigued survivors are limited to a single action during combat instead of the normal 2. You remove fatigue by either resting, or eating food.\nEach day, you need to choose, who rests and who does work. Resting means you don\u2019t attract as many zombies to your safe house that day, but it also means you don\u2019t find as many resources or fix up your house as quickly as you\u2019d like to.\nAs part of the daily planning board, you may allocate survivors to rest in one of three ways.  \nBed rest (requires a bed upgrade) heals you to full and doesn't attract any zombies.  \nInfirmary rest (requires infirmary upgrade) heals you to full and removes a status affect (rad or bio sickness).  \nIdle rest (requires no upgrades, you sit on the floor basically) heals 2HP, but attracts one zombie due to the survivor getting restless and making noise from time to time.\nWe have updated our squad boards for better organization and enhanced gameplay. The smaller size allows for more table space to organize your play area. Each survivor has a slot on the board to keep track of their health and the weapons they hold. Keeping track of damage means determining which of your survivors make it\u2026 or don\u2019t actually survive.\n\nComponents (mini\u2019s, tiles, chits, most cards) are compatible, but game play has been altered by new concepts of play, centered around the ability to play beyond the predefined 4 days of survival.\nSkill cards: Replace daily goals as new ability acquisition.\nScenarios: We have moved scenarios to the rulebook instead of cards to allow for more detailed information and easier release of additional scenarios in the future. \nFood and item cards: Now reduced in size to allow larger decks with more variety. Play with the new item and food decks in classic Zpocalypse by replacing the original decks. \nReduced size squad boards: To facilitate a 5th player, we reduced the size of the squad board by dropping the double HP/defense wheel. Instead you track survivor HP individually. Defense is still cumulative. Smarts and movement still work on smartest and slowest, but we feel dedicating a wheel for them is a waste of table space. \nHelper text: Moved to journal like helper sheets so that each player has a quick reference for the most important information.\nSurvivor cards new skill icons: Original survivors will be forwards and backwards compatible for either game. Original survivors are more combat focused, whereas Zpocalypse 2 survivors are more skill focused. Both may acquire and use the new skill cards. \nSomething's Happening cards: Where the original Something's Happening cards only determined the difficulty of the zombies and their movement speed based on the day, now when a Something\u2019s Happening card is turned, the fate of the players is determined by the number of zombies on the tracker. If you were terrible scavengers, had no one on patrol, and made a lot of noise building, chances are zombies have reached a critical mass and will send a horde your way. Combat is not a foregone conclusion. However, other challenges can still be sent your way such as raiders in the night! .\nAdd-on Descriptions\nZpocalypse 2: Defend the Burbs - Get an additional copy of Zpocalypse 2!\nZmergency - Zmergency introduces the new Encounter Deck to go along with the Hospital and FEMA camp tiles.

One of the biggest things is how variable the cost of shipping can be. As such, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, according to the actual costs incurred to ship to your area. We will do this through our own Pledge Manager system after the campaign concludes. \n\n*NOTE* Some higher level rewards include FREE WORLDWIDE shipping. Please see reward descriptions or pledge level graphics for details. Free worldwide shipping only applies to the rewards listed for that pledge level. If you wish to purchase additional copies or add-ons, these may incur additional shipping charges.\n\nThere are two reasons we are doing this. First, it allows us to provide a lower rate on the actual pledge levels and structure a much tighter budget for the campaign and stretch goals since we do not have to estimate for shipping costs. Second, the funds raised for the project are 100% for the actual project itself rather than being partially inflated by shipping costs that may not be accurate.  \n\nWe will be shipping through our various distribution areas. Depending on where you live, we will ship to you through our USA, Europe, Canada, or Australian centers.\n\n\nThough the pricing may vary due to any add-ons you pledge for by the end of the campaign, for the base game with an estimated box weight of 4.46 lbs. (2.02 kg) we are anticipating an average shipping fee to be about:  \n$7-$14 to ship in the USA  \n$10-$20 in Canada  \n$15-30 in the EU and Australia / New Zealand  \n$45+ to ship everywhere else  \nPlease note these are estimates and they may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we unlock, final box size and weight and also the current postal prices at the time of shipping\n\n  Money-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don\u2019t like Zpocalypse 2 Defend the \u2018Burbs within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a refund (see FAQ for details). \nEarly-Adopter Discount: Every copy of Zpocalypse 2: Defending the \u2018Burbs comes at more than a 15% discount off planned MSRP ($60-$80) as an appreciation of your early support. On top of this as we unlock stretch goals the planned MSRP may increase giving you an even better value! \nLimited and Exclusive Content: We will only print a limited number of certain rewards based on the final pledge totals. Some rewards will only be available for purchase through this Kickstarter or at conventions. This is your chance to get them at while they last! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators\u2014we really value your input, and we promptly and transparently address all questions and concerns. Have an idea for a cool stretch goal or an awesome mechanic that would be perfect for the game? Tell us and it might get added! \nBecause We Need You: We\u2019ve covered the cost of graphic design and game design for Zpocalypse 2: Defend the \u2018Burbs, but we can\u2019t manufacture and ship the game without your support. We are still very much a small indie company and need your support! You, the backers, are the people who make our games possible.\nWe are all lifelong gamers in one form or another who have been leading dual lives. By day working normal jobs, by night (and on weekends) building games whether physical or digital. In our spare time, we have formed a successful board game development and publishing company. We are so excited to be returning to Zpocalypse. It really does feel like coming home.\nPress Page: http://press.greenbriergames.com/sheet.php?p=project_zpocalypse2\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Greenbriergames \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GreenBrierGames \nWebsite: www.greenbriergames.com\nKicking It Forward: http://kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our eighth tabletop game Kickstarter project. Our first project started with cardboard and ended up with custom miniatures, cards, dice and expansion packs. From our past projects we've learned the ins and outs of nearly every facet of the board game manufacturing world. We've learned (painfully!) how to set realistic goals for both ourselves and our backers, hopefully making the process rewarding for everyone involved.\n\nAs with any project produced overseas, there can be unforeseen production delays, shipping delays, and customs delays. So we've learned (again painfully!) all about delays and ways to manage or avoid them. We know that some delays can\u2019t be predicted or avoided, so we plan extra room in our schedule. This way we can give you the best estimate for the day we can get our game into your hands- because we want to ship our products as much as you want to receive them!\n\nOf course, we've also learned to be realistic in the extra time needed for any extra content that may be added with our stretch goals. Any extra time we spend will be devoted to putting on the polish to make our game the best product it can be!\n\nSo, though there are potential delays in a manufacturing project like this, we are confident, with the experience from our last seven successful projects and our close relationship with our manufacturer, we will meet (or beat) our projected delivery date.\n \nThank you so much for your help making our dreams a reality!\n\n~ The Greenbrier Games Team\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Fall of the Spire is on Kickstarter!", "update_content": " Greetings !\nWe are so excited to let you know (in case you hadn\u2019t heard already) that the next phase of Folklore is now on Kickstarter!

Everyone draws off the same shuffled deck of cards in the center of play, called the junkpile. Players are the Scavenger Imps looking for valuable pieces of discarded garbage from both our world and the Imp Lands that bestow prestige by their mere possession.\nOn your turn you draw a card, put a piece of junk into play from your hand, and then use one of the abilities on any of your cards in play.\nAll junk is worth something and the objective of JunKing is to amass the best hoard of junk.  In the Junkpile, there is one card that is the most coveted item called \"The Crown\".  Once a player draws that card, the game is over and everyone adds up the points displayed on the pieces of junk they have found or hoarded. The player with the most points wins the current round/game.  The game only takes about 15 minutes to play, and is designed for multiple rounds of games, in much the same way you would play other fast paced games.\nI designed JunKing with these three principles in mind:\nSimple Game Mechanics\nShort Gameplay\nStrong Strategic Elements\nWhat this has resulted in is a game I can play with my two young daughters, teaching them about strategy as they read the cards and understand their interplay.  JunKing is also a game that I can bring out at the office to play with my veteran gamer friends, creating a strategic showdown late in the game as we're jockeying for position to draw The Crown.\nNote that Justin went all out on this project and has drawn unique art for every Junk Item in the deck.\nWe recently announced that we have added a FREE addition to the Mini-Expansion: 5-6 player cards and rules!

The variety and frequency of the cards in the Junkpile bring strategy to the game, much like many other strategy games.\nWe've already hit the $14,000 Stretch Goal, adding the Whu, Chu, and Thu characters to the Mini-Expansion.  Check out the Update HERE for more information.\nWe also hit the $16,000 Stretch Goal, adding 5 new types of Event cards into the Mini-Expansion.  Check out the Update HERE for more information.\nHitting the $18,000 Stretch Goal enabled us to add 24(!) new Junk items into the Mini-Expansion!  Check out the Update HERE for more information.\nWe've added 6 new characters to the Mini-Expansion due to the $20,000 Stretch Goal!  Check out the Update HERE for more information.\nHitting $22,000 Adds two variant crowns to the Mini-Expansion. Check out the Update HERE for more information.\nWe hit $24,000, enabling us to add a Linen Finish to all cards in JunKing.\nSince we passed $26,000, we will add a Box Sleeve to the Base game for no reason at all, other than to just look cool.  Which it will.\nWe hit $28,000 and will add a collector's coin to all pledges of $25 or more.  The coin can be used as a first player coin which would move from round to round. \nLike Junk Spirit Games on Facebook to hit this Stretch Goal!\nFor this Bonus goal, head to Junk Spirit Games HERE and 'Like' the page on Facebook.

Shipping will be $16.95 and we are paying the VAT cost.\nAnywhere else - Shipping from the US West Coast by USPS at a cost of $19.95.\n**Note about Add-ons and additional copies of JunKing or other pledge levels: All the Add-Ons and Prints are created in Washington State in USA and will ship from there as well. This will increase shipping costs obviously but we will work to reduce the cost to you as much as possible. Additional copies of JunKing will be consolidated into one shipping box so you will save on shipping no matter where you are if you buy additional copies.\nAt the end of the campaign we will send you a survey where you can choose to add additional copies of JunKing or other Add-ons and let us know where to ship the product. At that time shipping will be calculated. If you are overcharged in shipping, we will work with you to refund the difference.\nSocial Media Avatars:  \nClick the Image for our Selection of Social Media Avatars", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has done a great deal of homework about producing our own game and we feel confident that our campaign to release this game will be successful.

I've wanted to share these conversations publicly for quite some time, but haven't had the bandwidth until now.

To date, I have recorded 24 thirty-minute episodes with leading marketers from the worlds of tech, media, consumer goods, healthcare, non-profit, service, and retail.

This show isn't a sales pitch in the guise of a podcast; it's real marketers talking to real marketers about what's actually moving the needle today. Building a business is never \"set it and forget it\". Non-stop innovation is required just to be in the game.\n\"Sounds so good. You have a great radio voice!! Shut up and take my money!!

His relevant online marketing topics, beautifully designed and engaging presentations, style and manner are things that our audiences love.\" - Will Hansen Inman News\nThe reason I've decided to launch this on KickStarter is, as it turns out, producing a high-quality audio podcast is a pretty costly endeavor. Podcasting is experiencing a renaissance with standout shows like Startup and Serial raising the bar for production value, writing, and audio talent. Throwing together a free, low-quality podcast just doesn't cut it anymore. Sound engineering alone comes in at about $100 per episode. Once you add audio hosting, web hosting, and music licensing, that cost just about doubles. My goal is to create a podcast in which you find value every week, but delivering that value comes at a cost.\nWith just a modicum of money invested thus far, by working nights and weekends, I've managed to book world-class guests, like Ann Handley of Marketing Profs, Joe Chernov of Hubspot, Brian Dean of Backlinko, and content marketer Barry Feldman. I've also interviewed professionals from all over the world who are building amazing businesses; people with wildly divergent viewpoints on every marketing topic, tactic and strategy you could imagine. After months of research and preparation, I'm now ready to launch the show as a weekly podcast and share the inside scoop on marketing from folks who are actually making it happen. With your help, we are \"READY TO CREATE AN AWESOME PODCAST!\" \n\"Seth's presentation style is casual, motivational, and always contains oodles of real-world examples to visually share his story. I always look forward to hearing him speak.\" - Debra Trappen\nIn order to do this, the show needs to have a more secure infrastructure in place. The support funds will be used as follows: \nFirst, to pay the sound engineer to do the amazing audio production on each episode, so they are a pleasure to your ears. \nSecond, to pay for audio hosting, web hosting, editing and office admin.  \nWe've committed to turning out 52 episodes a year and will use the funds raised on Kickstarter to get each of these recorded, produced, hosted, and promoted.\nThe funding sought here is meant to produce a full season of the show--and to do it immediately--and to build a strong foundation for the show going forward.\nSo far, The Craft of Marketing is off to a great start. This is a labor of love; this program stems from a desire to learn from the professionals in the world that are doing great things marketing their businesses, their brands, and themselves. These are the secrets that marketers and business owners share about amongst themselves, but rarely talk about in public. \nCome learn with me.\nSincerely,\nSeth \n\"I never know what I will learn from Seth, but I always end up with some great takeaways.\" - Sean Carpenter\nAwesome T-Shirt Reward\nBe Human T-Shirt\n Awesome Coffee Mug Reward\nBe Human Coffee Mug Design\nI\u2019m a content marketer, an entrepreneur, and a startup guy who's super-passionate about helping others build their businesses in ways that add value to the world.

If we reach our goal of $8000, we will be able to finish these films, make film prints and bring them to a venue near you - continuing our live methods of psychic exchange with our audiences. And speaking of exchange, look at our rewards which include limited-edition art, DVDs, palm & tarot readings, shaman sessions, astrology readings, herbal gifts and more!\nTHE FULL STORY\nA series of psychically expanded cinema projects by Magical Approach (Brittany Gravely and Ken Linehan), the Telepathy Sessions were born out of various attempts at remote viewing/drawing, co-meditation and other methods of telepathic messaging. The impressions and visions we experience during our ongoing telepathic communiqu\u00e9s are compared, with common threads becoming themes and subjects of investigation for new work via the unique, alchemical medium of 16mm film.\nOur shared visions led us to work on sets of short films only possible in the uniquely malleable, beautiful medium of 16mm film. These are designed to be shown on their own in a traditional theater set-up or projected during a live performance where they are then subject to various rearrangements in the placement; modification and spatialization of the audio; and manipulation with filters, mattes, mirrors or prisms. Both spontaneously and strategically, the various recombinations are adjusted in order to fully inhabit and accommodate the specifics of our location or audience. Additional third strands of film, consisting of shapes, words and other imagery may be added into the mix to further alter the configuration of images and draw new relationships between them.\nTHE FILMS\nClick on the stills to watch excerpts of the films.\nTELEKINESIS LESSON 6\nTelekinesis Lesson 6 - Stills from Film Scan\nTelekinesis Lesson 6 - More stills from Film Scan\nTelekinesis Lesson 6 features kinetic performances in the intimate realms of ritual, ceremony, art and play \u2013 where the natural and supernatural intersect. The first in the Telepathy Sessions series and the closest to completion, this flexible film will have the ability to be projected with an optical sync soundtrack or included as a part of multiple-projection scenarios with live sound. Telekinesis Lesson has become a prototype for our Tarot Card Cycle (see below). The stars are mystical participants Jenn Pipp and Colleen Dowling.\nFIRST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION\nFirst Hypnotic Suggestion - Stills from Film Scan\nFirst Hypnotic Suggestions - More stills from Film Scan\nFirst Hypnotic Suggestions - More stills from Film Scan\nMid-way through completion, First Hypnotic Suggestion consists of two separate reels of 16mm film which will be screened together with or without a third projection and our live manipulation. This is part of a suite of films which will feature a stereo soundtrack, using one reel to reproduce the left channel and the other producing the right \u2013 somewhat simulating the spatialization of our live events and occupying the space with more depth than the standard 16mm mono track. Once printed, if we cannot be present with these films, we will simply urge the projectionist to color filter and manipulate to his/her heart\u2019s desire.\nFirst Hypnotic Suggestion conjures telepathic transference, hypnosis and the collective dream space. Through its spectral tele-cinematic waves, our analogue horror-film protagonists participate in paranormal and fringe scientific experiments, attempting to comprehend the immaterial and incomprehensible expanses of their perception \u2013 both aided and obstructed by technological mediation that defines their expanded cinematic space.\nThis film and others in the Hypnotic series will merge rephotographed and original material working to transform one another through their interactions; the shadows of these collectively unconscious horror and science fiction structures exposing their communion with psycho-spiritual catharsis, extra sensory perception, esoteric mythology and ancient rites.\nTAROT CARD CYCLE \nStar Traveler - Stills from film scan\nWilla - Stills from film scan\nGlenna - Stills from film scan\nMelissa - Stills from film scan\nThe most recent manifestation of our psychic sessions is a set of cinematic tarot cards in which we collaborate with the subjects to create layered vignettes infused with personal symbolism. By choosing costumes, objects, actions and locations that represent their own visions, the stars of these films bring forth what they want to manifest mythically and physically within their lives. Inspired by their particular choices and personalities, we collaborate throughout the shoot, double-exposing each roll of film as a toss of the alchemical I ching to the beguiling discoveries of the serendipitous while adding a spectral layer. Sealed into the receptive emulsion, these layered iconographies are then awakened with the projection of light. In this way the participants' ideal selves are realized, and then affirmed by audiences who naturally recognize parts of their own dreams. \nTo date we have filmed four different tarot portraits and screened rough versions of two. Currently, a digital version of our tarot of artist Faith Johnson is on view in her installation at the Childrens' Museum in Boston, The Star Travelers' Dreams.\nOUR MAGICAL REWARDS TO YOU\nMagical Approach Oracle Cards - See our Rewards!\nORACLE CARDS\nDuring our recent film performances, we have asked audience members to select from a deck of cards which contain imagery conjured through our remote viewing experiments. Functioning like tarot or oracle cards, but resembling Zener ESP cards & psychological test images, these symbols may also appear during our live shows activating alternate connections to the visions onscreen. The viewer\u2019s chosen symbol serves as a personal divination within our films but also beyond. In our first tests of these cards, we discovered that most audience members cutting a card from the deck invariably chose symbols already meaningful to them.\nSee our rewards for a complete set of Magical Approach Oracle Cards ( 25 Card Deck ) Beautiful, limited edition designed by Magical Approach, printed by <a href=\"http://www.dwriletterpress.net\">DWRI Letterpress</a> and packaged in a special canvas pouch made by Providence artist Haley O\u2019Connor. Develop your innate abilities as an oracle!\nASTROLOGY READINGS BY SAM OGDEN\nSam has been practicing astrology in-depth since 2011, and dabbling since a teen. He has always been interested in magic, dreams, spirits, and other realms, but it wasn\u2019t until 2007 when Uranus was touring his 8th house, that he began to follow and explore his curiosities of the occult. Apart from astrology, Sam is a fiber artist, a yoga teacher, a traveler, an earthen builder, and a damn good cook.

And we hope that will include you!\n\nOur films are shot on or include footage rephotographed with a 16mm Bolex camera. Sounds originate from sources that are found, recorded or generated both acoustically and synthetically via analog and digital methods. We use a mix of owned and borrowed equipment and often rely on the support of others paid by reciprocal favors rather than the more common, yet sometimes less freely-flowing dollar system. \n\nSince not everyone is able to accept these alternate forms of payment yet, your vital contributions will fund the alchemical processing of many beautiful, rich strands of the age-old divinatory medium of 16mm. Its power to create decadently saturated shapes has become so precious, so unique, the requisite sacrifices to Kodak and others have likewise increased. By supporting us, you are also helping to support and perpetuate the wondrous existence of 16mm film!\n\nMany of these earth dollars will be used to cover various film laboratory procedures \u2013 like a little negative cutting, optical soundtrack developing, color correction, printing and duplicating, transportation, shipping, miscellaneous fees and transfer to the digital realm for preview purposes (as well as-if you look at our rewards, a unique DVD just for you). The beauty and depth and particular qualities of film are essential to the processes and projections we explore in our experiments. For instance, hand-processing effects and blind double-exposure are impossible in the digital world.\n\nWith a few of our films already very close to the final printing stages, the amount we are requesting will cover the completion of the short films Telekinesis Lesson Six, First Hypnotic Suggestion (double-projected), and two or three tarot card portraits. As you\u2019ll see in the rewards, you can even add to our output by personally producing a portrait of yourself! With full funding from this campaign, all of these films would be completed on film by the fall of 2015 (digital copies for those so rewarded ready in July).\n\nWe want to bring these films to you and for you to bring them to us! Experimental film is often difficult to fund, so we are exploring these alternative methods, which involve a different kind of work, a different kind of exchange. We are well on our way and your collaboration is vital to help us complete these films.

Your journey has an end. Will you survive long enough to reach it?\nAuthentic Survival: With survival tactics and wilderness dangers based on real-life references, staying alive until the end will mean staying warm, staying dry, staying healthy, and avoiding the ravenous wildlife that wants to eat you.\nA unique world inspired by backwater America: Post-Apocalypse or just Post-Society? Did it all end with a bang or a whimper? The world of The Flame in the Flood explores what happens on the fringes when civilization gives up the ghost.\nMusic from Chuck Ragan: Featuring an original full length soundtrack by acclaimed Alt-Country rocker Chuck Ragan featuring The Camaraderie, The Fearless Kin and other special guests.\nSurviving the hostile post-societal wilderness is no picnic. Scrounge for food and supplies, evade the ravenous wild-life, seek out shelter, maintain your raft, and stay healthy. And most important of all, make sure you\u2019re gone when the rains arrive.\nLooting and Crafting\nThe land is dangerous but bountiful, and if you know what you\u2019re looking for, you might just live. And if you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, perhaps you can make it, if you have the pieces.\nAfflictions and Remedies\nSnake bites, fatigue, hypothermia, open wounds, and infection are just some of the ways the world will try to kill you. Happily every affliction has its remedies, whether traditional herbal cures, wound-dressings, or simply a solid night\u2019s sleep. Knowing which remedies slow or stop which afflictions is what separates a babe in the woods from a master survivalist. \nOne piece of advice: address your afflictions in a timely manner, before they develop into something worse.\nAI Ecology\nEverything needs to eat to survive, and to your predators, you\u2019re just a sack of food wrapped in a buckskin parka and cute hat. Like the river itself, our AI encounters are procedurally generated, and the NPCs behave according to rules governing hunger, fear, aggression, and territory. You\u2019ll need to use stealth, traps, distractions, timing, and your wits to avoid becoming a feast for scavengers. \nPermadeath\nWhen you\u2019re done, you\u2019re done, and if you don\u2019t make it, you go back to the head of the river to try again.\nBut remember: Aesop your faithful hound, will be back with whatever he was carrying at the time of your last death. A small mercy from an otherwise cruel fate.\nIt was clear the time to move had come when the first rain fell and the cloud mass that spoke of the coming flood rolled south. Scout lashed her few belongings to her raft and set out for higher ground as the water drowned her cook fire. Her only companion the dog whom she had raised from a pup after finding it tangled in a muddy old sack in a river eddy. Her journey would take her through unfamiliar lands of crumbling relics from long ago. It would be a hungry trek, with scarce supplies, cold winds and rain always chasing and weakening her. She would have to build her own supplies from the pieces of scrap she could scrounge, conserve her food for long tracts of barren scrubland, ration what clean water she could find for the days ahead.\n\u201cSalvation lies at the end of the river\u201d people say. Scout and her old dog have a long and terrifying journey ahead of them.\nScout You play as Scout, a lone wanderer schooled in the art of wilderness survival. She's seen a bit of everything as she's come of age, and knows how to deal with the challenges of staying alive in a land that isn't interested in helping.\nAesop \"It was not my fault, master; my spirit was as good as ever, but I could not help mine infirmities. I rather deserve to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for what I am.\" - from Aesop\u2019s Old Hound\nAesop is Scout's companion and beast of burden. He's been by her side for years, and though he\u2019s not much use in a scrap, he can carry supplies, call out clues and warnings, and generally help you navigate the wilderness.\nThe Raft Your \"piece of ship\", a lashed together junk pile that can take a beating and keep floating. You\u2019ll need to take care of it on your journey, fixing it up if you have a hard crash, but if you do it\u2019ll get you where you\u2019re headed. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll take a swim and it\u2019s game over.\n\u201cI do not know much about gods; but I think that the river Is a strong brown god\u2014sullen, untamed and intractable\u201d ~ T.S. Eliot\nThe river journey is a story that stretches from mythology, through classic literature (Huckleberry Finn, Life on the Mississippi, Heart of Darkness) to the film and television of today (Mud, Beasts of the Southern Wild). In The Flame in the Flood, we want to translate all of the poetry, adventure, quirkiness, and melancholy of those works into video game form.\nThe River is the central character of the game. It is the road that sweeps you ahead of the coming storm. It is a place of rest and calm when it slows and of frantic action and danger when you hit the rapids.\nRiver Tech The Flame in the Flood might not look like your typical roguelike, but it does have one important aspect in common with that genre -- the use of procedural generation algorithms to pseudo-randomly create the world as you move through it. Why \u201cpseudo\u201d random? Because driving the randomness are a set of rules for making rivers that are fun and challenging to navigate, and provide for the many interesting choices you, the player, will face: risk the rapids to get ahead of the coming rain? Hit the store on the eastern bank or the gas station on the western? If I miss that gas station, when will the next one be?\nOur river creation process is divided into a number of steps, including layout, island packing, flow generation, decoration, and rendering. More on all of this in an update soon!\nThe music for the game is being created by Chuck Ragan featuring The Camaraderie, The Fearless Kin and other special guests. You may know Chuck Ragan for his solo work, his time with post-hardcore trailblazers Hot Water Music, or as founder of The Revival Tour. He's writing an original full length album to accompany the release of the game.\nChuck is releasing \u201cThe Flame in the Flood\u201d on iTunes. This is the song used in our video. Go pick it up! Additionally, check out his upcoming tour dates. If you drop by his show in Cambridge, MA, on December 11th, you may just run into one of us.\nIf you are only interested in the soundtrack, it will be available for purchase at a later date.\n  Sound design is being handled by Pat Balthrop, founder of Interactive Sound & Fury. He is an audio director and sound designer with multiple BAFTA nominations, two best audio awards at the Game Developer\u2019s Conference, Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, and nine awards from the Game Audio Network Guild.\nHis work has been heard in BioShock Infinite, The Beatles: Rock Band, BioShock, Rock Band 2, Dance Central, Rock Band 3, and more.\nPat is an all around great person, and we\u2019re really excited to work with him again on this project.\nGwen Frey, Chad LaClair, Forrest Dowling, Scott Sinclair, Damian Isla, Bryn Bennett.

Lots can go wrong. We\u2019re a small team and it will still be possible to fail, even if we successfully kickstart.\n\nTeam: sometimes life can hit people in unexpected ways. Everyone on our team is necessary, so if extenuating circumstances prevent any individual from working on the game, the whole project will be at risk. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not much we can do to eliminate this risk, without holding enough money in the bank to pay a competitive salary to replace someone should some catastrophe occur. In games, hiring an engineer or an art director can easily cost our entire budget, so without doubling or tripling our budget as an insurance policy, this will simply be a risk we need to take.\n\nCreative: Making games involves taking creative risks, and they don\u2019t always pan out. You can lose time correcting from choices that don\u2019t end up working as well in practice as you imagined they would. This is often why games go over budget and dates slip. We have a production plan in place that allows for a large amount of leeway prior to the actual date we\u2019d like to ship. We know the creative process can take time, so we\u2019re scoping in order to hit our dates.\n\nTechnical: usually games can present enormous technical challenges. This is a low risk for us, as we\u2019re using Unreal Engine 4, an engine that we are all very experienced with. Collectively, we have decades of experience working with Unreal. This is a new sort of game for some of us, so of course there will be unknowns to overcome, but each member of the team has shipped multiple games across multiple platforms, and we know how to successfully ship a technically sound title.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "An update on Drake Hollow, our next title!", "update_content": "Hi Folks,\nWe've not updated this thing in a long while, because well... there's not been much to share, but today we finally have something new to announce.

What about a new setting? What changes in a new setting? Bit by bit we ended up with what we're showing off today: A co-op action sandbox game about building villages to protect fun little creatures called Drakes that need your help. It's not rogue-like, or permadeath, or survival. It's still procedurally generated, but that's about where the similarities end.

JAPAN (ThousandarmedKannon)\n1. In terms of printing size, Titan 1 can print up to 9.5\u201d tall with a 7.54\u201d x 4.25\u201d build base at 100 micron XYZ resolution, which is the tallest among all personal SLA printers.\nIn addition to bigger prints, Titan 1 can print multiple objects at the same time.\nby EmbeddedJunkie (Minions with expressions), KEVINhenderson (robocop minion), Tony (Parametric Minion from Despicable Me), Doodle Monkey (Minion Practical Joker), Chiefprinting21 (Despicable Me Minion), Noah Beasley: improbablecog.com (Carapace Ring)\n2. Titan 1 is the fastest personal SLA printer in the market today. For other SLA printers to print a 4.6 inch Eiffel tower with 100 micron Z resolution, it takes anywhere from 4 to 6 hours. With Titan 1, it only takes 2 hours. \nTitan 1's maximum speed for xy:50\u03bcm and z:100\u03bcm resolution is about 2.7 inches / hr and 1.3 inches / hr for xyz:100\u03bcm resolution. Compared with FDM type 3D printers, Titan 1 is five times faster and has much better resolution and surface smoothness.\n3. Titan 1 can print at resolutions that are 5 times better than FDM printers while completing the project at a faster speed. Titan 1 can print pillar features as fine as a strand of hair. The small Eiffel tower above is printed at 37 micron XYZ resolution. The mini rings below are printed at 37 micron XY and 30 micron Z resolution.\nEasily Adjustable for Multiple Usages\nTitan 1 is the most flexible SLA 3D printer with easily adjustable functions to maximize speed or resolution - allowing it to be used for multiple purposes.\nSome 3D printers focus on resolution but are only able to print small objects. On the other hand, other printers can print larger objects while sacrificing resolution (which are still not as large as what Titan 1's).\nTitan 1 is specifically designed for users to easily make adjustments with the widest range of printing sizes and resolution in the market today. Titan 1 is so flexible that it can print larger objects, and can be adjusted to increase resolution and print smaller objects. Speed, resolution, and size can be optimized based on user preferences.\nYou can be a creator and bring your imagination to life. \nJewelry for Jewelry Designers\nby Jonathan Iyar (Graduation Ring), wholestory (Another brutal print test - Ring), Roman Heggin (Bracelet - Voronoi Style),  (Voronoi Bracelet), Nathan Caswell (Defensive Spikes Bracelet), Janis Kelm (My Customized Bracelet Designer)\nArt work for Artists  \nMolds, Parts, and Prototypes for Engineers and Product Designers \nModels and Prototypes for Architects and Designers \nDesign and research models for Teachers and Students \nAnd many other uses including prototyping and samples for small businesses and niche applications, such as hearing aid molds and dental study models\nby PerryT (Chinese Ball-2), Mitch Raducanoiu (Le Rhone 9 cilinder engine for Fokker DR I from Electifly),  David Nguyen (iPhone 5 Case)\n by Mr Fab (Batman), sjuskadur (Mr Bean Bust), Razumnick (Angel), Rustin Atkeisson (Dragon), cyclone (\"Okay\"), fantasygraph (Kiss me), Yahoo!

During printing, users can easily switch between different colored resins to achieve the desired coloration.\nby Hroncok (Statue of Liberty with base building), Hiroaki Nishimura (Stratum-Vase_001), Ben Malouf (Zigzag Vase)\nReward Levels\nTitan 1 comes with a gorgeous acrylic cover in two colors - Red and Orange.\nThe Standard Ruby package includes the printer with the RED ruby cover, resin, and the starter kit.\nThe Premium Diamond package includes the printer with the ORANGE diamond cover, resin, and the starter kit. It also includes an extra build platform, resin container, resin, and a Kudo3D shirt.  This bonus will enable you to print projects or use different colors back to back by simply swapping out these components with the unused set. You can also print multiple colors without cleaning up the resin in the first container.  The premium package will greatly enhance your printing experience.\nMany SLA 3D printer users need to post-cure their printouts in the sun before being able to use the objects. We developed a Post-Curing UV LED Lamp so that our users can shorten the post-curing time and be able to post-cure regardless of rain or shine. Our UV LED Lamp is available as its own pledge level of $349. It is also included in two other pledge levels, which are bundled with the Ruby and Diamond packages.\nOur Starter Kit includes:\nA metal spatula to separate the printed models from the build table\nA lens cleaner brush to remove dusts from the projector lens \nScissors to separate support from printed objects\nTo minimize the shipping and handling cost,  70% of the assembling labor is completed prior to shipment. Users will need to assemble the upper portion of the printer, including the linear stage module, build platform, and the acrylic cover.  Users will then just need to screw the projector on the frame, and the printer will be ready to use. The assembling process is simple - it's as simple as assembling IKEA furniture! Following the instructions, it should take less than 2 hours for a layman to finish assembling.  \nThe frame, which includes 12 pieces of metal, has the highest complexity to assemble - but it\u2019ll come assembled for you!\nThe resin included in regular packages will be a 500 mL bottle of black resin. The additional resin in premium packages will be an extra 500 mL bottle of red resin. For additional resin, please add $70 to your pledge for 3 more 500 mL resin bottles. We have 2 add-on options for additional packages of 3 resin bottles - Option A (black, yellow, green) and Option B (white, red, blue).\nFor an additional PSP resin container - please add $55. For an additional build platform, please add $90.\nOur future retail price will be higher than our printer pledge amounts so take advantage of the DISCOUNTED PRICES now! Our first shipment date will have an LIMITED AMOUNT of 450 printers.\nTechnological Breakthrough\nIn order to expand the reach of SLA technology to private homes and small businesses, Kudo3D improves on two major issues with the current SLA process: reliability and cost. Our goal was to develop a low-cost high-performance SLA 3D printer with high reliability. \nModularizing components \nFirst, SLA technology\u2019s cost is high due to maintenance and materials. Kudo3D addresses these issues by modularizing components and using higher quality parts. Titan 1\u2019s high resolution is produced by the high precision ball screw linear stage module, which is often seen on high-end semiconductor equipments. \nTitan 1's commercial-grade HD 1080p projector and patent-pending resin container are key to its higher reliability, lifetime durability, and speed. The projector is used to generate patterns, making the Titan 1 adjustable and more reliable. Titan 1\u2019s projector solidifies a layer in a two-dimensional fashion without mechanical movements. This reduces the likelihood of mechanical failure compared to the conventional one-dimensional laser drawing technique, which requires rotating two motors continuously. Titan 1\u2019s resolution can be easily tuned without complicated laser alignment and calibrations by applying a bottom-up SLA configuration. By implementing a bottom-up printing configuration coupled with our flexible resin container, we only need to use a single stepping motor. \nKudo3D\u2019s engineering team spent 16 months working around the clock in order to develop and perfect its patent-pending passive self-peeling (PSP) technology, which minimizes the separation force of cured layers. Our proprietary flexible PSP resin container consists of 6 different materials. Therefore, features as tiny as a strand of hair can be preserved during the printing process. \nOur Secret Sauce - Proprietary PSP Container\nSince our PSP technology utilizes Teflon, our container is immune to the attack of more reactive resins, which is a huge pain for most of our competitors. Titan 1 users can use materials from most commercial SLA resin vendors by simply adjusting the exposure time. \nIn order to reduce software costs to the consumer, while still maintaining quality and adaptability, we use open source Pronterface and Slic3r. We further reduced costs by applying the open source RAMPS 1.4 and Mega 2560 for the control circuits. \nFinally, we couldn\u2019t let this beautiful collection of high quality parts sit in a heap, so we framed them in and covered the frame in a gorgeous snap-on brushed aluminum and acrylic enclosure. Since our printer is modularized, it is very easy to assemble, maintain, upgrade, and manufacture. \nTitan 1 is simple, elegant, and easy to use \u2013 while keeping costs and the headaches of upkeep at an all time low.\n***Product Warranty***\nMost Kickstarter projects are not able to offer a warranty, but we are proud to offer a limited manufacturer warranty for the linear translation stage module and the HD projector. \nSo why are we on Kickstarter? \nWe spent the last 1 and a half years forming a well-rounded team of engineering, design, and business experts. It was an ambitious project, which led us through prototypes after prototypes, and resulted in the creation of the Titan 1.\nIt is now ready for production, and we need your help in bringing our first batch of products to life. With the aid of our backers, we will expand our team and allocate resources to setting up a manufacturing line in the US. Please support us in any way that you can and help us get the word out about the Titan 1!\nOnce we reach our goal, our manufacturing process will begin. We aim to deliver the first batch of Titan 1s by November.  If the pre-order volume surpasses our initial suppliers\u2019 capacity, we have already secured back up suppliers to meet the demand and to help ensure on-time delivery.  All parts will be shipped to California for final inspections before packaging and shipping.    \nOur Story: the Birth of Titan 1\nKudo3D was founded by Tedd Syao, PhD. Tedd was a professor in electrical engineering and has 15 years of experience in the Photonics industry and academics. He utilized photolithography technology to pattern sub-micron laser devices. With his expertise in photolithography, he was inspired to streamline a similar technology used in 3D printing, which is known as stereolithography or SLA. \nKudo3D ardently believes that 3D printing will change the world and that it will incite the next industrial revolution. To drive the revolution forward, Kudo3D was founded in 2012 and embarked upon a mission to construct a 3D printer that surpasses those on the market in speed, efficiency, reliability, scale, and resolution. Our dream is to make SLA printers available to everyday households.\nPrevious Prototypes Just for Kicks\nThe Final Designs\nProduction Plan\nThe Team Behind Titan 1\nWe are all very excited to make Titan 1 a reality!\nCompatible with most Commercially Available Resin\nTitan 1 is compatible with most resins designed for 400 nanometer SLA printers.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKudo3D proudly partners with one of the leading resin providers, Makerjuice Labs.\nThe resin we are offering is the SubG+ from MakerJuice. SubG+ has fast curing and low shrinkage (with measured shrink <3.5%!).  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor jewelry designers, castable resin will be available around our first shipment. We will provide updates throughout the campaign.\nKudo3D T-Shirts (and Team \"Models\")\nSpecial thanks to these media outlets for featuring the Titan 1!\nDisclaimer:\nThe printed figures are used to demonstrate that Titan 1 can print various objects only.

For more updates remember to visit our website, follow us on Twitter or like us on Facebook!\nIt all began in August 2013 during the 7 Day First Person Shooter game challenge, where we decided to make something that really stood out in the genre. Our concept was a title that felt dynamic and satisfying, while not requiring superhuman reflexes. Something like a game of real-time chess, except that all the pawns are out there to murder you. We released a public demo...\nYou can also check out the video reactions to our prototype: [Markiplier] [OfficialNerd\u00b3] [CupQuake] [JackSepticEye] [FavijTV] [JackFrags]\n... and then - the Internet went crazy. We have been featured on Kotaku, The Verge, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, and WIRED among many others. SUPERHOT made it to the front page of Reddit (twice) and went through Steam Greenlight during a single weekend. Thanks to the amazingly positive responses we've decided that we want to develop SUPERHOT into a full blown game!\nSUPERHOT is a unique, stylized FPS game where the time moves only when you move. With this simple mechanic we've been able to create gameplay that's not all about reflexes - the player's main weapon is careful aiming and smart planning - while not compromising on the dynamic feeling of the game.\nYou're not hiding behind cover - you're dodging bullets flying past you like in The Matrix. You're not waiting to reload a gun - you're picking the next firearm from the hands of your fallen foes. You're not waiting until your wounds heal - in SUPERHOT a single bullet means death. However, there are no reload screens - you're instantly back in the middle of the action. \nSUPERHOT wouldn't have made it this far if not for the support of gamers, the press, and fellow developers. Since the original prototype we've basically rewritten the game from the ground-up to make it more expandable, dynamic and resulting in a much smoother experience. \nDuring these eight months we've fixed a lot of the problems with the original version of the game, heavily reiterated on the art style, and experimented with fun scenarios for the players to \"solve\" - shootout in a subway train, showdown on the top of a skyscraper in rain, jumping into a moving elevator, and more.\nWe've still got a lot of work (new mechanics, more levels, better animation, rigorous testing and optimization) ahead of us, but the core of SUPERHOT is in place and it's unlike anything you've seen before.\nTurning to Kickstarter ensures that we have access to a constant stream of feedback and ideas, while maintaining control over the development. We have the skills and experience needed to complete the game and we've been working on SUPERHOT non-stop for the past eight months, but we need your help to make it even better!\nThe initial goal of $100k will allow us to cover the costs of living for the team, purchase required hardware, software licences and assets that will allow us to finish the game faster, and to hire additional help - graphic artists, animators, level designers and sound technicians - that will assist us in making SUPERHOT a complete game. All funds over $100k will go directly into making the game better and covering the costs of promoting the game on various gaming events around the world.\nStory driven single-player campaign. SUPERHOT is more than just a shooter with a gimmick. We want to deliver a solid, interesting campaign built around a carefully constructed, not overly in-your-face story.\nImproved visuals. We are keeping the original game's minimalistic artstyle while making everything look a lot better. SUPERHOT is all about style.\nInfinite mode. A lot of people have asked us for an endless, arena-style mode that will allow them to play SUPERHOT for as long as they want. Master the game's mechanics and get ready for the ultimate time-bending challenges.\nMore weapons - shotguns, machineguns, grenades that change the way you play around with the time-bending mechanics.\nMore enemy types - thanks to improved AI the foes will use tactics and be able to work together to hunt you down.\nMore levels - imagine fighting in the middle of a motorway during rush hour, or close combat in an elevator - and other amazing, movie-like scenarios.\nSlow-motion explosions!\nOculus Rift support.

Published by Sony, these games became legendary for their unique soundtracks, their snappy, frenetic action and the zen-like \"flow states\" that players entered into when they got into the groove. \nOriginal game screen and box cover art. The Amplitude logo is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.\nBoth fans and reviewers REALLY liked the game. Some select quotes from back in the day:\nIn the 11 years since Amplitude\u2019s release, Harmonix has gone on to create true pop culture phenomena with the original Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Central. Still, there was a quiet clawing in the back of our minds. Pleas from Amplitude fans, strangers on the street, and veterans of the studio - we needed to revisit this era of gaming and update it for the modern age! \nWith the advancements in technology and the huge creative leaps forward our studio has taken, we believe we can rebuild Amplitude for current consoles and make it an even more amazing experience than before. We're aiming to deliver an updated soundtrack, incredible visuals, and fine-tuned controls. These improvements will be layered on top of the core mechanics and hallmark difficulty that made both FreQuency and Amplitude such amazing experiences when they first debuted. We\u2019re confident that we can make a game that will do its predecessors justice!\n\n  Early Crippler concept - Purple player launched a debilitating power-up on the green player.\nDuring Rock Band, we perfected our methodology for \u201cbeatmatching\u201d, which we intend to apply to this new title. We\u2019ll also be moving the game into the new proprietary engine Harmonix has developed over the past 10 years. In addition to better control over timing windows, this will also allow us to run at 60 frames per second and smoothly port the existing mechanics to PS3 and PS4.\nThe game, as designed for this Kickstarter, focuses on the core Amplitude experience. Single player and local multiplayer are included in the design, as are leaderboards for online bragging rights. The Beat Blaster (the ship), music notes, tracks and FX will all be modernized and gorgeous. The cyberworld around the tracks will be designed by artists and crafted by coders so that every pixel on screen can be driven by the underlying music. Even as we work through our plans for this Kickstarter, the game is beginning to take shape \u2013 an HD reinvisioning of the cult classic, smartly updated for today on every axis. We believe this is the game that fans of Amplitude have been asking for and a game that can only come from Harmonix.\nEarly Beat Blaster concepts\nMusic is at the heart of Amplitude. The all-new soundtrack will focus on songs with an electronic-based feel, with tones spanning dark and moody to bright and bouncing. \nOur award-winning audio team is uniquely capable of composing amazing music with ideal GAMEPLAY in mind. All the amazing patterns and runs that made Amplitude's gameplay so fun need sick music crafted to match perfectly. For this game, we plan to focus our efforts on music that is custom-created for the game. This has the best chance of creating KILLER gameplay feel and a well-balanced list of songs. And you can help us pick which tracks make it into the final shipping tracklist! Take a look at our backer rewards for more details on how you can make your voice heard, contribute tracks to the game, or get your hands on a limited edition vinyl soundtrack!\nLimited edition colored vinyl (mockup)\nAt its higher difficulty levels, Amplitude was hard as hell. We\u2019re talking \u201cDark Souls\u201d hard, but with music. We know that fans of the original will be expecting that same level of challenge in this new version, and we won\u2019t disappoint. The game will still feature its hallmark difficulty as you progress.\nIn the years since Amplitude, Harmonix developers have become masters at making rhythm games fun for everybody. While we\u2019re focused on designing this project to appeal to a \u201chardcore\u201d base, we intend for fans of more recent Harmonix products to feel right at home with this new game as well, if they\u2019re willing to put in the practice and hone their skills!\nOriginal Amplitude team members still rocking it at Harmonix\nMany of the original developers who made this game a classic are still here at Harmonix, and psyched to update the experience for all players.\nThese veteran developers will be joined by the best rhythm game devs in the industry, folks who\u2019ve shipped dozens of AAA titles. We\u2019re ready to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience that players can pick up and enjoy. This is a game only Harmonix can make, on time and on budget. But we know that we can't do it without your help.\nThe levels are dark and quiet on entry, but jump to life as players release the musical notes.\nOur aim with this Kickstarter is to be humble in our expectations. The current goal is to make a faithful Amplitude \"HD\" - the core experience from PS2\u00ae re-developed for modern gaming devices. We certainly have LOTS of crazy ideas that could blow this concept out. Your contribution, feedback, and community input will decide where this project will land and how many crazy ideas we can incorporate!\nEarly Beat Blaster sketches\nThis project is intended to be a love letter to old-school PS2\u00ae fans, but we need to know that this is something you actually want. This is the project WE desperately want to make, but we can\u2019t do it without your interest and support. Help us prove that there is a place for challenging, high-polished rhythm-action games in the modern age!\nTiers (Updated 5.20.14)\nReward Grid (Updated 5.20.14)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNEW PLATFORMS!\n\nWe haven't shipped a game on PlayStation\u00ae4. New platforms always come with some minor learning curves, BUT we have great producers and partners at Sony and we're confident we'll be able to overcome any obstacles\n\nTIMELINE AND TECHNOLOGY ROADMAP:\n\nThere are technical limitations to overcome in order to get the game running at 60 fps (a requirement to make all musical timing feel snappy). We have a strong plan about how to adapt our proprietary engine for these purposes, especially on PS4, but it is a risk.\n\n\nMUSIC LICENSING AND SOUNDTRACK COMPOSITION\n\nWe want to have the right balance between great electronic songs you know and the type of amazing original compositional work we did in the original PS2\u00ae games. This creative work can take time, become more costly than expected, and generally turn into a headache. That said, we have a LOT of experience in this area and we're confident we can make it work.

Each turn one player grabs both a Perk and a Quirk card. This combination of cards represents a potential lover that player could spend the rest of their life with. Everyone then puts either a Date or Deny voting card face down, to represent what choice they think their friend will make. Individually each player flips their voting card and explains why they believe this is the perfect, or worst match for their friend. In the end, the player who's turn it is reveals how they voted, and why. Everyone that guessed correctly gains a point. This is a conversation building card game. You'll be shocked by how your friends answer. How could someone be okay with dating a mate with tentacles, but have a problem with dating a wizard? Why would someone deny a billionaire, but date a lover with a toaster oven mouth? These are probably questions you never thought you'd be asking about your friends, but that's why this card game exists!\nAwesome Indie Game Cameos Incoming!\nI can't be the only person who saw Octodad and wondered what sort of person would date someone who is secretly an octopus, could I? The kindness and awesomeness of several indie game studios allows me to announce today that we'll have the following game cameos in Billionaire Banshee: \n Octodad by Young Horses \nGo Home Dinosaurs by Fire Hose Games \nGuacamelee by DrinkBox Studios \nBlood Alloy by Suppressive Fire Games \nRoundabout by No Goblin \nThe specifics of how each of these games will be featured in cards is still being figured out, but here's an example...\nThis is really exciting for me, and I'm sure for players who know these games. If you don't know the games mentioned above, click on the studio and you'll be linked to their sites. Seriously, these are all really cool games that deserve your attention.\n Some games are fun to play with your filthy, degenerate friends, and other games are geared towards making boring family get togethers more enjoyable. Some people like the most ridiculous conversations possible, and others want a more intense, grounded game experience. I don't pretend to know what weird way you want to play Billionaire Banshee, but I've made it easy for you to adjust the game on the fly. On both the front and back of each card is a symbol that lets you know what type of content the card contains...\n *image in video shows an outdated Sexy icon\n So why crowdfund Billionaire Banshee? As you can see, with a one person team, costs are being minimized as best as possible, but it's still expensive to make a custom card game. After playing the game with friends, co-workers, family, or strangers, consistently there was feedback that this is a game they would want to be able to buy. This happened every time the game was played and so the feedback was taken seriously, and work was done to do a full release. It's been attempted to be a good value too. There are plenty of other card games with much fewer cards for the same cost (especially if the extra card stretch goals are hit). This can't be made without financial help, and hopefully you agree that Billionaire Banshee should exist.\n I realize some backers may want to pledge to one tier, but get a reward from another tier. If you want an extra copy of the game, add $20 to your pledge. If you want a shirt, add $35. If you want a pillowcase, add $70.

In lieu of exclusives, we have decided to offer the game at the ridiculously low price of $15, but only to Kickstarter backers. This is not a micro game. It is a game with over 125 cards that has a high level of strategy & theme, world class art, and first rate graphic design. The MSRP on Draco Magi will be $25.  Our hope is that a $15 Kickstarter price will encourage you to back this project instead of waiting.

Visit our website for details, and thanks for stopping by here!\nLagoon: Land of Druids is a game about forging the destiny of a world. Players lead circles of druids in search of enchanted sites that offer magic powers and the energy you'll need to bend Lagoon's destiny. Each site belongs to one of three different energies that compete to dominate Lagoon:\nEvery action you take alters the balance of power among these three energies. The energy with the most sites on the board at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny. Position yourself on the winning side of destiny, and you win!\nLagoon: Land of Druids supports 1-4 players. Most games are completed in 60 minutes or less. A game with 4 is a team game. \"The team actually works really well,\" says UndeadViking in his video review below (\"What People Are Saying\" section).\nThe recommended starting tile setup for new players is shown below. Like all setups, it includes one site of each energy to ensure the game begins in a place of balance between the three energies.\nGame setup for two players.\nPlayers alternate turns, using their druids to perform various actions. Common actions include exploring a new site from the bag, moving around the world, summoning a fellow druid back into play, and unraveling a site to remove it from play. \nAdditionally, every site on the board offers a unique magic power. If your druids occupy a site, you can use its power. A fun twist is your druids share their site powers with one another. So if you have five druids on different sites, each of them could use any one of the five site powers. This opens up a lot of tactical play and fun combos.\nMidpoint of 2 player game. Each player has a stack of unraveled sites and acquired seed tokens at bottom left and right.\nThe heart of the game comes down to manipulating how many sites of each energy are on the board, and this is where you'll be trying to outmaneuver your opponents by making better use of all the site powers to carry out your agenda. Explore new sites aligned with an energy you want to support, and gain a seed token matching that energy. Unravel and remove from the board the sites of energies you wish to oppose.\nAt the end of the game, the energy with the majority of sites in play becomes Lagoon's destiny. If you supported that energy better than any other player, you win! The game tracks loyalty to the dominant energy as follows. Seeds of the dominant energy remaining in your supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it's removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.\nUndeadViking Video Review\nGame play explanation begins at 5:35.\nTestimonials\nAdam P. McIver, Designer of Coin Age: \"Lagoon is a board game oxymoron. It somehow manages to feel immediately familiar while also being fresh and different. It simultaneously seems like a classic game and the hot new thing.

He's effortlessly walked the line between Eurogame elegance and Ameritrash atmosphere, blending theme and mechanics so perfectly that it should make every game designer jealous. I really hate him. (JK, I love him but reluctantly.)\nMy impressions of Lagoon were solidified while the game was still a prototype with no real visuals to speak of, and now that I've seen the artwork, my eyes have exploded right out of my head.

The hex tiles are a large 3.5 inches wide (as big as Eclipse tiles for those familiar with that game).\n1 rulebook \n1 round-bottomed drawstring bag for randomizing site tiles \n1 token draw bag for solo mode\n4 player reference cards \n4 player markers / exploration aids\n16 Elemeen seed tokens \n16 Vowelon seed tokens \n16 Deonin seed tokens \n40 cardboard druid tokens (5 each of Mushroom, Hare, Stag, Fern, Owl, Dragonfly, Turtle and Moon)\n40 WOODEN, screen-printed druid tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n36 WOODEN, screen-printed seed tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n24 double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n3 advanced double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n1 BONUS site tile!\n* Prototype components, graphics may change in final version. Forthcoming art will replace gray placeholder illustrations.\nI believe in Lagoon, and want you to believe in it too. So I've made a FREE print and play version of Lagoon: Land of Druids available for anyone to download. Print a copy and play at home today!\nDownload the Lagoon Print and Play\nDownload the Lagoon Rulebook\nI've worked hard to ensure my first board game design will be produced to a high standard of quality. The art will enchant you, and you'll have fun exploring all the possibilities of Lagoon's rich game play. But I have plans to make Lagoon: Land of Druids even more alluring if the project overfunds.\nMy philosophy for stretch goals is that they should make the game better without jeopardizing the schedule or the ultimate success of the game. There's a ton of exciting enhancements we can do within these parameters, and I have a succession of sweet options in mind! \nThe most effective way to achieve upgrades to the game is by sharing this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Please share Lagoon far and wide the world over!\nFirst Stretch Goal - $22,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nA 5th druid circle will be included in the game! \nBackers chose the Owl to be the emblem of the 5th druid circle! This provides an alternate art design for the emblem representing your druid circle, as you boldly forge Lagoon's destiny.\nThe initial four druid circle designs included in the base game are shown above, and the owl design will be completed early this coming week!\nPlease note, however, the addition of these tokens does not allow Lagoon to support 5 players. The balance of Lagoon's game dynamics is excellent with 2 and 3 players, but it does not scale well to 4 or 5 individual players. This is why the 4 player game is played with teams, which feels different but truly makes for a very fun, balanced experience.\nSecond Stretch Goal - $25,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTHICKER COMPONENTS! \nThe Lagoon: Land of Druids punchboards will now be 2.5mm thick instead of the original 2mm. This will make all site tiles, druid tokens, seed tokens, and player markers/exploration aids thicker! Thicker components are more durable, are easier to pick up, and feel more substantial and satisfying to use. They also look a lot more impressive on your table.\nThird Stretch Goal - $30,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSOLO PLAY MODE!\nLagoon: Land of Druids will now be playable for a single player! This will be a great way to play when you're a druid circle of one, or when the game first arrives and you're eager to learn it on your own. More details on this experience will be added soon.\nFourth Stretch Goal - $35,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nCHUNKY THICK COMPONENTS!\nThis enhancement will increase the thickness of the punchboards once more, from a thick 2.5mm to a chunky 3mm! That's right, we're on the threshold of magnificence, where .5mm tips the scales and pushes us into chunky land!\nThis is the thickness every prototype of Lagoon has used for its tiles, and I'm thrilled that this upgrade is well within reach. Considering most board games use 2mm or even 1.5mm thick chipboard for components like Lagoon's tiles, I think you'll love the heft of 3mm tiles in your hand and how impressive they look on your table!\nFifth Stretch Goal - $40,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTWO ADDITIONAL BACKER CHOSEN DRUID CIRCLES!\nA 6th and 7th druid circle design will be included in the game. Note this does not increase the player count above 4, as explained in the first update.\nBackers are nominating nature-themed emblems on the comments page now! To promote druid diversity, the two new emblems will be non-plant, non-fungus, non-bird, non-mammal emblems, as those are already represented. Lastly, I reserve the right to filter out suggestions that aren't thematic.\nSixth Stretch Goal - $50,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSIX ADVANCED SITES ADDED!\nSix \"advanced\" sites will now be included with Lagoon! That's three additional site tiles. Check out Flaming Lotus below, one of the advanced Vowelon sites! \nThe six advanced sites offer potent magic to your druids. They didn't initially make it into the base game because their usefulness is less straightforward, or they're a little tricky to use. But exceedingly useful they are! Now you'll be able to swap out three tiles from the base game for the advanced tiles, or play with all 27 tiles if you want a slightly longer game.\nSeventh Stretch Goal - $60,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nWOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nEvery Kickstarter copy of Lagoon will now include FOUR player sets of wooden druid tokens. That's 20 total druids, which is the full complement for the largest player count of 4. The tokens will be 4mm thick wooden discs, 1mm thicker than the punchboard druid tokens. Also included will be emblem stickers to label the members of each circle of druids.\nThese wooden tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter. I want to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, and that's why these wooden components will not be standard equipment in the retail version of the game. They won't be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, but they will be free to you.\nEighth Stretch Goal - $65,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSCREEN-PRINTED WOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nThe four wooden sets of druid tokens added previously will be upgraded from stickers to screen-printing. The druid circle emblems will be painted directly on the wooden discs. More attractive and durable than stickers, screen-printed wooden druid tokens make a classy and refined addition to Lagoon. And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nNinth Stretch Goal - $75,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nEIGHT SETS OF SCREEN-PRINTED DRUID TOKENS!\nA full eight sets of screen printed wooden druid tokens are included with every backed copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids. That's a total of 40 wooden druid tokens! This includes the four original emblems (Stag, Hare, Fern, Mushroom) as well as the four chosen by backers: Dragonfly, Owl, Turtle, and Moon.  And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nTenth Stretch Goal - $80,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nLAGOON ART DIGITAL WALLPAPER 3-PACK\nThree digital wallpapers of Lagoon art have been unlocked! If you can't wait until then, the sixteenth update has a nice treat for you!\nEleventh Stretch Goal - $90,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n16mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nRendering of seed tokens. Final design may differ.\n36 wooden seed tokens with screen-printed seed designs on both sides are now included with backed copies of Lagoon. This is in addition to the 40 wooden druid tokens unlocked previously, tricking out your copy of Lagoon with a grand total of 76 wooden tokens! This will complete the upgrade of all tokens from punchboard to painted wood.\nSeveral things to note about these tokens:\nThey will NOT be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter!\nThe game will still include all the punchboard seed tokens.\nThese seed tokens (16mm) are smaller than the punchboard seed tokens (19mm). If that saddens you, please take a look at the next stretch goal.\nThis goal provides 12 wooden seed tokens in each energy, whereas there are 16 punchboard seed tokens in each energy. Twelve tokens is actually the number all prototypes of Lagoon have used, which is plenty. We're doing more punchboard seeds because having extras may be handy and we have space for them.\nTwelfth Stretch Goal - $100,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n19mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nAll 36 wooden seed tokens are now upgraded from 16mm to 19mm. The larger size is the same as the punchboard seed tokens.\nAchieving this stretch goal makes every Kickstarter copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids a deluxe experience with a full 76 wooden tokens that will not be included in the base retail version of the game. That's 40 druid tokens in 8 different designs, as well as 36 seed tokens in 3 different designs. \nThirteenth Stretch Goal - $125,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nBONUS PROMO SITE!\nEach backed copy of Lagoon will include a bonus site tile! This promotional tile will introduce a new site type to Lagoon, the totem. Totems are game changing sites that don't behave like the others. Just one totem can completely change the feel of a game, so this bonus site will pack a punch! \nThis promo tile will NOT be included in the base retail version of the game.\nFourteenth Stretch Goal: $150,000\nWEEKLY LAGOON LORE!\nI will lovingly write and share with you a new chapter of Lagoon's lore and history once a week until the game goes out to backers.\nThe first chapter would be delivered by the first week of April, so we're talking at least 18 chapters! Each chapter would profile a new character, give background on a significant location, or cover some overarching topic in the world of Lagoon. We're not talking book sized chapters, but there'll be enough meat on these bones to flesh the world out.\nI could not produce Lagoon without the faith and support of Kickstarter backers. To respect this trust placed in me, I promise that backer copies of Lagoon: Land of Druids will be shipped out before the game is available for purchase at conventions or retail stores. \nI also pledge to keep my backers well informed at each step in the process of producing and delivering Lagoon: Land of Druids. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this project, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nLastly, I'm pleased to announce Lagoon: Land of Druids is now an EU Friendly project!\nIf you've made it all the way down here, thank you for giving my game your attention! Lagoon is the culmination of a dream going back many years to publish my own board games. My favorite games have evocative themes that are tightly woven into the mechanics. I love opening a game box and discovering an entire world beckoning me inside. When I sit down to play a game, I want to feel like I'm exploring a living system filled with mysteries to be solved and dynamics that grip me but aren't easily mastered. To me, that's magic in a box. That's what I want most when I sit down to play a game. \nI've put a lot of love into this game, and I hope when you sit down at your table to play Lagoon that your experience has a handful of these sparks pulling you in and creating memorable experiences with your friends and family.\nI have a big vision for this game and its future, and a dream to publish other outstanding games that are also set in the world of Lagoon. If this world resonates with you, I'm delighted that we've connected! I believe so strongly in what I'm doing that I actually quit my job four months ago to devote most of my time and energy towards building Three Hares Games. It may sound crazy, but I'm taking a leap forward towards forging my own personal destiny, and I'm grateful to anyone who plays a role in it.\nI started a blog to document this wild journey, and invite you to follow along if you like.\nCheers,\nDavid\n Three sizes available in three designs.\nGrizznant, Ancient Forest Lord\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\n Jokulmas, Trickster\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\nElixona, Queen of Dreams\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for this project are possible delays with art, manufacturing, shipping and fulfillment. The schedule includes several weeks of buffer time at different stages in order to absorb a decent amount of unforeseen delays without jeopardizing on-time delivery.\n\nMost of the art has been completed already, and the remaining pieces are scheduled for completion before this campaign even ends. My graphic designer has worked in the board game industry for many years and has the experience to ensure the pre-press phase goes quickly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Panda Game Manufacturing, a very reputable company I've established a good working relationship with going back to August. I'm working with a well-recommended and responsive freight company to manage the logistics of getting the manufactured game from China to warehouses in other countries.\n\nI've analyzed several different fulfillment scenarios to get games to backers, and have evaluated three vendors to handle most of this process for me. I believe I've settled on the most efficient approach for fulfillment. As the project proceeds, I will continually monitor this aspect and shift my strategy if a more efficient approach is possible.\n\nAnother factor I want to disclose is that I will be on a family trip to Alaska at the beginning of August, which could overlap the timeframe that rewards are being distributed to backers. Fortunately, I am not planning to directly handle fulfillment myself, so I don't anticipate this causing problems with that process being carried out by my fulfillment vendors. I do mention this though because problems could arise in that timeframe that require my attention. I have verified that internet access will not be out of reach where we are staying, so I should be able to work productively while on this trip if required.\n\nI am prepared and motivated to meet any obstacles along the way, and diligently resolve them. My backers can count on honest and open communication from me about any such challenges.

Welcome to my first kickstarter!  While this may be my first time kickstarting I have had plenty of charms printed in the past, many of which can be seen at my etsy store and in the image below.  https://www.etsy.com/shop/KristinMadeStuff \nCharm Designs I've already had Made\nThe reason I'm turning to Kickstarter to fund this run of charms is pretty simple.  I've been selling art at conventions for many years and after some thought I've decided to make a big push to transition away from doing mostly fanart and focus on my own original designs.  This focus on original art makes the monetary investment to get a run of 10-20 new charm designs made much riskier for me, since original art can be a tougher sell.  I would like to offset production costs with this kickstarter so I can stock up my etsy store and go into my conventions next year with a big supply of awesome original artwork!\nTHE PLAN!\nMake these ten designs into 1.5 inch white backed acrylic charms!  Designs are as follows: Koi fish girl, Witch girl, Dragon Knight, Corgi, Tiger, Manatee, Owl, Legendary Pugasus, Battie, and Red Panda. \nThe Ten Designs!\nThe production plan is to make 20 charms of each of these 10 designs.  Actual charm numbers may vary once I find out which charms people want (if everyone wants bats I'm going to have to make more bats etc etc).  I'm planning to get these printed through Zap Creatives, which uses white acrylic to print, unlike the charms in my etsy store right now (which are on black acrylic).  you can see examples of their charms here http://www.zapcreatives.co.uk/p-32-15-custom-printed-acrylic-charms.aspx\nPhotoshop mock up of how the charms should look\nThe Options\nCharms can come with a variety of attachments, here's pictures of some of my current designs showing you the different options.\n!!NEW!! ADD ONS!!\nIf you're interested in adding on additional items to your pledge ($8 pledges and up) here's the breakdown of costs.  I will confirm with backers who pledge more than the pledge amount to see which add ons they wanted once the Kickstarter concludes.\nAdditional keychain or cell phone charm: add $5 \nAdditional set of Earrings: add $8\nAdditional Necklace: add $10\nAdditional Stickers: add $2 per sticker sheet\nAdditional Wooden Earrings: add $10 per pair.\nAdditional Wooden Keychain or Cell Phone Charm: add $6\nAdditional 5 Postcard Set: add $4\nCell Phone Lanyard\nKeychain\nEarrings (surgical steel hooks)\nNecklace (silver plated chain)\nBreakdown of expenses:\nCharm Production Costs: $344\nShipping: $30\nFindings (keychains etc): $50\nKickstarter expenses + other expenses: $76\nIt's pretty simple, really.  \nStretch goal #1 - 5 new designs: $850\n5 more designs will be made into charms!  Designs are: Gray Wolf, Cuddly Sloth, Nautical Squid, Fox, and Hungry Dragon.  All backers will be able to choose from all 15 charms and every backer over $8 will receive one 1.5inch pin of a random animal. \nThe 5 stretch designs!\nAll $8+ backers get one random button! Yay!\nRandom button designs will also include all kickstarter designs in addition to my older designs\nStretch goal #2 - stickers! : $1000\nAll backers who pledged $8 or more will receive two random buttons AND a 4inx4in sticker sheet of the koi fish girl.\nAll $8+ backers gets two random buttons! Yay!\nSakura Sticker sheet 4inx4in\nStretch Goal #3 - 5 MORE designs: $1300\n5 more charm designs to choose from!  Designs include Shark, Shiba, Lion, Ninja and the Scurvy Pirate Otter.  Look forward to seeing final art appear as we get closer to stretch goal #3!  All backers who pledged $8 or more still get the sticker sheet but now receive 3 random animal buttons instead of 2!\nThe Final Designs!\nAll $8+ backers get three random buttons!\nStretch Goal #4 - Spooky Stickers: $1500\nMore stickers!  All backers above $8 can choose between koi fish girl or witch stickers, backers over $21 get both sets.\nWitch Sticker Sheet\nStretch Goal #5 - Master of Lasers: $2000\nWooden charms!   Hitting the $2000 mark will fund the production of three different designs of wooden charms: updated cat, octopus and whale.  I'll be getting them produced at a local Boston business called Danger!Awesome.  Part of this stretch goal includes me being trained to use the lasers myself, essentially becoming a ~*~Master of Lasers~*~.  With the training I'll be able to produce charms at a lower cost and it will help with future projects!  If we reach this goal I'll be adding new tiers and add on options for wooden charms.  As they're wooden they're not as sturdy as the acrylic and I personally think they work better for earrings and necklaces than keychains.  But either option will be available.  \nPhotoshop Mockups of the Wooden Charms\nPrevious Charms I've Done\nStretch Goal 6: Postcards and Stickers -  $2500\nIf we reach $2500 it will fund the production of 5 different post card designs as well as several more sticker sheets: Dragon Knight and Ninja.  Each backer over $8 will receive one random postcard.  Backers over $8 will get to choose one of the sticker sheets, backers over $21 will get to choose two sheets, backers over $50 will get all four sheets.  Postcard Packs will be available as add on items.  \nNew Sticker Sheets!\nEach backer over $8 gets one random postcard!\nStretch Goal 7: 5 MORE designs! - $3000\nWhoa guys...whoa.  If we make it to $3000 there will be five more designs for backers to choose from!

But the rulers of the other nearby kingdoms have also learned of this new land, and they're gathering their troops for battle! Prepare for all-out war as you try to build bigger villages than your neighbors... no matter what it takes!\nVillages is a casual rummy-style card game with a competitive edge. The rules are simple--collect 3 or more cards of the same color and lay them down to build a village. Build bigger villages than everyone else to earn more gold!\nBut not everybody likes to play nice. If another player's village contains a card you'd like to have (or if you're just feeling mean!), you can fight them for it in a one-on-one duel. Each unit has its strengths and weaknesses, so a knowledge of each unit's unique abilities (and a little bit of luck) is crucial to winning the battle and taking home the prize.\nHow you decide to play is up to you, but one thing is clear: the only way to send your rivals packing is to be the first to earn 100 gold coins. Do you have what it takes to rule an empire?\nVillages supports 2 to 5 players and takes between 30 minutes and an hour to play.\n                                                                                                                                                           After playing a few hands of rummy with some friends one night, I got the idea to add a battle mechanic to make the game more interactive. The concept took off quickly from there, and it wasn't long until I had a completely new game on my hands.\nI released the first edition of Villages on The Game Crafter, an awesome print-on-demand site for board games and card game, back in November of 2011. It was a fun personal project and I didn't really expect to sell very many copies, but thought I'd take a chance and put it up for sale anyway.\nSince then, Villages has become one of the best-selling games on the site, and it was chosen as a Game Crafter staff pick in October of 2012. I've sold copies of Villages at two local conventions and I sold out both times. I've even been told by a grateful mother that my game was the only item on her son's Christmas wishlist after he played it at a birthday party. (That news gave me butterflies for a week.)\nJT, a founder of The Game Crafter, gave the game 5/5 stars and left this review:\nYou can read more reviews like this one at the Villages shop page on The Game Crafter.\nWorking on Villages has been a constant source of pleasant surprises and fun experiences. I still love playing it with the same group of friends who first helped me develop the idea. Honestly, I can't seem to get enough of it!\nAnd now, I want to run this Kickstarter campaign to share a new edition of the game with even more potential fans and give everyone a chance to try it out. I've taken everything I've learned about game design over the past few years and applied it to this brand new edition. It's more fair and more fun, and I think you'll enjoy it whether you've played a previous edition before or not.\nThanks for stopping by to check out Villages. I hope you like it as much as I do.\nWant to support Villages and get a copy of your own?

Expand your territory by exploring the new location deck, adding new rules and challenges to every game. Do you have what it takes to rule an empire?\nDistant Lands will contain about 40-45 cards.\n or +$2 for the PnP file only.\nGhost Town introduces the evil Dark cards, including such horrors as Zombies, Skeletons, and Vampires.

Only they know what kind of interesting cards this pack will contain... This pack is eligible for the Early Delivery option.\nKickstarter Exclusive.\nWhat are Power Dice? They are an optional component of Villages that adds a bit more luck and drama to each battle. Each time two units face off on the battlefield, each participating player rolls one of these dice and adds the value to their unit's power. These dice will be manufactured by Daft Concepts, who recently ran their own successful Daft Dice Kickstarter campaign.\nYou'll be able to choose black dice, red dice, or one of each. The numbers on the black dice are a bit safer (0-1-1-2-2-3), while the red dice have a wider range of results (0-0-1-1-3-4).\n+$5 shipping to Canada Builders (getting PnP files only)\n+$10 shipping to other International Builders (getting PnP files only)\nThese Kickstarter-exclusive Villages card sleeves will feature high-quality full color art on the back!

Upgrade to the Big Box with this add-on! See Update #19 for more information.\nNormally, the Big Box doesn't come with any of the individual Small Boxes inside of it, but this add-on will get you all of the Small Boxes for the base game and expansions! This add-on requires a Big Box first, meaning it's available to Wizards, Dragons, royalty, and Knights who also get the add-on directly above.\nSleeved cards won't fit in the Small Boxes, so be sure to remember this if you are also considering the Card Sleeves add-on!\n Each Archer bundle includes three (3) copies of Villages.\nEach Dragon bundle includes one (1) copy each of Villages, Distant Lands, Ghost Town, and the Holiday Pack, as well as a pair of Power Dice.\nThe base game is going to be ready earlier than the expansions, but shipping is very expensive, especially to countries outside the US. Because of this, if you order any expansions, your base game will be held until everything can go out in one package. But if you don't think you can wait that long, you can pay for the full price of the extra shipment and I will send you the base game (and Royalty Pack) as soon as it's ready, a full 2 months or so before the expansions are finished. If you did not order any expansions, you will get your game at the early date without the extra shipping costs. See Update #9 for more information.\nThe following items can be delivered early:\nVillages\nRoyalty Pack\nPower Dice\nCard Sleeves\nIf we go above and beyond our campaign goal, everyone who gets a copy of the game will also get some extra bonuses. These include the Super Villagers, special cards with extraordinary abilities. As more stretch goals are reached, more Super Villagers will join the fight. These cards may appear later as a paid mini-expansion for the rest of the world, but Kickstarter backers get them for free!\nThe King reward level also allows YOU to design your very own Super Villager and add him or her to every copy the game sent to backers as part of the Kickstarter campaign. Your card will take its place alongside any Super Villagers unlocked by these stretch goals!\nAnother type of stretch goal is Alternate Art. These are limited-edition upgrades to the card or packaging artwork, one piece at a time. Because each unit appears multiple times in the game, the Alternate Art will be used to replace duplicates.\nKickstarter Exclusive.\n Kickstarter Exclusive.\n Kickstarter Exclusive.\nCheck update #5 for more information.

Every card with multiple copies in the base game will get a second sprite.\nKickstarter Exclusive.\nEach expansion (Distant Lands, Ghost Town, and the Holiday Pack) will get a Super Villager! That's 3 Super Villagers in one stretch goal! Whaaat?!\nIf we hit this legendary stretch goal, I'll take 30 of the best cards created with the Cardsmith Kit, as voted on by the Villages community, and turn them into an official printed expansion! If you missed your chance to join the royalty during this campaign, why not try your hand at democracy? Even better, this expansion will come a few months after everyone's had a chance to become Villages experts, so you know it'll bring something fresh and polished to the table!\nThe final stretch goal. The goal to rule them all. Thank you for an amazing campaign, backers!\nFor those of you who have played Villages before, here's a detailed run-down on what's different about the new edition:\nImprovements were made to some of the unit sprites, the box art, and the backs of the cards. The new design of the card face also allows for longer names and more lines of ability text than before.\nTwo colors have been removed from the game: pink and brown. Having fewer colors means it's easier to build villages, it's more likely that another player will have a village you want to steal from, and cards like the Ace and Wizard become more exciting. All in all, it's just more fun.\nSome cards from the expansions are now part of the base game, including the Archer, Scout, Golem, Goblin, Merchant, Bunny, and Tavern. I felt that these cards added so much to the basic gameplay that I just couldn't leave them out of the core set. A few new cards will eventually fill the gaps they left behind.\nA few brand new units, the Joker and the Orc, have also found their way into the base game, while the Brute and Paladin have been removed.\nThe Breeder is now a Farmer. He does the same thing, though.\nMost units have had their base power or ability text tweaked to provide a wider range of power levels and simpler, more useful abilities.\nAttackers now win ties. But don't worry: the penalties for losing a battle are now a bit more lenient. If you attack someone and win, you now have to choose between sending the losing unit to the graveyard and stealing a card. If the defending player hired their defending unit, it will go to the graveyard anyway, but they can now guarantee that they will lose no more than 1 card during a battle by sending out a defending unit from their village. This helps weaker villages stay on the table longer and gives them a chance to turn the tide.\nThere are two special cards included with the game that help make the Hero and Goblin much easier to understand. The High Score and Low Score cards are handed out to the appropriate players at the end of each round, and the Hero and Goblin refer to the owners of these cards, rather than their score directly. This avoids the ambiguity around what it means to be in \"last place\" or what a player's \"total score\" is.\nThe game now includes a fancy full-color rule-book, full of diagrams and bullet points. There are also reference cards that outline the steps of a turn, the steps of battle, and how to score your villages at the end of the round.\nI have a few other game ideas in the works, not only for card games, but also for larger board games and even video games or mobile apps. I never quite know where my mind will take me next, but I know I'll definitely be working on something and sharing it with the world. I've never been happy doing otherwise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter project and the first of my games to be printed in bulk quantities.

We wanted to learn by doing \u2013 so that when it came time to make the kit and get it to your door, we wouldn't slip on a banana peel. \n(We also folded and packed the boxes in our apartment \u2013 but that was just for fun.)\nWhat's inside?\n1 \u2013 Kano Books, illustrated and intuitive\n2 \u2013 Kano OS and Levels on 8GB SD card\n3 \u2013 DIY Speaker\n4 \u2013 Raspberry Pi Model B\n5 \u2013 Kano Keyboard Combo\n6 \u2013 Custom case\n7 \u2013 Card mods and stencils\n8 \u2013 Stickers!\n9 \u2013 Cables: HDMI*, Mini-USB\n10 \u2013 Smart power plug (all region pins available)\n11 \u2013 WiFi powerup\nThe Kano box is light, recyclable, repackable, and fits through 85% of urban mailboxes.\nOur favorite pledges\nWe'd love to send you these rewards for supporting us, and there are even more at right.\nWhy?\n99% of the world is designed by and for a tech-literate 1%. That's a problem, caused by:\nClosed devices\nUn-fun, top-down teaching\nThe intimidation factor \u2013 \"geeks\" vs \"noobs\"\nWe often draw lines between things: art and science, code and design, STEM and the humanities. It makes \u201cdigital literacy\u201d seem like brussels sprouts \u2013 good for you, but hard to chew.\nIt shouldn't be so hard to get started \u2013 to make, play and experiment right out of the box.\nStart coding\nKano is a toolkit for anyone to start coding right away. \nWe think you learn faster and better when you have control and freedom, like in a good videogame. Then, when you can bend the rules, things get kung fu.\nWe love visual programming languages, especially Scratch, and wanted to hook them up to our favorite games. We came up with Kano Blocks, inspired by Google's Blockly and many hours of button-mashing. \nConnect blocks, output Python or Javascript, and see games change before your eyes, with live code updating. Make your own power-ups (two-player-mode, teleportation) then earn new ones. Huge Pong balls! Massive TNT towers! Code cheats, beat your friends.\nOur software combines Kano OS, a distribution of Debian Linux, with an interface that feels a bit like a console game. It runs six Kano Levels, software projects to make Pong, Snake, Minecraft, videos, and music \u2013 with (inshallah) more to come.\nWe're also loaded with Scratch, Codecademy, and \"Hacking Fundamentals,\" an introduction to the world of the Linux shell, where you can join the free software movement worldwide (and go on spy missions).\nSimple steps, fantastic projects \nA year ago, we started with a book \u2013 Lego-inspired, with a hint of our favorite manga. It's beautifully illustrated, instructional, with an achievement on every page. Our narrative (and name) is inspired by judo, and its creator, Kano Jigoro, a lifelong schoolteacher.\nIn the Bronx or Beijing \nKano is for everyone, so you can get our books in English, Spanish, Arabic, or Mandarin, and we're working on more languages. We deliver around the world with flat shipping costs. (See rewards at right.)\nWe'd love to make you a $99 kit. But any pledge, any size, will go toward building the first computer made by and for the majority world, and end-to-end with open source software.\nPlug and play your own way \nWe designed the Kano Kit to be a bit like our favorite boardgames growing up. It's vibrant, repackable, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Trick out your computer with stickers, decals, and your own designs. Or turn your computer into a mini-boombox with a D.I.Y. speaker, powered by an amp and the Pi's own GPIO pins.\nAt school and at work\nMake Kano with your cousin, your Dad, your friends, or your dog. (Caution: do not put stickers on dog.) The kit is also great for schools, clubs, companies, and places where people ponder. It introduces computing and code in simple, tactile ways.\nMake hardware\nHack games\nShare projects\nOnboard Scratch, Codecademy, Minecraft, and more\nKano provides pedagogy, exercises, and tools for each key stage rubric in the new UK computing curriculum \u2013 it's great for small groups (a semester project) or a take-home project.\nGet the projects and books\nWe want to get our content and software into your hands as soon as we can. Support us with more than $9, and you'll be an Alpha hero \u2013 you'll get early downloads of our books and software before our full release. $9 is a great pledge for anyone who has a Pi in their drawer and wants a cool way to get started (or teach it!).\n(Pledge more than $19, and we'll send you a t-shirt and stickers too!)\nSupport computer kits for kids\nKano Academy is our not-for-profit project. Through it, we're working to get low-cost, homebrew tech into the hands of smart young people woldwide. We need your help to keep it going. So far, we:\nSupported a scholarship for the 16-year-old inventor Kelvin Doe \u2013 Freetown, Sierra Leon\nSupported the Caine's Arcade scholarship fund in Los Angeles, USA\nSponsored the Learning Inventions team to workshop RPi robotics with fifty kids in Chiang Mai, Thailand \nThirty gratis 'make a computer' workshops in Primary & Secondary Schools around the UK\nCommitted to sponsor Kano kits to Martha Chumo, who's setting up a non-profit Dev School in Nairobi, Kenya \nCommitted to donate 25 Kano kits to a new Innovation Lab in Freetown, Sierra Leon\nSponsored the first Codemakers camp in Newcastle, UK\nSupported the Internet Archive to rebuild its fire-damaged scanning center in San Francisco, CA\nWe want to get kits to those who have been excluded \u2013 by economics or geography. Your pledge helps us make it possible. \nPledge $229, get a kit for yourself, and give one to a kid\nIf you want a kit and you're feeling the holiday warmth, consider pledging on behalf of a smart kid who can't afford one. Just email us at rewards@kano.me to let us know you want to Give-One-Get-One, and we'll pledge the kit in your name, to whomever you want, after the campaign.\nOr, if you're feeling extra magnanimous, you can bump up to a Kano Lab pledge. You'll utterly transform a classroom, makespace, or institution with DIY computers and a hands-on introduction from us. (Details at right.) Oh and you get a Kano kit too which is sweet.\nProudly Pi\nWe love building on top of the Raspberry Pi board, and alongside the foundation and community. We're working open up the device's promise and power to everyone, and expand the ecosystem. \nWe've designed brand new hardware and new hacks, and fixed dozens of known issues on the Pi \u2013 they'll be open, so anyone can have at them and improve. \nWho are you people?\nWe're a group of eight from six different countries. We've been around for a year now, making things we think are cool and shipping kits around the world. \nIf we were a collective animal, it would be an octopus.\npizza, beer, sidewalk, kano\nThe Challenge\nLast November, Alex, Yonatan, and Saul were trying to imagine what a computer for the next generation would look like. \nthe aforementioned\nIn the end, it came down to a challenge from Micah, a smart seven-year-old \u2013 Saul's boychik, Alex's cousin.\nMicah wanted to make his own computer. But he had two rules:\nIt had to be as simple and fun \"as Lego.\"\nNo one \"teaches me\" how to do it (zzz)\nSaul introduced Yonatan (who loves big challenges) to Alex (who likes beautiful things and good stories.)\nThen this happened (*whooosh flashback*)\nHey Kickstarter!\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year making, playing, and remaking the kit around the world with \nhundreds of young people\ntech educators\nmusicians\nteachers\ngamers\nand the open-source community. \nThe prototype works beautifully, we\u2019ve nailed suppliers and production, and we know we can make it at $99 \u2013 so it can reach everyone. \nBut we need your help to make it happen\nWe always knew that Kano was something we wanted to take directly to Kickstarter for a first run. It's a place that blurs those lines from earlier \u2013 art, science, etc. \u2013 and thus can make really audacious dreams come true. \n$100,000 will allow us to make up to 1000 more kits, keep the lights on, and work on new hardware expansions. With your help, we can continue to make \"making\" even more accessible and fun.\nA bonus!\nKickstarter backers will be the first to get the new Kano Kit, and also to play with the new Kano OS as treasured Alpha testers. \nPlus, just for here, we're offering the Kano keyboard as a separate accessory \u2013 wireless, independent mouse buttons, multitouch trackpad, awesome, orange. Just pledge more than $49 to get it.\n(Smaller than a Subway sandwich.)\nEverything is a prototype\nWe want to keep designing projects, books, software levels, hardware, and experiences that you want \u2013 then releasing and open-sourcing them as soon as they're working. It's messy but fun, and keeps us thinking.\nEarly book sketch (boom!)\nEarly case rapid prototype\nKit starts to take shape\nIt fits!\nOrigin of species\nProduction timeline\nPledge promise\nBefore Kickstarting, we wanted to ensure we could make good on our promises. So we started early \u2013 we designed, developed and released 200 prototype kits (white box), and brought them to market. \nA year later, we\u2019ve sourced hundreds of components from dozens of suppliers, completed product assembly and order fulfillment ourselves (at first from Yonatan and Alex\u2019s apartment), and pulled off operations for our early adopters. If you join us with a pledge, we'll be able to go the last mile.\nIt\u2019s been an adventure, and we\u2019re ready for larger volumes and new expansions. Our prototypes are up, running, and ready for next summer \u2013 all we need is you.\nWe hope we can get you started with Kano.

We've also built on top of the work of fine Pi hackers like Sam Aaron, Rich Wareham, and Alex Bradbury, and are pushing all our own code back into the community. We are also grateful for the Debian community, who have been huge assets as we try and create a new generation of open-source engineers and creators by making Linux fun. We're also grateful to Mojang for Minecraft and the Pi Edition. \nFor the new hardware and packaging, we worked with the geniuses at MAP, industrial designers who make mindblowing classroom chairs and watering cans. They've pioneered a process called \"informed creativity\" and were founded by the guys who did the London Olympic Torch. We collaborated with Jon Marshall, Scott Barwick, and Jacky Chung, mould-breaking thinkers and artists.\nWe started this a year ago with the thought that anyone should be able to make and change technology. We're just one group of people working in a broader movement to bring technological creativity to the masses (Codecademy, Code.org, Raspberry Pi). Hope you can be, like us, a small part.\nSome things we're glad people said\n\"There's enormous value to platforms like Kano which add hardware, software, peripherals and documentation to the Pi to make it more appealing to users who are under-served by the standard offering. I've had a play with early versions of the Kano software environment, and I think Alex and the team are doing great work making the Pi more accessible to younger and less technical audiences.\"\n-Eben Upton, Founder, CEO, Inventor, Raspberry Pi\n\"The Kano Kit was really inspirational to young people in Freetown.\" -Kelvin Doe, inventor, aka \"DJ Focus,\"\n\u201cAdults think we're incapable, but we made a computer with this like, Matrix code.

Where did the idea come from? Well, My wife, Gal and I, like most people today, are dependent on our smart phones but both are very aware of the dangers of driving while being on our phones. Gal surprised me one day and got me a phone mount for our car so that my phone would stay in place and be visible to me while I drive. However, as an industrial designer it is important to me that the gadgets I own are not only easy to use and versatile, but look good too. The phone mount she got me was bulky and difficult to set up, plus, once I got out of my car and went to where I had to go I was left with no mount for my phone.\nAfter doing some research on phone mounts that exist in today's market, I found that they were not easy to use, and lacked in design. Also, none of them gave you the option of easily taking them out of your car and traveling with you from place to place so that you will always have somewhere to mount your phone.\nSo we try to think of a solution for a phone mount that is simple and can travel with you everywhere you go.\nWe have spent the past 7 month developing, designing, and testing many different prototypes of Sticko. Testing out different materials, different sizes and different designs until we found the perfect combination so that Sticko will be simple, strong and look cool in all its uses, especially when connected to your smart phone.   \nBrain storming\nFinally, Sticko was born! A gadget that is small in size but big in its benefits:\nPLAY\n\nSticko colors\nSticko can attach to any smooth surface and is flexible due to the suction cup material its made out of. Its flexibility allows for Sticko to attach to smooth surfaces that are not necessarily flat. Sticko is made out of a special u.v protected and heatproof material so it will stay strong even in the harshest conditions like a hot car in the middle of summer. It weighs less than 5 grams and is less than 14 millimeters high.\nIt comes with a lobster clamp and earphone jack attached to it. You can attach it to your phone using the earphone jack or your key chain with the lobster clamp. Its size and flexibility allows you to slip it in your back pocket attached to your phone/or key chain.\nAttach Sticko to your keys\nUse Sticko as a phone stand\nSince we made Sticko we both are addicted to it, we have ours attached to our phones and key chains so our Sticko's are constantly in use. The more we use Sticko the more uses we find for it that go way beyond just mounting your smartphone. Every person who saw Sticko added their own twist on uses they thought fit for the little gadget. That's when we realized that people were as amazed and excited about Sticko as we were.\nUse Sticko as a Glasses Holder\nSoon enough our friends and family were asking us for a Sticko of their own. We ordered a small injection mold allowing us to test the final product, and, to give Sticko\u2019s to our friends and family and get their feedback.\nSo Where Do We Stand Now?\nThe Sticko's that came back from the injection mold came out perfect, and the feedback we received from those who got to use Sticko was overwhelmingly positive. So we wanted to make them on a larger scale so more people can enjoy Sticko. And that's what brought us to you, to Kickstarter.\nWhats Next?\nWith the funds we raise we will be able to invest in a larger production line so that we can share Sticko with you and anyone else who believes in this gadget. We have the final CAD technical drawings of Sticko that we can take to any manufacturer, but since we have already verified the quality and accuracy of the particular manufacturer who built the prototypes , we plan on having Sticko produced by them. They can accommodate small production quantity as well as very large mass production requirements. Once we finish our Kickstarter campaign, we will know exactly how many Sticko's we will need to produce. We will personally inspect each Sticko to make sure it is up to our highest standards. After they pass our quality control we will pack them securely and prepare for shipment. We already have business account with one of the most trusted shipping companies in the U.S. so we will ship Sticko to you A.S.A.P. Sticko will be FREE OF SHIPPING CHARGES anywhere within the U.S.\nWe are asking for your support so we can share the Sticko lifestyle with you and all your friends and all their friends, you get the point. Your help will allow us to build up a production line. That way we will be able to produce more Sticko's for every gadget that needs mounting.\nThanks for your support!\nOh one more thing, after you get a Sticko, send us pictures of cool and unique uses you think that we would love, so we can share them on Sticko's website and create a real Sticko community.\n Love, \n          Gal&Boaz\nCan I help in other ways? \nYes!

Its been over half a year of designing and testing Sticko but we wanted to make sure that Sticko is complete with rigorous performance and durability tests before we launch our Sticko in Kickstarter. Once we got the parts we assembled them by hand and gave it to more than 50 different users to test Sticko in different environments. The feedback we received gave us a lot of confidence that Sticko was ready. \nWe're very confident that we will deliver our products in superior quality by the projected dates.\n\nMANUFACTURING \nWe already have established a working relationship with a reliable plastic injection manufacturer and a mold maker, and an experienced contractor to mitigate the risk of delays by material suppliers and to ensure that quality control is implemented to the highest level. We have built test prototypes with our manufacturer and they fully understand our product, specifications and production timeline. While we know there can be unexpected challenges along the way.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

See our \"Tiers and Options\" section below for details and photos of any pledge tier!\nWho We Are\nWyrmwood Gaming is a small company run out of a single workshop in East Taunton, Massachusetts. It consists of two longtime friends, Douglas Costello & Edward Maranville. We founded the company on a simple idea--that gamers appreciate, and deserve, fine craftsmanship.\nWe've already created and produced two product lines: Dice Trays, for tabletop gamers of all kinds, and our Deck Boxes for collectible card game players (we've included photos in the \"Product Line\" section).\nBut Wyrmwood Gaming needs you to help us launch the Dice Vault--the first-ever premium, handmade dice case! The Dice Vault, made of high quality hardwoods, is the only product of its kind and was created to give tabletop gamers a high-end way to showcase and store their favorite set of RPG dice.\nPresenting the Wyrmwood Gaming Dice Vault!\nThe Dice Vault is designed with players of all tabletop RPGs in mind: Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, Vampire: The Masquerade, Pathfinder, and many more!\nThe Dice Vault in Douglas Fir\nThe Dice Vault in Wenge\nThe Wyrmwood Gaming Dice Vault\nThe case features sturdy, all-wood construction, with strong magnets installed so it will remain securely closed (as well as give an oh-so-satisfying snap when you shut it). It's painstakingly sanded and finished, and comes in two sizes to fit the needs of tabletop gamers everywhere. The Standard case holds a set an RPG set of seven polyhedral dice, the set used by D&D, Pathfinder and others, while the Expanded size will fit a set of ten 10-sided dice (d10), as required by White Wolf's World of Darkness games, like Vampire and Mage.\nThe Expanded Dice Vault in Rosewood\nThe Expanded size can also be used to hold a standard RPG set of 7 dice, with extra six-sided dice.\nExpanded Dice Vault in Rosewood, RPG dice set with extra d6s\nThe Process\nThe process for creating the Dice Vault is quite involved, and could easily fill this page; if you're hungry for information, you can check out our Facebook page. We've posted a photo album called \"The Process\" which details the creation of this product, leading up to the Kickstarter launch! Here's just a sample of what you'll find there:\nTiers and Options\nThe Dice Vault is available in 12 different wood species, two of which are new to us and are currently available only through this Kickstarter campaign! We've also got more wood species available via stretch goals. We're offering the Dice Vault at a variety of price points befitting the rarity and cost of the woods involved, and have separated the species into tiers with others of similar value. Here's our offerings at launch, broken down into their respective tiers. You'll see we've chosen sets of dice that complement each wood species: to add dice to your pledge, see our Add-Ons section.\nThe vault in White Oak and Red Oak (Kickstarter Exclusive).\nRed Oak with Shell Dice set, White Oak with Copper/Green dice set.\n(Left to right:) Cherry with Red/Purple dice set, Douglas Fir with Shell dice set, Walnut with Gold/White dice set, Maple with blue/black dice set.\nThe vault in Bubinga, Zebrawood, Wenge, Purpleheart (Kickstarter Exclusive!) and Mahogany.\n(Left to right:) Bubinga with Shell dice set, Zebrawood with Copper/Green dice set, Wenge with Red/Purple dice set, Purpleheart with Mother of Pearl dice set, Mahogany with Blue/Black dice set.\nRosewood vault with Mother of Pearl dice set.\nBeyond the solid woods, we offer the PARAGON Tier -- choose from five combinations of woods with a contrasting veneer attached!\n Note: Ebony/Rare Woods excluded from the Epic Tier.\nAbove the Paragon Tier, we have the Epic Tier and Legend Tier. These Dice Vaults include a Celtic knot pattern carved into the top of the case. At the Epic Tier, choose from any solid wood (excluding Ebony and Rare Wood tiers); at Legend, choose from any of the Paragon Tier combinations.\nFor the Deity Tier, we bring you Gabon Ebony! Ebony is a remarkable wood, one we always dreamed of offering. We're extremely pleased to be able to use it for the first time with the Dice Vault!\nFor the most elite gamers we offer the Dungeon Master Tier: a Dice Vault with handcrafted veneer inlays of multiple species of wood, painstakingly arranged in a striking Celtic pattern. A true work of art, due to the intensive nature of the handwork involved a very limited number are available.\nMahagony vault with handworked marquetry top.\nWenge and Walnut vault with handworked marquetry top.\nFinally, beyond the Dungeon Master, for those that must have something completely original, completely their own, we present the Gygax Tier.\nSimilar in concept to the Dungeon Master Tier, the Gygax will feature hand marquetry. However, by pledging at Gygax, you are commissioning a completely custom work from Wyrmwood Gaming. We will be in direct contact with you to determine the details of your artwork and materials; fine woods such as Holly, Ebony and Rosewood are of course available, but non-ferrous metals like silver and brass are also possibilities, as are Ivory and other materials. Your pledge is best considered an estimate; costs can increase based on some chosen materials (gold, platinum, etc.).\nThis will absolutely not be ready for the holidays! It will take significant time to flesh out the concept to your specifications, which will begin after the Kickstarter run of product has been produced and shipped, and we can devote the required attention and time to custom work.\nIf you are considering pledging at this level, feel free to contact us with any questions, or a rough idea of your proposal, prior to pledging!\nRare Wood Tiers\nThese tiers have been unlocked by our backers through stretch goals. These are all prized exotic woods, with strictly limited holiday delivery spots. These Dice Vaults can be purchased as add-ons, but only those pledging at the Rare Wood tiers will get them for Christmas 2013! All others will ship for February 2014. Please see our FAQ for details!\nA unique variant on Tamarind, its recognizable, dramatic appearance makes it highly prized! We're thrilled to be able to offer it to our backers in limited quantities!\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nEbony is known for being black, but there are many species of ebony, and Black and White Ebony is among the most striking. For a more \"classical\" form of Ebony, see Gabon Ebony, above in the Deity Tier!\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nLignum Vitae is one of the densest, toughest woods in existence, one of the \"ironwoods.\" We didn't have it in mind when we conceived the Dice Vault, but If there's one wood appropriate to the name, it's Lignum Vitae.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nSimilar to appearance to rosewood, this tropical wood is hard and dense. It's beauty is evident, but it has a long history of use in fine inlay work, furniture, and smaller decorative applications.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nA striking, tropical variant of Walnut, also known as Tropical Walnut. Despite not coming strictly from Peru, this is the most common name.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nThis striking Mahogany variant is highly sought after for it's flowing figuring patterns, the cascading appearance of which give it its name.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nThis wood is renowned for its distinctive, beautiful grain patterns, known as spider-webbing or, alternatively, landscaping, so-called for the appearance of valleys and hills in the grain.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nVariable in color from red to reddish-brown or purple-brown, this strong, tropical wood is known by various names. It's used in fine furniture, musical instruments, and various decorative applications.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nThis rather rare wood is generally not available in large quantities. It's traditionally used for ornamental work and inlays, due to its pure, nearly white appearance.\nHoliday Delivery Status: Available!\nAnother very unusual wood, as you can tell from its amazing hue, Pink Ivory was at one time only possessed by the Zulu royal family. A legend was spread that anyone else possessing this wood would be subject to punishment by death... but since the wood has since spread around the world, we think they were bluffing. ;)\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nAn important wood in its native Brazil, Yellowheart is notable primarily for its striking yellow coloring, as one might expect after having seen the similarly named Purpleheart! Yellowheart earns its name by approaching striking shades not normally associated with natural wood - if you imagine the shade of a banana, you aren't far off!\nHoliday Delivery Status: Available!\nA popular wood often used to repel moths, due to its distinctive fragrance; nevertheless, a visually striking species, often with pinkish to reddish-brown hues and very straight grain. Sometimes used to make longbows.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nA very sustainable and ecologically friendly material, Bamboo composite has the added benefit of being very strong and visually remarkable. Of course, it's also achieved a degree of fame due to its long association with Asian culture.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nDue to the importance of olive trees economically, Olivewood is rarely seen as lumber. A striking wood that tends to darken with age, it usually appears cream or yellowish in color, with contrasting darker streaks.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nThe ancient, massive Kauri trees of New Zealand were suddenly and violently buried in swamps tens of thousands of years ago. The timber survived, and trees that have fallen are extracted for lumber through an arduous procedure; this makes the lumber expensive and rare, but to own a piece of Ancient Kauri is to hold prehistory, and as such it's highly sought after.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nBlack Palm trees are unusual for a variety of reasons. Unlike most trees, the core of the tree is soft, while the outer portions produce this wood. Like Bamboo, it consists of densely packed fibers, and is not technically a hardwood or softwood. It has been used for canes, knife handles, martial arts weapons, flooring and fine furniture accents.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nJoining Purpleheart and Yellowheart, Redheart also takes its name from its vibrant coloring. When first cut, it will often exhibit a bright red shade, deepening to a rich brownish red with time.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nIn addition to having its warm coloring, Osage Orange is a very dense, seasonally stable and hardy wood; it's prized in demanding applications where such rugged qualities are required. An excellent choice for making bows, the wood also contains a natural yellow-orange dye.\nHoliday Delivery Status: Available!\nThe relatively wide variety of colors within Canarywood means pieces can have a rainbow-like effect, with multiple grain lines of varying shades stacked on top of one another. Said to have desirable acoustic properties, Canarywood can be found in musical instruments and speaker enclosures.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nPrimarily a golden brown, Marblewood derives its name from its pattern of contrasting, irregular streaks of brown, purple or black. A rather dense, durable wood, it tends to have a finer texture and more variation in its \"stripes\" then the more readily available Zebrawood.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nAn often highly figured variant of Walnut, this rich brown wood is found primarily in California Walnut orchards. As lumber, it can be found in small quantities, used for fine furniture, musical instruments, gunstocks and small items.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nWhile Tiger Maple, also known as Flame Maple, features a striped figuring pattern, Quilted Maple features a breathtaking pattern of waves or ripples. Quilted Maple can be very highly sought after; heavily quilted Maple can be seen on the surface of many fine instruments, especially electric guitars.\nHoliday Delivery Status: Available!\nFeaturing striking, high contrast bands of color, this Mexican wood is never less than eye-catching. Not limited to stripes, its grain can feature swirls, sometimes called \"eyes,\" which make an already beautiful wood even more unique. Bocote is a favorite for its aesthetic properties.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nSometimes called Vermillion, Padauk begins as shades of pinkish orange which deepen over time to a vivid reddish brown. Popular due to its coloring and toughness, Padauk is often imported and remains more available than many other exotic woods. It can be found in chess sets and many other decorative applications.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nTypically reddish-brown in color and oftentimes featuring figuring, Koa is naturally abundant in Hawaii, where it's regarded as the most beautiful of Hawaii's hardwoods. Many Koa forests have been cleared, so lumber is somewhat rare, but it can nonetheless be found in many specialty items like fine guitars. Koa is usually the wood of choice for ukuleles due its acoustic properties and its place of origin.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nThough it cannot match the pure black of Gabon Ebony, African Blackwood was imported and used in Ancient Egypt thousands of years ago, and is sometimes called the original ebony. The hard, dense lumber is rare and highly sought after as trees grow slowly, and tend to be small. It's used in fine furniture, and musical instruments ranging from guitars and banjos to clarinets, oboes and other woodwinds.\nHoliday Delivery Status: SOLD OUT!\nThe Wyrmwood Gaming Product Line\nHere are a few photos of some of Wyrmwood Gaming's other products, so you can get an idea of the quality we deliver:\nAFFINITY Series and LOTUS Series Deck Boxes\nLOTUS Series Dice Trays\nIf you'd like to see more, or place an order, you can do so at wyrmwoodgaming.com.

Move Quick! The other Ninjas are also rolling dice to attack you, and each other, because the Ninja with the most treasure wins!\nNinja Dice introduces a mechanic that allows certain dice to modify other dice based on how they land. Dice that have a line on their front edge can modify other dice partially or completely in front of them, like an arc of fire.\nIn the example above, any die that is partially or completely in the orange area can be targeted by the Fortune die.\nNinja Dice is also different because every time the active player rolls the other players roll against them. If the active player re-rolls, so do the other players. \nUnlike many dice games Ninja Dice is not a multi-player game of solitaire!\n\u201cReally great game concept\u201d -Noobsource  (\"The GenCon Experience\")\n\"It succeeds at taking a different angle to press your luck games, and it does it in a way that\u2019s innovative, entertaining, and brief.\" - The Cardboard Republic (Previewing: Ninja Dice)\n\"Push your luck with arc of fire, I'm going to guarantee that that\u2019s pretty original!\" - TheSpiel podcast (from GenCon 2013)\n\"I love the fact that there's player interaction!\" - Bower's Game Corner (Ninja Dice review)\n\"Really impressed that they did something different with this\" - Undead Viking (Ninja Dice review)\n\"Nice, light, little fun game\"- MarcoWargamer (Marco's Board Game Video Reviews)\n\"Even when it's not your turn you're doing something to hinder your opponent\" - GeekStorm Episode 15 (Kickstarter Spotlight segment)\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cute little game\u201d - MisDirectedMark podcast (Episode 76)\nNinja Dice on BoardGameGeek.com\nGreenbrier Games Facebook page\nTwitter - @GreenBrierGames\nFirst, roll the House dice to see what challenges you must overcome. Then roll your Skill dice and match up your Ninja skills against these challenges. At the same time, the other players will be rolling Threat dice to try and stop you.\nYou earn treasure at the end of your turn for the challenges you beat, and if you beat all the challenges of a house you gain bonus treasure. You also get extra treasure if you pass all challenges without having to fight anyone, so be as stealthy as you can.\nIf you don't roll the skills needed to beat all the house challenges you can stop and take the treasure you've earned so far, or you can re-roll any of your skill dice. But each time you re-roll the other players get to roll threat dice to see if your time runs out. If time runs out your turn is over and you get no treasure!\nThe threat dice also allow the other players to attack and possibly take treasure from you, or from each other, every time you roll.\nThe player with the most treasure after three rounds of increasingly difficult challenges wins the game. \nFour player games play in 15-25 minutes; five player games play in 25-35 minutes.\nYou can see the rules here: Ninja Dice Rules\nNinja Dice comes with 15 compression molded \"etched\" dice: 6 House dice, 5 Skill dice, and 4 Threat dice.

Block lets you stop arrow attacks if other players try and take your treasure.\nThe Threat dice represent time passing as you try to beat the house challenges:\nA total of four hourglasses rolled during your turn means your turn is over and you gain no treasure. The Arrow gives the other players a chance to attack you, or attack each other, and take treasure. Block protects the player that rolled it from arrow attacks.\nThanks to all the backers out there the base game will now come with plastic treasure tokens! They come in three types: copper, silver and gold, and represent 1, 5 and 10 treasure respectively. Here are 3D Renders of the plastic tokens:\nThese will be great tokens and a significant upgrade from the originally planned cardboard tokens but we may even have a metal option as an add-on (-- see the Stretch Goals section above)\n\"But Ninjas didn't care about treasure!\" you exclaim. Ah, but historically Ninjas were often mercenaries and actually did enjoy their treasure. (Wiki it, after you pledge! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja )\n  The base game of Ninja Dice comes in a rugged, take-anywhere, zippered fabric Ninja container with 6 House dice, 5 Skill dice, 4 Threat dice, 21 \"copper\" treasure tokens, 7 \"silver\" treasure tokens, 7 \"gold\" treasure tokens and a double-sided rules sheet. \nDue to the wonderful support of all our backers we have unlocked some additional content that will not be included in the retail package but all of you Kickstarter backers will recieve. So far this includes 4 Exclusive Location Cards, the Location Card Pack #1 which would normally be a seperate purchase, and 2 Zpocalypse promo cards.\nIf we get enough backers we'll package the fabric Ninja Dice container inside a collectible \"hide-in-plain-sight\" box for Kickstarter backers only  -- see the Stretch Goals section above.\nNote: you'll still get the game in it's normal black fabric Ninja container, but we'll put it inside a special box with cut-outs for his eyes and headband.\nGreenbrier Games has run two successful Kickstarter campaigns, but we are still just a bunch of average folks working day jobs while playing and creating board games in our spare time.\nZpocalypse, our first Kickstarter campaign, held the brief title of top grossing board game project in history until the awesome Steve Jackson re-released OGRE and overran us! Our Aftermath project also did very well. Thanks again to all of our supporters; you made these projects happen!\nBut we are still just normal folks trying to break even while making our dreams come true.\nThe bottom line is Ninja Dice will not be published unless this campaign is successful. \nWe think this is an amazingly fun game, but we don't have a treasure chest of money to publish it without your help. That's why we've once again turned to Kickstarter, and to you, to help make this awesome little game a reality!\nStretch goals have become a popular way to give better components and other unique items to backers of Kickstarter projects if the money raised is above the project's goal. We have set our target goal at the absolute minimum amount we need to publish Ninja Dice, but we would love to publish it with better components like plastic treasure tokens instead of cardboard ones and threat dice inked with different colors. \nWith your help we can raise enough money to enhance what comes with all copies of Ninja Dice and provide special add-ons. \nWhere are the Minis?\nGreenbrier Games is teaming up with Fairytale Games to breath life to an exciting new set of miniatures.  Fairytale Games: The Battle Royale, a survival tabletop card game, where fairytale/folklore heroes and villains are pitted against each other in a Hunger Games (or Battle Royale) style death match. \nThey have a new Kickstarter running right now for some great miniatures set in the universe they have created. Jed, from Greenbrier Games, is the lead modeler in making these miniatures come to life! So go check out their Kickstarter!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter project. Our first project started with cardboard and ended up with custom miniatures, cards, dice and expansion packs and we've learned the ins and outs of nearly every facet of the board game manufacturing world. We've learned (painfully!) how to set realistic goals for both ourselves and our backers, hopefully making the process rewarding for everyone involved.\n\nAs with any project produced overseas, there can be unforeseen production delays, shipping delays and customs delays. We've learned (again painfully!) all about delays and ways to manage or avoid them.\n\nWe're working with the same manufacturer that printed our first two projects, Grand Prix International. They've made custom dice for us before and the results are top-notch. We've already got all art and game design ready. We've even received a few prototypes from the manufacturers and have started the back and forth proofing process. \n\nWe've also learned to be realistic in the extra time needed for any extra content that may be added with our stretch goals, and we've padded our delivery date to account for any unforeseen production delays.

Or did you used to play tabletop minis games and had to stop because of your busy schedule? Or maybe you play all the time and want a way to get your friends or family members into miniatures gaming too. Well, these are some of the reasons why we're creating Golem Arcana - the digitally-enhanced miniatures game. \nThe key to Golem Arcana\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Bluetooth-enabled Tabletop Digital Interface Stylus (TDI). The stylus sends the tabletop game information to your touchscreen phone or tablet, making record-keeping automatic. Important game information is all quickly searchable at your fingertips. Plus, all Golem Arcana figures come fully assembled and painted* so you can start playing right out of the box. \n*If you want to paint your own figures, then check out the unpainted resin figures in the Optional Items Menu down the page.\nHere are the highlights of a live Grudge Match between two of our engineers. Check it out to see which one lost his beard!  \nThe Golem Arcana Base Game, along with your smartphone or tablet, provides everything you need for a great, fast-playing, two-player skirmish. From there, you can EXPAND Golem Arcana to field larger armies of Golems, create larger battlefields, and play with up to eight players.\nGolem Foundry, by Kekai Kotaki\nGolems are giant magical constructs of branch, bone, and stone which are mastered in battle by combat Mages called Golem Knights and the royal Blood Knights. \nGolems are crafted in four size classes: War Sprite, Ogre, Titan, and Colossus.\nThe world of Golem Arcana was sculpted by the Ancient Ones, who crafted the Golems. While much of their magical knowledge has been lost in the millennia since they ascended, the crafting of Golems is still possible, governed by the few remaining magical Codexes they left behind.\nRegardless of the Reward Tier you select, all of these Golem figures are also available for purchase on the Optional Items Menu. \nGolem Arcana is balanced by players agreeing upon a point value for the armies they field. Each unit in the game (Golems, Knights, and Ancient Ones) is worth a set amount of army points, so you select the ones you want, add up their value and start playing, And don\u2019t worry about making a mistake - the App does all the math.\nThere are three types of characters used in Golem Arcana armies: Golems, Knights, and Ancient Ones. They represent three layers of gameplay you can combine to customize your army and create new strategies.\nWar Council, by Kekai Kotaki\nGolems, represented by the pre-painted miniatures on the game board. \nGolems are ridden into combat by mighty Golem Knights, who are represented digitally in the Golem Arcana App. Each Golem Knight has a powerful special ability that augments the Golem's - and sometimes the whole army. Part of your strategy in designing a Golem Arcana army is to pair specific Golem Knights with specific Golems to create a beneficial combination of abilities.\nExtraordinary Golem Knights, known as Blood Knights, are the direct descendants of the Ancient Ones. Due to their celestial bloodline, and in addition to their special ability, Blood Knights may also channel the magical energy of the Earth - called Mana - to an Ancient One ancestor. In exchange for Mana, the Ancient One will bestow Miracles, Blessings, and Curses to Blood Knight descendants to aid them on the battlefield. Both Blood Knights and Ancient Ones are represented digitally in the Golem Arcana App.\nHamazi Maelstrom, by Kekai Kotaki\n\u201cBlood, Bloodlines, and Golems are the materials from which history is built.\u201d \n- Jauti Ishtimesh, Learned Master of the University of Ur\nThe setting for Golem Arcana begins after the meteoric rise and fall of the Great Khan. In the ensuing chaos, conquered tribes and clans rise up to reclaim their sovereignty, neighboring empires mobilize to reclaim lost territory and honor, all as the heirs of the Khan battle each other for control of the Uruk Dominion. \nThe Empires, Tribes, and Clans of Golem Arcana are led by powerful Blood Knights whose ancestry determines which codexes of Golems are fielded in their armies.  \nThe World of Eretsu is filled with stories both ancient and new. Yet Golems do not create history. That is the sole purview of people, as you will see in these short Tales of Eretsu.\nLORE: THE DARK WITCH \nLORE: TOOLS\nNadanna inherited her father's warrior heart and fiery crown, but she desires control of his entire Dominion and will happily kill her half brothers and sisters to secure it.\nA powerful and proven warrior-mage whose bloodlines trace back to the Urugal and Gudanna Ancient Ones, Raga (Princess) Nandanna has already drawn several of the Empire\u2019s key regiments to herself. She has mobilized them in her efforts to protect the Dominion and to eliminate any rivals for its throne. Jahnu, Great Khan, fathered over 100 children by almost as many wives, but left behind only 4 wives and 27 children - 26 of which Nandanna will need to cow or destroy in order for her to occupy her father\u2019s Saddle Throne.\nRead more about the Crown of Uruk in these short tales.\nLORE: CHILDS-PLAY\nLORE: NEGOTIATIONS\nPrincess Dasra mobilizes her Golem regiments to seek revenge on The Great Khan by retaking her lands and destroying his heirs in the process.\nThe thousand-year-old Hamazi Empire\u2019s prosperous northern region is ruled by the Raga Dasra, great-granddaughter of His Highness the Supreme Emperor. Dasra stings from humiliation at having to pay tribute to the Great Khan after the defeats she suffered from the armies of the Lower Empire and seeks to right the scales by capitalizing on the collapse of his Dominion. As sinuous and cold blooded as the snake of her family crest, she carefully calculates every move in her secret campaign to capitalize on the collapse of his Dominion and assume the Empire\u2019s Gilded Throne.\nRead more about the the Upper Hamazi Empire in this short tale.\nLORE: THE VIPER PRINCESS\nPrince, outcast, mercenary, and now as the last of his bloodline, Vanya leads the remains of his tribe against the Empire that destroyed his family and their lands.\n\u201cYou cannot grow unless you put down roots\u201d was the motto of Vanya\u2019s great-grandmother, who convinced the Samula Tribe to give up their nomadic life over a three hundred years ago. After his wild ways caused his mother to expel him from the tribe, Vanya became a mercenary fighting for outlying Zikia Tribes and Urugal Clans who were attempting to stop the onslaught of the Uruk Dominion. Vanya returned home years later to find his mother dead and her orchards a charred tombstone to his great-grandmother\u2019s vision. Rallying the Tribes\u2019 survivors, he now leads them against the Hamazi Empire whose greed and arrogance resulted in the scorched Zikia land.\nRead more about the Samula Tribe in this short tale.\nLORE: UTSUKA\nThe Blood Mage Rudatha has orchestrated the capture of many of his siblings, for he alone understands the Khan's true legacy.\nRaja Rudatha - or the \u201cSpider Prince\u201d as some call him - never leaves the serenity of his library, but his webs of information and influence cover the Dominion like a blanket. Yet land is not Rudatha\u2019s focus, for he alone among his vast number of siblings understands the Great Khan\u2019s true legacy. Where most see only the lands taken from conquered enemies, Rudatha sees in each of his father\u2019s conquests another Ancient One bloodline woven into his own. Each of the Great Khan\u2019s heirs is a weapon, for each represents a different combination of Ancient Ones that he or she can call on for supernatural support in battle. Rudatha plans to collect the whole set.\nRead more about the Blood of Uruk in this short tale.\nLORE: WEBS OF THE SPIDER\nLORE: THE DARK GARDEN\nSudhamra, prince of the people, has converted a rebellious populous into new regiments who unknowingly march to war only to reclaim the Emperor's lost honor.\nBorn to a Zikia Princess who had escaped from the Emperor\u2019s harem, Sudhamra grew up in the rebellious slums of his people in the Lower Hamazi Empire. Forcibly recruited into the army, he gained glory in battle and rose quickly through the ranks to be the youngest commander ever of the Empire\u2019s elite Western Wind regiment. When the armies of the Lower Empire where humbled by the Great Khan, only Sudhamra\u2019s Western Wind stood tall, but even so, it was a shock when he was selected to be Raja, Prince of the Lower Empire. After 500 years of the Lower Empire being ruled by Princes sent from the North, the people have a Prince of their own and they shower him with undying loyalty. Now Raja Sudhamra marches with the support of his people to reclaim the honor of the Empire!\nRead more about the Lower Hamazi Empire in this short tale.\nLORE: STRANGE MESSAGES\nLORE: THE JADE GUARDIANS\nGiven as a child to The Great Khan to secure a peace treaty, Izvari returned home to till her father and take his throne. She now seeks justice from those that once called her \"sister\".\nBefore he became the Great Khan, he was Jahnu Khan of Clan Uruk, whose ancient enemy was the neighboring Clan Sunu. But Jahnu was not like his ancestors. When he attacked Clan Sunu, it had nothing to do with tribal feuds - he was looking for the lost Codex of the Gudanna. As soon as Jahnu raided the tomb he was looking for, he stripped it of clues and sued for peace with Clan Sunu, agreeing never to attack them again as long as he lived. Bijin, Khan of the Clan Sunu, agreed and offered his daughter Izvari as a gift of thanks. Izvari became one of the Great Khan\u2019s wards and was educated by the Uruk court\u2019s best tutors but she was savagely schooled by the heirs to Jahnu\u2019s Saddle Throne. Izvari may have shed more tears at Jahnu\u2019s funeral pyre than her own father\u2019s but that will not stop her from destroying his children and reclaiming the lost honor of her Clan.\nRead more about the Clan Sunu in this short tale.\nLORE: IT IS OUR WAY\nWhen you pledge at the Blood Knight tier, just drop us a Kickstarter mail letting us know which character you\u2019re interested in (along with an an alternate), and if it\u2019s still available, we\u2019ll update the image to say it\u2019s taken. Blood Knights are available on a first come, first served basis. Kickstarter tells us when people join a specific tier, so in the event that more than one person choose the same character, we\u2019ll use that info to determine who get dibs.\nAs you can see, we've developed a wide assortment of Blood Knights with diverse backgrounds, allegiances, and world-views. Please note that we would be happy to change the gender of your character to suit you. Just let us know when you tell us which one you wish to be.\nAnd for those backing us at the Golem Knight level, you get to choose which Codex of golems your knight rides: Zikia, Urugal, Durani, or Gudanna. Again, use Kickstarter mail to let us know and we\u2019ll update the image below to let everyone know how many slots are left in each faction.\nThe items below are available for purchase right now in the Optional Items Menu. \n100% cotton preshrunk (\"Ultra Cotton\"), crew neck, men (S to 5XL), ladies (XS to 3XL)\nElite Units\nMany factions in Golem Arcana boast Elite Units with their own unique back-stories and tactical abilities. These Elite Units of four pre-painted plastic figures each sport their own special edition paint & statistics and come with an Elite Unit banner for their bases to call attention to their special status on the battlefield. Elite Units will have separate army point values than standard figures to ensure game balance.\n                                                                                  To purchase Optional Items:\n1. Find the stuff you want to buy on the Optional Items Menu and add up the prices\n2. Choose a reward tier (if you haven\u2019t backed the project yet) or press the blue \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button (if you\u2019ve already selected a reward tier).\n3. Enter the TOTAL of all the stuff you want AND the amount you pledged in the \u201cPledge amount\u201d box.\nIn the example above, Robin backed the project at the $110 Warrior Tier and wants to buy a War Sprite for $11, a Titan for $15, and a Colossus for $44, bringing her total to $180.\n4. Select \u201cContinue to the next step\u201d and follow the instructions. All you\u2019re doing at this point is \u201cbanking\u201d a lump sum to use on figures after the Kickstarter is over.\n5. Once the Kickstarter ends, we\u2019ll send you a link to a special backer tool that will contain the lump sum you've already banked. All you need to do then is select the stuff you want!\nWe're very excited to share our vision for where Golem Arcana can go if we exceed our funding goal. Watch the video below to find out what's possible.\nThe key to Golem Arcana\u2019s seamless connection between the tabletop and your mobile device is the Tabletop Digital Interface Stylus (TDI).\nThe Golem Arcana App knows where all your figures are because each figure\u2019s base and the game board are covered with invisible microdots. When you touch a figure with the stylus, information is transferred to the app via Bluetooth technology. The App immediately identifies which figure it is, all its capabilities, and its position on the game board. When you touch the stylus to a new region of the game board, the app instantly knows whether the move is valid or not.\nWhen you touch an enemy figure, the App automatically can tell if the attack is blocked by intervening terrain, what the range modifiers are, what the terrain modifiers are, and applies the benefits or drawbacks from characters\u2019 active magical abilities.\nThe Golem Arcana App knows all the game rules so you can\u2019t accidentally break them. You don\u2019t need to read a rulebook because everything you need to know is available on screen or with a tap of your finger or your stylus. New players learn the game quickly by following the onscreen prompts and listening to the audio feedback. Record keeping is a snap because the App tracks everything for you. It\u2019s a referee, rule book, and tracking device all-in-one. Together, the TDI stylus and App allow you to focus on what's important: face-to-face tabletop gaming in the exciting new game world of Golem Arcana (more on that later).\nBut the benefits of connecting your figures and terrain to your mobile device go way beyond automating the rules, eliminating the reference books, and handling all the record keeping for you. Golem Arcana brings features previously found in computer games to tabletop gaming. Features such as:  \nDYNAMIC SCENARIOS - Download new scenarios (such as King of the Hill, Control Points, and Defense) that keep the game fresh and evolving with new objectives, victory conditions, and terrain conditions. For example, in an Inferno scenario, all forest regions are on fire and do extra damage to any golems knocked into them.\nUPDATES & NEW CONTENT - Game mechanics and modifiers automatically update based upon our latest playtest data. No need to keep track of game supplements, errata sheets, or changes - the app does it for you! And we plan on a steady release of new content including: Campaigns, Golem Knights, Blood Knights, and Ancient Ones which will be directly available via in-app purchase.\nCOMMUNITY - Automatically upload leaderboard data, receive notifications of local events, play in easy-to-run tournaments, and more.\nSAVE GAME - Press the button, clear the table, and seamlessly resume play at any time.\nAnd these are just the beginning of the digital enhancements made possible by Golem Arcana\u2019s digital technology. Check out our STRETCH GOALS section to hear about some of the amazing things we can do if the project gets funded!\nNote that you do not need to be online to play Golem Arcana. You only need to connect to the Internet to download new updates and content, upload your game results, or take advantage of some community features.\nGolem Arcana is early in development so the game mechanics will continue to evolve, the user interface will be iterated upon several times, and the game balance will be changed and refined. If you choose to participate in our Beta Test Group Reward Tier, you can be part of that iteration process.\nMechanics Video\nThe video below provides an overview of the deeper mechanics and the kind of strategies and tactics that can emerge from using the Golems, Golem Knights, and Ancient Ones abilities in combination with each other.\nPDF of Prototype Rules\nHere's a link to a PDF that walks you through the rules that were used in the prototype played by more than 600 people at GenCon and PAX Prime. Note that while they form the foundation of the rules for the final game, there will be many changes between their current state and the final version.

The game is inspired by our love of period dramas like Upstairs Downstairs and of course Downton Abbey.\nInstead of just watching the drama unfold, we wanted to create a game where player\u2019s could experience and make the drama themselves. \nYour goal is to raise your family\u2019s status through careful marriages, hiring servants and having children all the while destroying rival families through gossip, backstabbing and using your superior wit.\nCreated by a brother and sister team, we are trying to raise funds to publish a small pressing of the game. We have some exciting rewards and stretch goals including an expansion pack with art from Carson Ellis, Eleanor Davis, Evah Fan, Marci Washington and Alec Thibodeau among others...\nThe goal of Lords and Ladies is to gain status points for your family. The first player to end a round with 18 status points wins the game.\nOver the course of the game you build generations of a family by marrying off lords and ladies to available suitors, hiring servants to give you additional status and powers, attempting to have children with your married lords and ladies and using gossip cards and servant powers to destroy your rival families' reputations.\nAdditionally, you can earn status through three special awards cards in the game: Legacy, Gossip Queen and Full Service.  These entail having the most number of generations in your family, spreading the most amount of gossip and hiring and maintaining the largest number of servants. \nLords and Ladies is played over a series of rounds where each player takes one turn. A player\u2019s turn is broken down into three parts:\nFirst they can either take two gold or a gossip card.\nThen they can decide to either:\nHire an available servant.\nMarry an available suitor.\nAttempt to have a child with a married couple.\nTake an additional gold.\n\n\nAt any point during the round players can team up to spread gossip about other families. This is accomplished by one player playing a gossip card on another player's family or servants.\nGossip only becomes confirmed when another player plays the same gossip card or a True card against the targeted player. Unconfirmed, gossip cards only last one round and then are shuffled into the discard pile.  \nPlayers can also use their servants' powers against other players, use their fortune to buy status and bribe other players to stop gossip.\nThe game ends when the first player ends a round with 18 status points.\nFor more detailed rules see the next section:\nIf you are interested in finding out more about the game and it's mechanics please check out our beta version of the rules. \nDownload the Lords & Ladies Ruleset v1.1\nIt should be noted that this ruleset will be edited and improved upon before publication.\nFor those of you who want to play Lords & Ladies now, here is a Print and Play edition to download !!!

Inspired by the predecessors of this hallowed genre like Valkyria Chronicles, Final Fantasy Tactics, and the X-COM franchise, WARMACHINE: Tactics seeks to break new ground for turn-based tactics games by delivering a never-before-seen level of dynamic battlefield combat.\nAs you\u2019ll see in the video, the development team has worked around the clock for several months to prove we have the experience and the ability to turn WARMACHINE into an incredible video game worthy of your pledge. Kickstarter has provided the opportunity to realize this vision, and with you on our side, we can make it a reality.\nTo date, we have unlocked 16 stretch goals, adding incredible content and features to the game, making your $20 pledge an amazing value!\nRivalries as old as man steep the Iron Kingdoms in a tradition of incessant war, forging in its violent fires heroes of unimaginable power and the weapons they alone can wield. This is a land dominated by iron giants and their heroic human controllers, a fantastic realm marching to the progressive cadence of an industrial revolution, where magic and technology have found common ground in the form of a new science, called \u201cmechanika.\u201d\nDominating the field of battle are the WARCASTERS, rare individuals who have mastered both sorcerous magic and martial combat and who possess the singular ability to command the mightiest warriors of the Iron Kingdoms\u2014ten-ton, flame-belching, lead-spewing machines of destruction called WARJACKS.\nWarjacks are the warcasters\u2019 greatest weapons\u2014titanic, steam-powered automatons with arcane brains, magically linked to their warcaster controllers and capable of executing their every devastating order. Together, a warcaster and his warjacks possess the power of a small army. When leading a military force, they are unstoppable.\nThe wars that engulf the Iron Kingdoms are waged by four powerful nations: imperialistic and conquest-driven Khador; heroic Cygnar, with its cutting-edge technology; the fanatical Protectorate of Menoth; and the undead \u201cNightmare Empire\u201d of Cryx. Bolstering the forces of these factions are countless mercenaries, drawn from all corners of the continent to profit from the endless conflicts. Other nations beyond the Iron Kingdoms have also entered the fray\u2014ancient and inhuman races, some who ally with the human factions and others who would see humanity destroyed.\nFor a deeper look into the world and factions of WARMACHINE, visit WARMACHINETACTICS.COM.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is a squad-level, turn-based tactics game featuring both a single-player campaign and online synchronous and asynchronous head-to-head multiplayer options.\nWhether playing the campaign or multiplayer, the command and management of your squad is key. Not only will you make defining choices about the warcaster, warjacks, and warriors that comprise your squad, but you will also utilize strong tactical direction of their strengths and abilities in battle as well as astute guidance for how they evolve over time.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics is designed around the philosophy of synergy between the members of a squad. Every unit is part of the whole and can interact with other units for greater effect. Similar to the concept of creating ability combos in a trading card game, units in WARMACHINE: Tactics can combine effects and abilities that support each other\u2019s efforts and increase one another\u2019s effectiveness. Careful and creative selection of a squad\u2019s warcaster, warjacks, and warriors is essential to an effective strategy. Plus, it means you can design exactly the force you want to put onto the battlefield.\nThen once your squad takes to the field of battle, your tactical command of their actions will govern their success. Will your squad advance cautiously, utilizing cover and outmaneuvering the enemy, or will they charge furiously into melee combat where brute force and resilience will win the day? In battle, how you command your warcaster, warjacks, and warriors and the tactical decisions you make to adapt to your enemy will determine your squad\u2019s fate.\nIn WARMACHINE: Tactics, you\u2019ll be able to save multiple squads in different configurations so that you can always pick the best load out for the mission or opponent at hand. And if you want to see how your squad stacks up, you\u2019ll be able to pit them against an AI opponent in order to try out your strategies and evaluate their performance before putting them to the true test against opponents from around the world.\nThe Iron Kingdoms are populated by rare individuals who possess incredible arcane talents in addition to unmatched combat skills. Even more important, they can mentally command and channel their power through the most devastating weapons of war\u2014warjacks. In WARMACHINE: Tactics, your squad is led by such a warcaster, one of many unique characters drawn from a colorful pantheon that makes up the epic cast of this setting. Each warcaster possesses an arsenal of weapons tailored to his personal fighting style as well as a unique combination of spells and skills. These include a defining arcane feat that, when used at the right time, can turn the tide of battle.\nWarcasters possess a replenishing reservoir of magical energy, called focus, which endows them with their superhuman abilities. Focus is used to cast spells, charge the protective fields of their specially created battle armor, and increase the effectiveness of their combat abilities.\nEvery warcaster interacts with his or her warjacks and warriors differently. One warcaster may promote aggressive strategies and bolster her squad\u2019s performance in melee combat, while another warcaster may provide greater defense and longevity to his squad, encouraging a more methodical approach to victory. The interchangeability of warcasters in WARMACHINE: Tactics provides nearly infinite replayability and ensures that no two game experiences are ever the same.\nThe spearhead of the WARMACHINE fighting force is the warjack. Outfitted with an array of wicked weaponry, these imposing constructs of steel and iron are brought to life through a fusion of steam power and magic and controlled with deadly precision by the warcaster.\nA warcaster is in constant telepathic contact with her warjacks and can channel her focus through a warjack to boost the machine\u2019s combat abilities and enable it to execute devastating power attacks.\nThe relationship between warcasters and their warjacks is as close as the kinship between any brothers in arms. Over time, a warjack gains experience and may bond with its warcaster, taking on unique personality characteristics and developing new aptitudes.\nFleshing out the squad in WARMACHINE: Tactics are the warriors. Encompassing a wide range of disciplines and roles, warriors are selected for the fighting capability and supporting tactics they add to your squad based on how you want the force to operate on the battlefield.\nSquads in WARMACHINE: Tactics are small, elite units, and the warriors that comprise them are all heroes in their own right. The warriors bring with them a gallery of incredible weapons and abilities that can make a squad perform efficiently and effectively in any situation, from rapid assaults to stealthy hit-and-run maneuvers and everything in between.\nEach battle awards warriors, warjacks, and your warcaster with experience that unlocks new options for your squad, like tactical feats for the warriors or bonds between the warcaster and his warjacks that affect the performance of the warjacks in specific situations. This ever-growing list of options can be accessed during squad building to customize your force to your precise strategy.\nEach campaign will focus on a single novice warcaster character and allow you to play through the formative experience that evolves that character into a full-fledged warcaster, also playable in multiplayer.\nThe campaigns will deliver an extensive, story-driven experience. Although conducting your squad during campaign battles works exactly like combat in multiplayer, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to choose how the central character develops her abilities through the course of her evolution.\nWARMACHINE: Tactics will ship with the \u201cNo Man\u2019s Land\u201d campaign, featuring Cygnar\u2019s Lt. Allison Jakes, a young journeyman warcaster trained as a duelist who is unexpectedly thrust into a position of great responsibility and leadership before she is ready. Under your command, Lt. Jakes will rise to the occasion in the face of horror and adversity in this harrowing story that will define her character forever in the ongoing saga of WARMACHINE.\nFuture campaigns will explore all the factions of WARMACHINE and feature a cast of characters uniquely designed for both the video game and the tabletop.\nOne of the most exciting aspects of WARMACHINE: Tactics is being able to play against your friends no matter where you are or what time it is. Online multiplayer will support both synchronous and asynchronous play, so you can compete head-to-head against a live opponent on the other side of the world, or you can play the asynchronous \u201cplay-by-mail\u201d mode, which allows both players to take turns at their leisure. If you don\u2019t have a friend available and still want to get your battle on, you\u2019ll be able to find an opponent with automatic matchmaking. And WARMACHINE: Tactics will offer casual, ranked, and tournament play to suit the style of every player.\nMultiplayer will be supported with regular releases of new maps, units, and even whole new factions. We want to ensure that your game experience is consistently fresh and offers new challenges every time you play.\nOur funding goal allows us to produce the single-player campaign and the multiplayer mode featuring playable forces with multiple warcasters, warjacks, and warriors for the Cygnar and Khador factions as well as some Cryx units that appear in the single-player campaign\u2014about three dozen units in all. We hope to get a whole lot more in there by achieving our stretch goals: the WARMACHINE tabletop game currently includes over 500 distinct warriors, warjacks, and warcasters, and our ambition is to bring as many of them into WARMACHINE: Tactics as possible. Our goal is to deliver regular expansions to the game in the form of campaign and themed bundles that will add new characters to your faction rosters and new stories to experience. Multiplayer maps will also be released regularly as free downloads, available to play by everyone.\nWe\u2019re not just going to show you some pretty pictures and expect that you\u2019ll back our project. We\u2019re going to entice you with what we hope are tantalizing offers you can\u2019t refuse!

This collaboration has allowed us time to bond, to learn to work effectively and efficiently, and to develop the trust required for two entities to undertake the challenge of bringing a dream to life. Individually, we bring vital expertise and resources to the WARMACHINE: Tactics project, and together we can achieve more than either of us ever could alone.\nPrivateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams have made a considerable investment in time and money to pay for the initial development of WARMACHINE: Tactics. We accepted this risk so that we could present a project worthy of your confidence. Our belief is that by promoting this project on Kickstarter, we\u2019ll raise the profile of the game and expand awareness of WARMACHINE to an even wider audience that will help us achieve the funding necessary to produce the best version of WARMACHINE: Tactics possible.\nIn early 2013, Privateer Press Interactive and WhiteMoon Dreams officially joined forces to co-produce WARMACHINE: Tactics without the traditional support of a publisher.\nPrivateer Press Interactive was founded by Matt Wilson, owner and Chief Creative Officer of Privateer Press, Inc., the leading independent producer of tabletop miniatures games, best known for WARMACHINE, the game of steam-powered combat set in the fantastic world of the Iron Kingdoms. The mission of Privateer Press Interactive is to bring the tabletop gaming worlds of Privateer Press into the digital medium.\nWilson, who created WARMACHINE, has worked in the game industry for over 18 years as an artist, art director, writer, and award winning game designer. Prior to the twelve years of titles he has generated at Privateer Press, Wilson art directed and was the lead concept artist for Magic: the Gathering at Wizards of the Coast, as well as contributing artistically to Dungeons & Dragons, FASA\u2019s Battletech and Shadowrun lines, and AEG\u2019s Legend of the Five Rings, where he also created the world and developed the game.\nFor six years, Los Angeles-based WhiteMoon Dreams has worked with companies all over the world to bring their games to market and has been heavily involved in game technology R&D with partners including Disney, Intel, and Tencent. WhiteMoon Dreams is helmed by founder and CEO, Jay Koottarappallil, who has spent 18 years in the video game industry working on a range of titles, including the Myth, Ratchet & Clank and Medal of Honor series\u2019.\nKoottarappallil has assembled a team of design heavyweights including Creative Director Scott Campbell, one of the key minds behind the original Fallout, and Game Director Kevin Mack, who ushered Fear Effect and Medal of Honor. Projects at WhiteMoon Dreams are managed by Executive Producer Rusty Buchert, a revered icon for indies everywhere for his work at Sony on such titles as Flow, Flower and Journey as well as being responsible for some of Interplay\u2019s biggest games, including Descent, several Star Trek games, and many others.\nBy combining and sharing resources between our two companies, we are able to move rapidly and efficiently through the development process of video game production. WARMACHINE: Tactics is a true collaboration, and because of the constant communication and the fact that WARMACHINE'S creator, Matt Wilson is part of the game\u2019s design team, we are able to ensure the most faithful interpretation of the WARMACHINE setting possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA letter from Privateer Press Interactive founder, Matt Wilson:\n\nVideo games are complex undertakings. Everything presented on the screen has been painstakingly created by many disciplined professionals\u2014artists, animators, programmers, designers, and audio and effects engineers. Games are a meticulously orchestrated symphony that, when well presented, create unforgettable interactive experiences for those who play them. If the concert isn\u2019t well executed or conducted, the result is sluggish performance, a frustrating interface, low-quality art, or missed deadlines.\n\nThese variables make predicting the outcome uncertain, but every potential problem is surmountable with the proper application of time. Ideally preparation and experience will help avoid any pitfalls, and carefully planned contingencies will make it less disruptive when one is unavoidable. The most significant challenge in software development is simply delivering what\u2019s been promised on time.\n\nWhile it may appear Privateer Press has made some bold moves in the past, the truth is, we are risk averse. We make our decisions cautiously, with great consideration and calculation. Privateer Press Interactive, being composed of the same executive team, is no different. We know our greatest risk in this is the reputation of the Privateer Press name we have built over the past twelve years, and we have not undertaken this project lightly.\n\nThe decision to launch this project on Kickstarter came after nearly a year and a half of observation and analysis of other crowdfunded projects, and our decision to make this journey with WhiteMoon Dreams follows nearly five years of friendship and trust developed from our professional association. This is not a quickly conceived scheme, nor are we entrusting our beloved WARMACHINE to an unknown quantity. We have weighed the alternatives and considered the variables, and we\u2019re confident in our choice of development partners. But that\u2019s not enough. Just like you, we needed to see it in action.\n\nTo be sure of our decision, along with WhiteMoon Dreams we have funded several months of development on WARMACHINE: Tactics so we\u2019d be able to show you something credible and worthy of your pledge. We didn\u2019t want to just show concept art and offer lengthy descriptions of the game we envision; we set out to prove we have a team with the talent to bring this world to life. New progress is made on the game daily, and we\u2019ll be sharing that with you regularly throughout the campaign and right up until the product launch. We\u2019ve chosen a realistic funding goal that will support the required development, and we\u2019ve committed to a comfortable timeline with built-in contingencies should we encounter unavoidable delays. And we have planned our current funding beyond the end of this Kickstarter so that our team can remain focused on its continued development without skipping a beat.\n\nWhen we undertook this project, we also made a pledge: we will not launch another Kickstarter project until WARMACHINE: Tactics has released and has achieved all we have promised to deliver in the basic game as well as all the stretch goals we reach. We view this Kickstarter campaign as our one shot\u2014our single opportunity to create this game on our terms, and with your support.\n \nWe will honor your support above all else.\n\nNo one knows the future. When I met Jay Koottarappallil of WhiteMoon Dreams five years ago, neither of us imagined we\u2019d someday be making our WARMACHINE game this way. But now, more than ever, I am confident it will get done\u2014and I can\u2019t wait to play it with you.\n\nMatt Wilson\nOwner & CCO\nPrivateer Press, Inc.\nPrivateer Press Interactive, Inc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "LATEST DEVELOPMENTS", "update_content": "Greetings WARMACHINE: Tactics Backers!\nWhiteMoon Dreams is forging ahead with the development of WARMACHINE: Tactics and has some great news about the latest patch, available today, and what's coming up.

P. Lovecraft\nNow, the designer of the original Call of Cthulhu role playing game, Sandy Petersen, brings a colossal new chapter to the Cthulhu Mythos.\nThe marketplace today has many boardgames featuring the Cthulhu Mythos. In these games you strive to avert the impending catastrophe. But in Cthulhu Wars you ARE the catastrophe! The Great Old Ones have returned to claim the ruins of Earth, and you are one of them!\n\nLike the Cthulhu Mythos, strategy gaming has survived the test of time. From Risk to Twilight Imperium, we have enjoyed these games. The concept behind Cthulhu Wars is to apply the principles of strategy gaming to the Cthulhu Mythos. In terms of gameplay, Cthulhu Wars probably resembles the Fantasy Flight product Chaos in the Old World as much as any single other game, but, ultimately Cthulhu Wars is its own beast.\nCthulhu Wars is a competitive strategy game in which 3 to 5 players produce cultists and monsters, build mystic gates, and awaken Great Old Ones. The players earn spellbooks, try to destroy their enemies, and capture their bases. Each faction has its own unique set of monsters, spells, and its own Great Old One(s).\nTo get an in-depth look at the game, click on the banners below to watch gameplay videos, download the PDF of Cthulhu Wars' rules, or read the Cthulhu Wars' rules summary.\nThis is a first-rate product. The map is mounted and two-sided. The box is sturdy. The miniatures -- we will let them speak for themselves. This is for people who appreciate solid quality components in their gaming experience.\nMiniatures\nThe highly detailed Cthulhu Wars' miniatures were hand sculpted by the experts at Fenris Games in Great Britain. The figures are designed to 28mm scale \u2013 perfect for use in other games such as D&D, Call of Cthulhu, Descent, Zombicide, and if you dare, Arkham Horror.\nEach copy of Cthulhu Wars comes with 64 high detailed miniatures (Ultimately, over 200 with expansions). They vary in scale from normal human-sized entities (ghouls or Deep Ones) up to huge pieces \u2013 larger than any game pieces we\u2019ve encountered.\nWe are a small team of 3 guys. We have a passion for making games, and have come together with a shared dream. We are doing this out of a garage, trying to get something we believe is truly special out to the fans. That being said, we can't do it alone. It costs a lot of money to produce a quality game, and that's why we have come to you. Through our Kickstarter, we are offering as low a price as possible for the largest Cthulhu game ever assembled.\nA lot of hard work has gone into designing and prototyping Cthulhu Wars. Now is your chance to be part of that excitement, just choose from one or more of our many pledge levels and help support us in making this game a reality. As the Kickstarter progresses, and we begin hitting our stretch goals, we will unlock more expansions and free goodies!\nWe love to reward you with FREE stuff, including 9 HUGE Great Old One miniatures, just pledge a minimum of $200 (not including shipping) in any combination you wish. That means, even if you are an Early Bird, just add a little more to your order and all of the rewards can be yours!\nWe recommend the Cultes Des Goules Pledge level. This is the sweet spot where you will get the most Bang for your Buck! You will receive 12 Custom Cthulhu Dice, Kickstarter Exclusive First Player Marker, Opener of the Way Expansion, and ALL Great Old Ones stretch goals rewards and more!\n* Kickstarter Exclusive - only available on Kickstarter or conventions.\n*Purchase of any expansion requires a pledge of Cultist or higher.\nEach turn, the new Starting Player gets a special token showing his status, plus he gets to choose the direction play will proceed for that turn. Normally this is a sturdy die-cut counter. But only on Kickstarter you will be able to get a high quality plastic miniature of Asenath Waite for the First Player, plus she is pointing out the direction of play for you! Get her now!\n*Purchase of any expansion requires a pledge of Cultist or higher.\n*Purchase of any expansion requires a pledge of Cultist or higher.\nWe want to give you, the players, the best Cthulhu Wars experience possible. We've designed 13 expansions for our game along with other awesome add-ons. We need your help to make these expansions a reality. If we can hit all of our stretch goals, we can make Cthulhu Wars expandable to over 200 miniatures and multiple world maps. Of course we know this couldn't happen without you the fans, so we are going to give back as much as we can as we hit our stretch goals.  We need your help!\nBehind every great project, there is a talented team driven by a shared dream. Our dream began over 30 years ago, when Sandy got his start in the game industry in the early 1980s, where he first designed paper role-playing games. His best-known work from that time is the cult game Call of Cthulhu, which has been translated into many languages and is still played world-wide. He also worked on many other role-playing projects, such as Runequest and Elfquest, and was instrumental in the creation of dozens of supplements and game aids.\n \nIn 1988, he left paper games for the computer game world. He has worked for Microprose, id Software, and Ensemble Studios, where he was involved with Civilization, Doom, Quake, the Age of Empire series, and Halo Wars, among others.\nThis team has a proven track record, and our games have sold tens of millions of copies worldwide, and have received dozens of awards from the game industry.\nOur new company, Green Eye Games is comprised of Creative Director Robert M. Atkins, the uber talented Art Director, Richard Luong, who created all of the concept art and illustrations for the game and the legendary Design Director Sandy Petersen.\n \nTogether our passion for both gaming and Lovecraft are combined in our dream project \u2013 Cthulhu Wars.\nWhy is Shipping and Handling Internationally so High?\nOur game is huge. It masses over 8 lbs (3.6 Kilograms), we've checked international shipping and it costs over $60 to ship to the UK. We are charging only $45 shipping and taking a $15 hit on every game we sell, not adding for shipping materials. This is hard to do for a small start up company as ourselves. We are doing everything we can to get this game to you, the players around the world, who are supporting our game, and we couldn't be more grateful for your understanding.\nUpdated for our European backers! After consulting with several logistics companies, we are happy to announce that we will be able to help you save money on import taxes. Because pledges on Kickstarter are explicitly for the \"funding of a project in a pre-retail environment,\" we can ship our products to you with a declared commercial value equal to the core manufacturing cost, rather than your full pledge amount. This should save a lot on any VAT taxes which may apply. We are also exploring other options which could potentially provide additional savings, including manufacturing and distribution from within the E.U.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game has been in playtest since November, 2012, and it is now rock-solid \u2013 extremely playable and fun. Cthulhu Wars is a finished, polished game. All we need is the money to start publishing it, so it can get into the homes and hearts of gamers and Cthulhu lovers worldwide. But there is a lot of work still to do. Even though the game has been designed, thoroughly tested, and all the art has been created for it, all of the miniatures still need to be mastered for plastic production, and the game components need to be finalized and printed.\n\nIt's very easy to get overwhelmed with all the work that it takes to make a board game, let alone the largest Cthulhu game ever created with all the miniatures too. We have figured out the costs and have worked it, so that we can offer you the cheapest price yet still make it a viable venture, and keep the components high in quality. We are just a small team of guys, and we want to be smart in our planning and expectations. There are a lot of pledges to fulfill, plus add-ons and expansions to manage. With that being said, we are working with a great manufacturing company that has shipped successful Kickstarter projects in the past and we have full confidence that we can deliver the game to you in time. In any case, we will be happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all (such as Cthulhu rising from the deep).

I speak, of course, of Gods War.\nAs I'm sure you all know, Cthulhu Wars is a lot like a knife-fight in a back alley. Everyone is biting and gouging and rolling around fighting dirty.

They're simple, charming and completely relatable, even though all their human details are completely stripped away. They're nothing but the mere suggestion of a person.\nWhen you draw bits of clothing on them or add muscles, they begin to take on specific identity traits. Adding a skirt, it becomes a girl (or Scotsman), adding a sword transforms it into a warrior.\nMo is a 3 dimensional stick figure, a blank canvas that you can 'paint' with your own imagination. By adding just a few descriptive parts, he becomes anything that you want him to be. By adding lots of parts, he takes on more personality and, like a painting, he looks and feels more specific and 'real'.\nMo is at your service and ready to take part in your adventures, celebrations, hobbies, creative projects, and dreams.\nDesign-your-own\nModiBot Part Matrix- new parts being added everyday\nWe've worked in the product world for a long time and, more-and-more, the toys we buy are designed for our hyper-efficient retail system. They're designed toward what is easiest to produce and sell, not necessarily what is the most fun or interesting for the user. It reduces risk for the maker and retailer, but it favors sameness and predictability.\nInspired by the digital disruption of the media industries and the promise of 3d printing as a source of manufacturing, we began building a new way to make and deliver maximum variety in toy products. \nWe designed the ModiBot play system to-\nbe intuitively easy to build using a 'linear' connection method\npromote 'free-building', discovery and creativity\nbe upgradable, which extends the life of the toy and tailors it to the needs of the user\nmake it notoriously simple to replace broken or damaged parts\nbe fun to personalize for any opportunity or occasion\ncreate tool for users to tell their own stories and travel to worlds that only they can see in their heads\nTough, durable body parts\nMolding a 'stick figure' with lots of connectors is not easy. During the manufacturing process, we found that maintaining our design required that we move to a extremely durable, high-impact plastic called polycarbonate. The choice really enabled us to make some very high tolerance joints which enabled much better accessory fit and more poseability. \nWe knew we wanted him to be a great chassis for our parts, the unexpected benefit was that he became a great tool for story telling through stop-motion animation.\nPersonalizing products on-demand via 3d printing\nA fully 3d printed figure with a variety of printed accessories\nPersonalization is nothing new in the toy industry. We've all been personalizing and accessorizing our playthings for more than 70 years using press-fit, add-on parts. Its a perennial favorite with kids and the back bone of most of their favorite video games and apps\nWhat has been limited in the past is your overall amount of options. Our ultimate goal is to provide unlimited options for personalizing your products. If you are the only person in the world that wants a witches hat, we want to offer you the ability to have the accessory that completes your creation.\nWe've already built, prototyped and uploaded more than 450 different parts that can currently be purchased and printed on-demand from our BotShop at Shapeways.com. Unlike traditional products on a shelf, those parts are sitting as digital files like an eBook, waiting to be purchased and turned into real 3 dimensional products via an amazing process called 3d printing (or additive manufacturing). \nIf you haven't seen how 3d printing works, check out the video below. Its nothing short of amazing that a pile of dust and a laser can 'grow' into usable products.\nDesigned for the future\nSince last year, we've added approximately 20-40 parts (and many full kits) each month. As we can make this more of our day-to-day business, the more parts we'll be able to release. We're in the process of rebuilding all of our current part library for compatibility with the new molded figure. Our goal is to publish an additional 400 new parts by the end of the year.\nThat's just the start. As 3d printers become more commonplace, we're investigating ways for people to design, order and print their favorite parts at home, shop or at a print bureau down the street. We're in the initial stages of testing the process for materials, methodology, and pricing.

To help us with the parts of the process we don't know, we've hired a professional sourcing agent. Consequently, as far as Kickstarter product campaigns go, our risks are fairly low. \n\nManufacturing- We've already started the manufacturing process on the Mo figure and Venture accessory set. The figure images shown are production pilot parts produced from the steel molds in China, not prototypes. The figure colors shown are the approved molded colors, not painted.\n\n3D printing- All 3d printed accessory sets listed in our initial reward levels have been built, print-tested and are ready to manufacture as of campaign launch. The 3d printed accessory colors shown are options currently available from our printing partners at Shapeways.com.\n\nPackaging- There is almost no risk of delay due to packaging. Items will be delivered using a minimalist approach to reduce waste, but still protect your parts during shipment.\n\nReach goals- For any accessory-based reach goals, we currently have hand-drawn renderings of any additional 3d printed kit concepts. As we acheive certain reach goals, we will begin 3d modeling those items,b be finished by campaign end. These will be debugged in the 3d printing process and delivered on the same delivery date as the existing core items. This prototyping process usually takes about 40 days in total.\n\nFulfillment/shipping- This is likely our largest blind spot and area of risk for hitting our schedule, we've done the research on mailing and packaging to protect our items during shipment. Depending on how big things get, this could be an issue getting much larger quantities of product from China via boat vs. our current plan to airship parts.\n\nOur goal is to ship earlier than our listed date of October, if possible.

Created and developed in Russia, Berserk was first published in 2003. Over the years it has been hugely successful in Russia and more than 20 expansions and over 4000 different cards were published. We enhanced the basic rules of the game, chose the best illustrations and mechanics, and now we are planning to launch it worldwide.\n     Why is the game called \"Berserk\", what does it mean?  Berserk - is a fierce warrior who fights in a nearly uncontrollable, trance-like fury, feeling neither pain nor mortal wounds.  We thought the name is a good fit for the game.\n     Berserk is a wargame where players use cards istead of miniatures. This simplifies and speeds up the game considerably: no need to refer to charcater manuals.\n     Both players deploy the cards on the battlefield face down. Thus the opponent cannot see the other player\u00b4s army. Then both players turn their cards over and the battle begins!\nCasual game-play video:\n     The world of Berserk consists of 6 realms, featuring different playing strategies. Here is a brief overview of the decks that come in a game set.\n     In the swamp deck you will meet the Mermaids. The longer they stay alive, the better the chance that the opponent's army will die from poison. Mermaids use poisons like no other creatures of Laar.\n     The Draconites are creatures of fire and their scales are an excellent armor. The fewer lives a Draconite has, the more difficult it is to harm him.  The only thing you need is to keep\u2019em all close to each other for defense.\n     In the deck of darkness you will meet the Demons. What can be said about demons? They like to die and then come back from the dead stronger than ever. If you want to see your opponent suffer then this is the deck for you.\n     The Dwarves rule the mountains and this is their deck. They are great at holding their ranks. If you enjoy strategically manipulating and positioning your army in order to win, then try the mountain deck.\n     The forest deck is the deck of the Elves. If you like to shoot at your opponents without getting too close \u2013 this is the deck for you. Elves also have the best healers in Laar. Finally, their swords are almost as deadly as their arrows. This is the really balanced army.\n     Last but not least there are the Orcs. Orcs, they are... hmm... orcs. Lots of lives, strong in attacking, very few brains, you know... They are easy to command \u2013 just send them to battle and hope they destroy the opponent with brutal force.\n     Also we would like to present you these additional cards of the Deluxe Edition ($50 pledge).\n     Also there are additional cards, that don\u2019t belong to any of the realms. They are called neutral cards. They are usually supporting cards and balance the decks without adding any additional realm. All these cards have their unique abilities when fighting the other realms.\n     The last types of cards are the Multi-element cards. In terms of costs, these cards are very strong. They belong to 2 or more realms and are usually combined with your cards. They are used when you upgrade your deck and try to play with 2 or more realms. Deck building is one of the most interesting parts of the game. Adding multi-element cards allows you to experiment with building 2, 3 or even 6 realm decks.\nDear friends, from now on you have the option of ordering additional Berserk goodies, and useful game components. It will also bring us closer to fulfilling our next stretch goals!\nAdditional Dice: For and additional $5 you have the option of getting a set of 4 additional dice. Now you can play a draft tournament for 8 players.\nDraft rules: combine and shuffle all cards from War of the Realms. Each player takes 10 cards and the draft begins (take one card, pass the rest to a player clockwise). The draft continues, until all 10 cards are taken. Then take another 10 cards and go on with the draft. And then \u2013 a final 10 cards, which will give you a deck of 30 cards to play with.\n\"Heroes of six realms\"\nEach of the 6 realms has 4 cards that do not belong to any class and give you a lot of flexibility in using them! And the final 5th card for each realm is a new class card the \"Hero\". These heroes bring you a new game variant. With this version of the game each player has a Hero, who comes as a 16th card to your hand, and he or she will lead your troops to victory!  \nT-shirts\nFor an additional $15 we will send you a T-Shirt with a print that you like. Since we have A LOT of prints to choose from, don\u2019t stop at one shirt, order more! We will make all the sizes from S to 3XL.\nDuel Deck \"Knights and Villians\"\nDuel Deck \"Knights and Villians\" Surprise! We decided not to wait until we reach 60.000$, and make the Russian fantasy set Knights vs. Villains available now! This set is based on the Russian folklore, which are pretty cool. The cards of this expansion have a special design. Some of them took part at the Boardgamegeek contest. (link) This expansion contains two decks of 30 cards, +4 Kickstarter exclusive cards. If you wish, you may combine duel decks with the War of the Realms base set. \nThe cards in Knights vs. Villains are a bit more simple than in the base set, but it does not mean that it is less interesting to play with them. This set would also make a great gift for your friend, whom you would like to teach to play Berserk. Knights vs. Villains also could come in separate box and in this variant it is an independent expansion, you do not have to have War of the Realms to play with it. This expansion also contains rules of the game, counters, and dice. \nAdditional Deluxe version. Additional Deluxe bid, which will have the same contents as your copy.From now on, both your friend and you can create your own decks idependently from a collection of cards that you possess\nArt book. \nA5 in size and 100 Pages full of illustrations! There you will find most interesting character from Berserk Universe, most scenic locations and most spellbinding art made by dozens of russian artists\nMore add-ons will be later.\n     For $40 you\u2019ll receive a full game of \u00abBerserk: War of Realms\u00bb. Six ready to play decks each with 30 cards. The game also includes a how-to-play comic strip, comprehensive rules, cardboard counters, and 2 unique dice.\n     This is the Deluxe Edition of the game. It contains all the material of the Warrior of Realms plus an additional 63 cards (neutral + multi-element). They help you to upgrade your decks or to build new ones. Also, we added 2 hard-cover game boards and 2 more dice. Try the new game mod with 2 additional dice allows up to 4 players to play simultaneously.\n     This is our Art Bid. It has everything from the Battlemage bid + you will receive 3 original posters singed by the creators of the game and one unique t-shirt of your choice.\n     Yep. This is an Axe. There are only 10 of them. Nope. The blood is not real. Once a year we present 3 of these axes to the best players of the game. A few facts about the Axe: It is almost 2 feet high and it weighs more than 6 pounds (made of artificial stone)! Wanna see some photos of the Axe? Click here or here.\n     Do you want to become a part of the game? Send us your photo and after the Kickstarter campaign is over, we\u2019ll talk about the features of your future character.\n     This card will be made by artists, then manufactured and included in the Deluxe Edition for free.\n     We will work out the card specifics together with you.\n     Hurray, we have managed to get 15000$. We would like to congratulate our team and all those people who have supported us! On this occasion we have prepared a surprise for you! We hope that it will be the first one among many of them. We have added 7 new cards exclusively for Kickstarter and those who pledged for Deluxe version and higher will get them for free.     \nAs you have already noticed we decided to animate the creatures from the box :) . Moreover, these cards have very peculiar abilities and each deck now will be able to play in a new way.http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.370360109742296.1073741831.326936797417961&type=3&uploaded=7\n     For each creature type in each realm, we designed a unique Area card. Every Deluxe Version or better will receive 6 unique Areas\n     Each Area card may increase the defense or attack skills of your army. Some Areas inflict damage to your army. How? We\u00b4ll see after we collect $25 000.  This stretch goal is Kickstarter exclusive.\n     It is not a secret that Angels have the most beautiful illustrations of the game. The secret lies in the abilities that flying gives to these charming creatures. This stretch goal is Kickstarter exclusive.\nWe decided to design a brand new art book with the best illustrations of our game. The illustrations will also come with interesting facts about the characters. You may add 25$ to your pledge and we will sent it to you.\n     The Plague is coming to Laar and it looks like some powerful force is guiding it... Do you have the strength to stop the invasion? If we reach this stretch goal, you will have a separate option of ordering Laar's Destiny.\n     New Sleeves and deck boxes.\n     Hobby World is the leading Russian board and card game company.

We've come so far in pairing these two genres together, and we're asking for your help to take us across the finish line\nCryptozoic Entertainment, creators and publishers of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, is excited and proud to introduce HEX: Shards of Fate, the first real MMO/TCG. A completely unique game that takes place in an original and exciting fantasy world, HEX was created from the ground up as a digital trading card game and brings tremendous innovation to how a TCG can be played.\nWith all the social interaction and roleplaying you would expect from a fully featured MMORPG, along with the deep strategic and collectible game play of a TCG, HEX is a completely new gaming experience. We're designing full card sets, dungeons, storyline, community tools, advanced AI, and so much more. This is a massive undertaking and that's why we're asking for your help to bring HEX to life.\nWhat are our goals for HEX?\n\u2022 We want to bring together both experienced TCG veterans and new players who have never played a collectible card game before. The game is free to download and play, so anyone can give it a try!\n\u2022 We want you to join guilds with other TCG players and practice dueling with the latest deck builds. \n\u2022 We want you to enter online TCG tournaments and win awesome prizes. \n\u2022 We want you to take your TCG skills and have them drive an RPG experience, unlocking new cards and treasure, as well as developing your character within a compelling, completely original story.\n\u2022 Most of all, we want the experience to be deep, engaging, and polished.\nThat\u2019s what we want to provide for you \u2026 but we need your help!\nHEX takes everything you would expect from a full, deep trading card game and combines it with a massively multiplayer online role-playing game\nLet\u2019s start by discussing the elements of the TCG.\nThe great news is that HEX was designed from the ground up to take advantage of the \u201cdigital\u201d part of \u201cdigital TCG\u201d. This means we have innovated a number of fun and unique ways of doing things that have never been done before in a TCG, which are detailed below. \nHere at Cryptozoic, our bread and butter is creating polished TCGs; it\u2019s how we make our living. When it comes to producing a balanced and deep TCG experience, the design is king. The fun digital features will always support and enhance the play experience, and never trump it. Features like clean resource tracking, transforming cards, and allowing you to easily broadcast your games to viewers across the internet are all possible due to innovation in the digital space. \nFor experienced TCG players, we have designed the card set around Booster Draft and Limited play. We have engineered the card sets to launch three times a year, like a standard TCG. We have put a tremendous amount of work into creating the best possible online TCG experience, both in terms of balance and design, as well as a graphical polish. \nNot only that, but surrounding this TCG is an amazing online role-playing experience\nAs can be expected from the company that makes the World of Warcraft TCG, we are a company filled to the brim with hardcore MMORPG players, and some of our designers have even built MMORPGs in the past. For example, Kevin Jordan, who was one of the three original designers of the universe\u2019s most successful MMORPG, World of Warcraft, is now the lead for the HEX MMORPG elements.\n As hardcore MMORPG players, we had a huge list of features that we thought could really make an online TCG incredible! Not the least of which is a robust, story-based PVE experience, complete with dungeons and raids and monsters and loot, all tied around playing a card game. When we started thinking about PVE, community, guilds, auction houses, factions, storytelling (all the stuff that makes an MMORPG fun), we knew that HEX could be something special, something that had never been done before! \nIt is difficult to get all the innovation built into HEX into one easy-to-digest place, but let\u2019s give it a try with this handy\u2026 \nFEATURES LIST!\nMMORPG:\n- Create your CHAMPION character with a choice of 6 classes and 8 races\nFully customizable champions with talents, gear, and game altering abilities that revolutionize the TCG experience.\nPre alpha game play\n- Collect GEAR in rarities from common to legendary and tailor your champion\u2019s winning strategy\nEach card in the game is linked to several pieces of gear that fundamentally change how the card works.

World of Warcraft TCG has been translated into 9 languages, and with millions of packs in print, it is one of the most popular TCGs in the world!\nCryptozoic makes games based on some of the most popular brands!\n\nThe scope and magnitude of HEX is bonkers! Not only are we trying to create a completely new gaming category (the MMO/TCG), but we are doing it at a scale that is just plain crazy \u2026 for example, this will be the largest first set of cards ever created for a TCG launch.\nBut we feel this is the type of game that needs to have everything in the first pass to make it work as a whole. The magic of HEX is that it has so many different things working together to create something remarkably fun and different.\nWe have been in development for almost two years and have accomplished a lot. As you can see from our videos and screenshots, the game is looking incredible. But we need your help to finish. With this last push we can fund HEX\u2019s remaining development and give this game the launch it deserves.\nAll of our reward tiers offer huge values.

Video game development is not easy. It can be difficult to predict the stumbling blocks even in the best case scenario, so with something as new and innovative as HEX, it can be even more difficult. \n\nThe good news is that HEX has been in development for almost two years and we have built a series of deliverables that we believe can be completed in the remaining development time we have scheduled. We have tested the game systems and feel confident everything will socket together and create a fantastic experience. Further game testing is of critical importance, and we have planned for a staggered beta phase that will allow us to polish the experience and catch all the bugs (this is will include both private and public testing).\n\nWe hope to break new ground with HEX. It\u2019s not enough to just be new and different, you have to also be great, and that\u2019s our focus. Everyone on the HEX team is completely dedicated to making the best game possible, and with your help, we are confident we can deliver.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #175", "update_userinfo": "Backer Reward Recovery", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWe very much intend to do everything we can to preserve your rewards.

See the FAQ section below\nHelp bring the smash indie hit of 2012 back!\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce a collaborative effort with Rikki Tahta & La Mame Games to make this fantastic game more readily available for everyone to enjoy.  We have everything ready, including the incredibly amazing artwork that this game deserves - all we need now is some help to fund the production and shipping to get games to you.\nThe Resistance: Coup\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.  But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.  In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nIf you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review of the 1st edition from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer  Note - this is 1st edition of the game. Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different.\nThere are a number of other great reviews for this game, including these links:  Undead Viking Video Review, Trent Hamm - Written Review, I Slay The Dragon - Written Review\n\nRikki Tahta - the designer of Coup explains his game to the BGG team at Essen 2012.  Note - this is 1st edition of the game.  Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different\nPromos\nCoup Promos - Every pledge reward level will include a set of cards for \"The Inquisitor\", an alternative role card that can be used in place of the game's \"Ambassador\" role.  And as a stretch reward, we are also including an Inquisitor token for The Resistance.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos. \nThe Resistance promos - Also included in every reward package are dsytopian themed Merlin & Assassin cards. If you are a fan of the art from The Resistance, and want to add these roles from The Resistance:Avalon, you'll love these promos.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos.\nThe Resistance Avalon Promos - if your pledge rewards include The Resistance: Avalon, you'll also get a copy of the cards needed to play the Excalibur and Lancelot variants of this game.\nAlso included in every reward level will be the two fixed cards for The Resistance Avalon.  These cards correct the misspelled word \"Unkown\".\nAdd-ons\nExcalibur/Lancelot promos - these are included at no additional cost for each copy of Avalon you are receiving as part of your rewards ($35 & $50 pledge levels). If you want to add the Excalibur/Lancelot promo cards on their own you can do so by adding $6 to your pledge, as an alternative you can get these from the boardgamegeek.com store for the same price.\n\nMayDay Premium Sleeves in the 65mm x 100mm size can be added to all reward levels for an additional $3.99. These are high quality sleeves perfect for keeping secret information secret. The sleeve packs contain 80 sleeves - and Coup with promos is at 30 cards now, so you will have some extras to share with your friends or to use on a second set of cards.\nExtra copies of Coup for the ten packs - The highest of our reward tiers, you can add additional copies of Coup for $12 (US shipping) or $15 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the ten pack.\nExtra copies of Coup for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - You can add additional copies of Coup for $13.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nAdding The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the six & ten packs - you can add either of these games for $15 (US Shipping) or $20 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the six & ten packs. These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.\nAdding extra copies of The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - you can add either of these games for $15 These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nTo include any of these add-ons - first click the \"manage pledge\" button, then increase your pledge amount without changing your reward level.\nAt the end of the project kickstarter will send you a project survey (about 6 weeks before games are ready to ship) - in that project survey I will capture all the information I need to get all the information that I need to get your rewards to you including numbers and composition of your add-ons.\nAll the Add-ons are priced per unit (eg, Add-on The Resistance $15/$20 is for one copy of the game).\nStretch Rewards\nWe'll introduce a limited line of stretch goals for this project - a combination of promos and exclusive promos cards featuring alternative art.  These promo cards will highlight your contribution to this project and I am sure will be highly sought after the project ends.  \n$10K - Box upgrades - see update #1, we are upgrading the game box with a very elegant and attractive foil finish box.\n$15K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Captain - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$20K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Contessa - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$25K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Ambassador - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$30K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Duke - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$35K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Assassin - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game. At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players!\n$40K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Inquisitor promo - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game (the Inquisitor promo won't be in the retail game either!). At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players with either the Ambassador or the Inquisitor roles!\n$50K - The Resistance token of \"The Inquisitor\" - This is an optional role for Don Esridge's The Resistance, familiar to Avalon fans as the \"Lady of the Lake\".\n$70K Extra Set of Coup Roles -  a second set of the Exclusive Promo role cards that have already been unlocked.  With these extra cards you can play up to 10.\n$90K More alternative art - We'll replace the 6 role cards from the $70K reward with new alternative art cards.  This means that you can either play up to 10, or you can play up to 6 with unique art on every card.  These are also Exclusive Promo cards.\n$110K \"kickstarter edition\" game box -  Final details aren't worked out, but I am thinking that we would include the kickstarter logo on the box side and on the box back (in place of the bar code).  This will only be done for the first printing - so it will be another very unique item that you can only get if you were part of this project (or getting this game in Essen 2013).\nKickstarter editions of the game will feature a dual sided player aid. One side will have the all the roles for the retail version and the other side will replace the ambassador with the inquisitor. Just another small way to thank you all for your support and distinguish the version of the game that you are getting as backers.\n$130K Coin Upgrade - an upgrade to foil backed coins that feel very futuristic. We are still experimenting with different holo foils to find the one that is going to work the best - but here is what we are looking at for the $130K stretch reward upgrade coins:\n\nNew stretch rewards are added as they are unlocked.  Promos are things that aren't going to be included in the retail version of the game. Exclusive promos are items that are even more limited than our standard promos, and will only be available through Indie Boards and Cards (at events like Essen for example) or our direct representatives. We aren't limiting any of these promos to kickstarter, but it's still not going to be easy to get the exclusives outside of kickstarter.\nWhat is the \"World of The Resistance\"\nIndie Boards and Cards started by publishing three games in 2010 - the biggest success of those games was The Resistance designed by Don Eskridge.  The Resistance is a game of secret identities, deduction and deception for 5-10 players.  The game play instill a deep sense of mistrust among the players, and makes for a great time among friends and families.   The setting for The Resistance is a dystopian future, but a rather bland future.  As the popularity of The Resistance continues to grow there have been more and more requests to develop a comprehensive back story for the game.  Coup is the first step in this direction, and I am optimistic that we will see the story behind The Resistance provide more background for future games from Indie Boards and Cards.\nIf you are not familiar with the game play of Don Eskridge's The Resistance, you can get no better explanation then watching this celebrity filled cast playing the game:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this edition of the game - I am just not sure that the game is going to be  popular enough to print in the minimum required print runs and sell them via distribution.  \n\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game - the promos for Coup, The Resistance and The Resistance: Avalon.  Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production. \nWhat are the shipping costs to Canada?\nKickstarter only lets you list one international shipping charge, so if you are getting the $35 or $50 pledge rewards sent to Canada - please select \"Ship to the US\" (this is a manual process) and then add the extra $ to your pledge as follows:\n$35 Pledge Levels - $15 extra (Pledge $50 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $20 Extra (pledge $70 for this reward level)\nInternational Shipping - Outside of Canada - Kickstarter should Charge this automatically\n$35 Pledge Levels - $20 extra (Pledge $55 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $30 Extra (pledge $80 for this reward level)\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools.   Be sure to look for The Resistance, Flash Point: Rescue, and Gauntlet of Fools wherever games are sold. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I promise that if you keep your comments positive and proactive that the project will get more in the way of stretch goals and get your rewards to you sooner. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. Have an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Ready to go on a Quest?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).

She was so excited, but little did she know, I was about to become a sewing machine hog.\nI wanted a smaller more versatile wallet that could make my life easier, so I took over the kitchen table for a month and sewed for hours every night. After realizing it no longer was just a one wallet project, I shifted everything into my office.\nThis was the first wallet I made for myself. This was before it became known as the Crabby Wallet. I am glad it has evolved into something much better.\nThe first wallet didn't look too good, but I liked the functionality of it. With a lot of trial and error and some coaching from my mom, I was able to make the wallet look, feel, and function better.\nI sketched out a better version of the wallet and started on round two.\nAfter I hand sketched the wallet, I opened Illustrator to create a version that would allow me to move the pieces around.\nI made some changes and then created a pattern to start making wallets for my friends and family.\nThis is the first batch of wallets that I made for other people to test and give feedback. (The long keyring loops are attached to these wallets, but the picture is too dark to see them and they are tucked in the front pocket).\nMy wife posted this Instagram of my wallets requesting people to test them. I mailed them out and received some feedback on the wallets.\nAdding color seemed to be the next appropriate thing to do. I also attached the keyring loop on the inside of the front pocket this round as a different option. I found that the loop was more useful on the outside and smaller.\nAt this stage, the crab comes in. Most people know me as \"Crabby\" (derived from my last name). Everyone naturally started calling it the Crabby Wallet. The name stuck, and I knew I had to mark the wallet with a crab.\nI didn't have the equipment to put the crab on the wallet, so I started making connections with some manufacturers to see how it could be done. This is the prototype they sent back with a crab embroidered on it.\nWith a prototype on hand, I needed some pictures and video for Kickstarter. I bought some PVC, white bed sheets, umbrellas, and some tripods to put together a shooting studio in my office.\nHere are the final wallet options for Kickstarter backers. All of the wallets I made were of colors I found at local craft stores. With your backing I will be able to have the wallets manufactured in regular solid colors.\nWallet Specs: \nDimensions- 3 7/16\" x 2\" x 1/8\" \nMaterial- Elastic\nPockets - 2 \nAttachment loop\nCard securing band (can fit over an iphone)\nCapacity- 10+ Cards \nColors- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, Grey, Black\nTrue Story: \nMy friend lost his credit card in his wallet.\nMy wife and I recently returned home from a vacation to California with some friends. As we were getting ready to board our flight, my friend couldn't find his credit card. He contacted the rental car company thinking he had left it in the car after filling up with gas. The rental company double checked the car, but found nothing. My friend searched his wallet over and over again, but still couldn't find it. Fearful he would have to cancel his card, he resorted to emptying all of the contents of his wallet while seated on the plane. I was amazed at the heaping pile of stuff that came out. Luckily for my friend, he found his credit card hidden deep in his wallet.\nFor me, the vacation went smoothly using my Crabby Wallet. In fact, it was more convenient than I had ever expected. Clearing security at the airport was easier than ever with my car key and phone securely bundled with my wallet. My ID was easily accessible when required.\nWhile at the theme parks in California, I had everything I needed and nothing more all in my front pocket with my Crabby Wallet. The wallet made the trip so simple. All of the park's reentry tickets and fast pass tickets slid easily into the front access pocket. Needless to say, I didn't lose my credit card in my wallet unlike my friend. I did however, lose my wedding ring. I guess I should have attached it to my Crabby Wallet somehow.\nGoal:\nHave enough backers to put a crab in your pocket!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI know that timely fulfillment of rewards is extremely important to backers.

Each story will be 3 to 10 minutes long, with an introduction by a host. The first season will be a collection of 3 episodes.\nDistribution\nMost individual stories will be available free online\u2014through YouTube or Vimeo\u2014in order to generate maximum exposure for the project.  Complete episodes will be available as pay downloads and DVDs. \nEach episode will contain at least one story not available for free. DVDs will contain 3 episodes, plus bonus material. The DVD and pay download versions of stories will be uncut and uncensored. Distribution through iTunes, Amazon, and Netflix, as well as our own website and live events.\nThe Stories\nOne of the biggest challenges will be to narrow down which of the stories to start with. Besides a huge collection of original stories I have written over the years, I will create stories with a long list of collaborators\u2014including published authors I have known over the years, who all share my love of the genres.\nIn addition, I plan to adapt stories, concepts and characters from the public domain, including the work of H. P. Lovecraft\u2014a fitting focus, considering we are filming in his home city of Providence, Rhode Island. As it stands, I have enough material for a few seasons\u2019 worth of episodes.\nOnce we are deep into production, I plan to experiment with improvisational filmmaking.\nSince the individual stories are very short, the challenge is to condense the ideas into pure visual storytelling, as they will feature little or no dialog.\nRecycling will be an important concept behind the project. Not just recycling whatever materials at my disposal to create props, costumes and sets as a budgetary necessity, but will also extend to reusing those elements as well as characters and situations from one story to another, connecting seemingly disparate tales of different genres.\nThe Look\nMuch of the look of the series will be influenced by the psychedelic horror and pop art sci-fi of the 60s, such as the work of Mario Bava, Roger Corman's Poe films, the original Star Trek, Doctor Who, and The Prisoner. These and many others will serve as inspiration, not only in terms of style, but also as models for making a studio-bound production as economically but visually interesting as possible.\nMost of the films will be shot at my studio in front of a rear projection screen with modular set pieces (as demonstrated in the test footage). With that setup, we can create a wide variety of stylish settings as cheaply as possible. One of the main goals of this project is to make sure it will not look like anything being produced right now. I am tired of seeing the same aesthetics and color palettes among most modern horror and sci-fi films. Although I\u2019m looking at the past as an inspiration, I am determined to make something with a totally original look.\nVisual effects will be a major part of the series, but I will focusing on old-school techniques to achieve them. Miniatures, puppets and in-camera effects will be used, but I'm not afraid of digital technology to clean up and expand on the images. I want to create a balance of the best of both techniques.\nThe Sound\nPart of my passion for filmmaking comes from creating soundtracks. I'm determined to produce a unique sound design in which I can bring together the wide variety of musical talent in my artistic community. The sound will often drive the stories. Some soundtracks will be produced via the usual method of scoring after the final edit, but I will create some soundtracks before\u2014and even during\u2014the shoot. At least one of the stories will be a musical.\nBudget\nMy proposed budget of $6,000 (actually closer to $5000 after fees and fulfilling rewards) is the bare minimum for which I can realistically produce the 3 episodes. Making something as ambitious as this, that cheaply, is possible for a few reasons:\n\u2022 My years of experience in making visuals and sounds for little or no money.\n\u2022 New leaps in digital technology that allow filmmakers to produce and manipulate amazing quality, high-definition images with off-the-shelf consumer goods.\n\u2022 The ability of shooting entirely in my studio with a limitless variety of virtual sets.\n\u2022 Using recycling as a concept and aesthetic as well as an economical choice.\n\u2022 No cast or crew members will be paid. (This is the biggest difference between a micro-budget and a low-budget film.)\nIf we do raise more than the goal amount, the extra funding will be used to increase production values and expand the scope of the series. We may also get to film additional episodes for the first season and upgrade the reward packages to Blu-ray DVDs.\nAnd if we raise enough money, we might be able to compensate for the time and talent of the cast and crew.\nThe Budget Breakdown\nFundraising costs\n\u2022 Kickstarter and Amazon fees\n\u2022 Cost of creating and shipping contributor packages\nPre-production\n\u2022 Equipment upgrade\n\u2022 Props, costumes, miniatures, sets, background footage\nProduction\n\u2022 Craft services\n\u2022 Make up\n\u2022 Practical special effects\nPost-production\n\u2022 Hard drives / backup\nDistribution\n\u2022 DVDs\n\u2022 Packaging\n\u2022 Postage\n\u2022 Printing\n\u2022 Promotion\nBesides this Kickstarter campaign, there are ways you can help the project, especially if you live near Providence. Click here for more information.\nStay informed about the series through our official website: http://www.difficulttales.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs stated, the biggest challenge will be to produce an ambitious project on such a small budget. I feel confident that with my skills and those of my talented collaborators, we can pull this off. I have successfully finished many short films from start to finish with no planning or money\u2014sometimes in just 48 hours. With a bit of a budget, careful preproduction, and lots of hard work, we can make something totally unique. \n\nThe same digital revolution that has allowed filmmakers to create high-quality work with inexpensive equipment has also allowed their work to be distributed and seen worldwide, potentially by millions. Such ease of distribution has caused a glut of media. It is hard enough to get viewers to pay attention to free entertainment, let alone pay for their entertainment. This problem exists not only for independent creators, but also among major entertainment corporations. Once films are turned into digital files, they all have roughly the same value in the marketplace\u2014whether the production cost over $100 million or was made for pennies. The biggest difference is that the $100 million movie has $100 million to spend on promotion and advertising in order to bring it into the public consciousness. I certainly will not have a budget for promotion; I will put most of the money onscreen instead. I plan on making something totally unique and special that will stand out in the glut and build an audience through positive word-of-mouth instead of empty hype. You, the backers of this project, will be an important part of getting the word out. \n\nGiving much of the project away for free is an important part of this strategy. Today, all entertainment is exchanged for free, no matter how hard one tries to stop it. I plan to embrace this fact in order to get my work to a bigger audience. Having a way for people to support the project with paid downloads and DVDs (in addition to free distribution) seems the best option, especially if one gives an incentive to purchase the product by offering uncut and uncensored versions, bonus material, and special collectible packaging. \n\nIt should be stated that the packages that are being offered as rewards will be totally unique and collectible.\n\nTimetable\nIt might not be until May for funds to become available and I plan to use that month and much of June for organization, pre-production and testing. I plan to start shooting the first story near the end of June. I will release some of the first stories for free online as soon as they are finished, and continue to release them every few weeks to keep interest growing. The actual episode distribution might not happen until all three are finished and packaged as a DVD, depending on how we eventually work out dealing with the likes of iTunes, Amazon and Netflix (If you have any ideas and experience in these matters, please let us know.) The final package might not be done until late fall or early winter. Since this is a creative process, not the simple manufacturing of a product, there are factors that could delay production, including creative people who are not getting paid for their time.

The cards will be printed on 305 black core card stock with a plastic coating. \nThe Cards:\nWhy should you back Dragon\u2019s Hoard?\nDragon's Hoard is a fun interactive game where players get the chance to be immersed into a fantasy world where the roles are reversed. Instead of fighting a dragon, players play as a dragon. You will find a sense of satisfaction when you play Dragon\u2019s Hoard, and you will want to play it again and again. It\u2019s a beautifully illustrated game with a unique theme that is intuitive. Each player is searching the deck for valuable treasures. Drawing a beautiful damsel or a powerful wizard is exciting. Acquiring an expensive treasure is difficult, but rewarding. You will need to battle your opponents keeping them from playing actions against you. If you lose a treasure to an opponent, you will find yourself trying desperately to get it back. If you succeed and play the treasure as your own, it will be the talk of the game. When the game is done, you will sit with your friends and family, and everyone will want to share their experience of the game. Dragon\u2019s Hoard is a fun card game you can take anywhere. It is full of strategy, and very easy to learn. It is a great game to add to your collection.\nWritten Review by Cardboard Republic:\nhttp://www.cardboardrepublic.com/preview/dragons-hoard\nTom Vasel's Review:\nHow to Play the Game:\nWhere is the Money Going?\nPrinting: Most of the money raised will go to the printing of the game. I have contacted over a dozen card manufacturers, and have received numerous sample cards to ensure the highest quality. \nFinal Artwork: Some of the money will be used to create a breathtaking cover for the game box itself, illustrated by the gifted artist, Jonas Akerlund.\nShipping and Supplies: Shipping supplies will be an additional expense, and so I have factored in the materials I will need to ship my backers their rewards in top condition.\nKickstarter Rewards: A portion of the money will be put into special Kickstarter rewards, and additional enhancements to the game. \nBeautiful Damsels and Princes for Dragon's Hoard: If Dragon's Hoard raises more than the pledged amount, I will hire my artist to paint four new illustrations to enrich the game. At least one of the paintings will be of a prince. I would like to have several of the damsels in strong female roles as well, such as, warriors and rulers. Having unique illustrations will add to the value of winning each lovely damsel, and prince.\n4 of 5\nFive Ferocious Dragons for Dragon's Hoard: Once 14,000 dollars is raised, three new dragon illustrations will be added to the game. These additional dragons are destined to add fire to the magical world of Dragon's Hoard.\n3 of 5\nKickstarter Exclusive Unicorn Card: I would like to give my Kickstarter backers an exclusive card for their support. If we raise 15,000 dollars, I will add the unicorn card to the game. The unicorn allows a player to stay safe from actions like wizards, knights, and angry mobs for an entire round, and aids in the acquisition of a highly valuable treasure. \nFive Beautiful Lairs for Dragon's Hoard: When $18,000 is reached I'll have my artist paint four new lair illustrations. Lairs are valuable cards which give players bonus points at the end of the game. Having unique lairs will enhance the appeal of having multiple lairs, and will better shape the world of Dragon's Hoard.\n3 of 5\nTwo Piece Box for Dragon's Hoard: When Dragon's Hoard raises 22,000, every game will come in a strong two piece box. Not only will it improve the look of the game, but a two piece box will not break down as fast as a tuck box, and it will also protect the cards better. Below is an example of the box.\nCard Design Improvement: If Dragon\u2019s Hoard raises $30,000, I would like to rework the layout to make each card clearer, more beautiful, and shine in the fantasy universe. I believe the layout can be better, not only for those who struggle with color blindness, but for those who want to show this game to their friends and family for years to come. I will work with Jonas to bring the same quality of the illustrations to the card design.\nPlace Holder Image\nStart Card + Four Player Reference Cards: I want to add a total of five new cards. One will be a start card with the ending the game rules on the backside. Four of the cards will be player reference cards with unique dragon illustrations from the game on one side, and the action card descriptions on the other side. Adding these five cards will do two things. One, it will give the start player a new beautiful illustration to look at, and it will also make remembering who started the game apparent. Adding the player reference cards will not only allow the action cards to be text free, but will also give a dragon illustration to each player that may represent which dragon they are in the game. There will still be symbols on each action card in the game that clearly describe the action of the card.\nThick Durable Cards for Dragon's Hoard: My goal all along has been to continue making improvements to the game, so all who play it will enjoy it more. Printing the cards on 305 black core card stock with a plastic coating will strengthen the cards so you may play Dragon's Hoard more with less ware.\nNot a stretch goal.\nI want you all to know how much I appreciate your support. So, I've decided to send each and every backer a kickstarter only 3.5 by 5 inch card with a new unique illustration saying thank you for backing Dragon's Hoard. Again, my deepest thanks to all of you for supporting this project.\nSincerely, Nathanael\nFinished Illustrations:\nIllustrated by Jonas Akerlund\nA Word from the Designer:\nI love the way board games bring people together. I enjoy testing new game mechanics and have a deep appreciation for this developing art form. This is my first game, and a dream come true. I have worked with artists who have manifested my ideas into gorgeous artwork, designers who gave the artwork structure, and countless people who tested my game hundreds of times, refining it to perfection. \nAll that remains is to raise the funds needed to print the game and ship it to my backers. With your help, we can make Dragon's Hoard a reality. I worked hard to incorporate all my favorite attributes into this game. I have put all my cards on the table, and am sincerely grateful for your support.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs all the artwork is complete except for one Kickstarter exclusive character portrait and one cover illustration, I expect there to be few complications finishing the last illustrations. Jonas, the games illustrator, is simply amazing, and I do hope to raise more than the pledged amount so we may add some new illustrations to the game.\n\nAs for getting the game printed and shipped to each backer, I can't wait for that day. I have done a lot of research, and have sampled many cards from different manufacturers to ensure good quality components. I have, as well, several backup printers on my list should complications arise. I am, however, confident that once the game is backed it will be a smooth transition from printer to backer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #57", "update_userinfo": "The Big Reveal of My Second Board Game!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nI have some exciting news to share!

Each will be modeled as a promo miniature included in The Fortress pledge level as stretch goals are obtained. These fine characters have agreed to take up arms to support Greenbrier Games and the launch of Zpocalypse: Aftermath.\nMeet our Miniatures\nBrute: Standing at 5\u201911\u201d and weighing in at 235 pounds, Brick is almost as tall as he is wide, all of it muscle. He worked construction and in the lumber mills growing up. He might have continued to live the blue collar dream if it weren't for the end of days. Brick used his temper and his massive fists to get in and out of fights all his life. Now, getting his knuckles bloody could mean turning. He\u2019s taken to using a ball and chain- all of the satisfying bashing with no pesky infection. It could be love.\nEngineer: Meet Mac, girl genius from what was known as Southie. She stands 5\u20197\u201d and is a scrapper in a fight. Her deadliest weapon, however is her brain. In addition to being fluent in four languages, she has the uncanny knack of taking the scrap she finds and building precision machines of destruction. Her current toy is the military robot. She likes to call him Fido...Rover was too obvious. He\u2019s an excellent asset when building fortifications. He\u2019s also handy at tripping zombies, so she can kick them when they\u2019re down. With her trusty robot at her side and her Squad watching her back, she will rebuild this wasteland... or at least more effectively destroy it!\nScientist: Under the hazmat suit Dr. Kriegor is a slight man with a fearful intensity that belies his apparent lack of physical strength. His raw intelligence mixed with analytical skills and a lifetime of scientific inquiry at some of the finest institutions in the world make him a brilliant and terrible genius. He makes Mac seem like a vapid cheerleader. Of course his social skills are garbage. It seems strange how the team takes awfully good care of him. They even found him a 50 mm MGL that he has modified for \u201cfield testing.\u201d\nSurvivalist: When standing next to her team, Delphine looks like a pigmy. She is by far the slightest in size. Seeing as she spends much of her time tracking her prey and not wanting to be seen, this has its advantages. Even though she did eat some strange things growing up in Louisiana, for once she isn\u2019t interested in chowing down on her kill. Her compound bow is at her side, day and night. If you hear its quiet whisper, another poor undead soul is finally at rest.\nSandbag #1: In order to make this mountain of sandbags tires and wood with spikes someone had to lend a hand. Or a foot.\nSandbag #2: With a little bit of oil drum, wood whittled into spikes, razor wire and sandbags you too can have a fortification that will stop...er slow down, the zombie horde.\nGate: Made by the person in the bunker who had the most experience in construction this gate is solid. The zombie head adds a nice touch, Hopefully it tells them you are stone cold zombie killers. Worst case scenario, the smell of rot attracts them even more!\nWall #1: \u201cSomebody found a table saw and put the parts to good use! The axe may look for show but if you can\u2019t throw a zombie into those spikes and teeth, you may want to pull it out (carefully) and start hacking away!\u201d\nWall #2: Strapped together with razor wire this former iron gate mixed with mattresses and cement blocks is a solid as you can get in the badlands of Zpocalypse.\nWall #3: Cars are pretty much useless these days, so you might as well take the tires add some spikes and corrugated metal, wrap the whole thing with the thickest chain you can find and use it to keep your unhappy new home cozy.\nIn our previous Kickstarter we learned that shipping costs are not to be trifled with. Shipping to Kickstarter backers accounted for almost 26% of the projects costs. Shipping will be free for all Domestic USA. However we have to be realist about the costs to ship overseas. CND will be required to add $20. Those countries part of the EU, Australia, and New Zealand $40. Finally all others $50.  \nIn addition to the Aftermath miniature enhancements and fortifications, Greenbrier Games is also working on a fully fledged pen and paper RPG, Role Playing Game, set within the Zpocalypse universe. This involves converting the SRD, System Reference documents, from Wizards of the Coast's \"d20 modern\" system as well as Paizo Publishing's \"Pathfinder Roleplaying Game\" system. Both are based on the wildly successful d20 system of roll playing games. They were published under the OGL, Open Game License.  The Aftermath miniature packs are compatible with the upcoming Zpocalypse RPG!\nExternal Links\nhttp://greenbriergames.com/ | Main site\nhttp://forum.greenbriergames.com | Forum\nhttp://shop.gamesalute.com/search?q=greenbrier | GameSalute\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108665/zpocalypse | BGG\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zpocalypse | Facebook\nhttps://plus.google.com/102561121317928748777/posts   | Google+\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/zpocalypse | Reddit\nhttp://pinterest.com/greenbriergames/ | Pinsterest\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/GreenBrierGames | Twitter\nhttp://greenbriergames.tumblr.com/ | Tumblr\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/GreenBrierGames | Youtube\n\nOur team is dedicated to helping other projects and is active in participating in the http://kickingitforward.org initiative.

The world of Arena Rex is historically inspired, mythic in scope and legendary in proportion. Join us in bringing that world to life.\nThe Miniatures:\nThe miniatures we are creating are the heart of Arena Rex. At its core, this project is a way to get a line of exceptional gladiator miniatures out into the world. Every Arena Rex mini is a work of art, handmade by extraordinarily skilled artisans. We have some of the best sculptors in the world working on our models, and we put in a lot of effort to make sure they have what they need to capture the character of each piece. We then cast the sculpts in resin for a high-fidelity replica of the original. \nResin is the perfect medium for painters and collectors alike. Painters will love the detail captured on the models, and everyone else will appreciate how stunning our resin is in its natural state.\nCurrently, we have several minis  on sculptors' tables. We'll share them as they are completed. The purpose of this campaign is to fund the expansion of our miniatures line before the game launches.\nCharacter poses in concept art may be altered when they are translated from 2D to 3D. \nTOP: Urbicus by Valentin Zak - MIDDLE: Micon by Valentin Zak - BOTTOM: Noxius by Benoit Cauchies\nArena Rex is not affiliated with the other games or miniature lines listed above. Their models only appear here as a demonstration of scale. Aquila is on a 30mm base.\nThe Game:\nIf the miniatures are the heart that drives Arena Rex, our game system is the body, giving them added structure and purpose. With streamlined and innovative mechanics, Arena Rex is surprisingly simple to pick up and play, but still provides meaningful choices and is a lot of fun. The game's mechanics have been completed and polished. Right now we are completing final balancing of our individual gladiators. The summer playtest will allow backers at the Ludus level and higher to preview the full version of the game and provide feedback on clarity of rules text and any final rule tweaks.\nA skirmish-style game with a low model count is a natural fit for gladiatorial arenas. It also allows us to work in more interesting characters and mechanics without worrying about game play becoming too unwieldy. It's easy to get into Arena Rex -- three models per side is an excellent a starting point.\nThe World:\nThe world and setting are the soul of Arena Rex: those things which give it character and identity. The rumor and superstition that are pervasive through accounts of the ancient world have been writ large in Arena Rex, and a keen sense of wonder is a key element that we wanted to include in the world. Inspired by the most exciting eras of antiquity, we have taken some anachronistic liberties and changed some key historical points to create a world that is both familiar and incredible. \n The Roman Republic endures on the shores of the Mediterranean, while across the Alps, the Gallo-Roman Empire holds sway. The kingdom of Aegyptus is a tributary of the Roman Republic and ruled directly by an Antonian king and Ptolemaic queen.

HAVE NO FEAR! You can still follow our progress and donate on our website. <3\nwww.teampixelpi.com\nUpdate #6 - Plushie Add-ons, Shirts, and DRM news!\nAvailable for WINDOWS, MAC and LINUX\nPulse is a first-person experiential journey in which you are blind. Using a process similar to echolocation, you use sounds in the environment to create a mental reconstruction of the world around you. The character has not been blind since birth, and is therefore able to pull memories from their childhood to \"see\" the environment.\nPulse, early prototype screenshot\nThroughout your journey, you will encounter creatures called Mokos whose sole desire is to help you. By using the noise these creatures make, they provide additional \"vision\" when in need. They also provide superfluous amounts of cuteness. In contrast, there are also terrifying creatures who seek to devour you. Listen carefully and avoid these beasts at all costs.\nYou're not alone...\nIn this synesthesia-like experience, your world will shift and become clearer based on the information provided by your senses. There is often a distinct difference between what you \"see\" versus what is actually there. Let your senses guide you.\nFor the prototype of Pulse, we focused on three main design pillars:\nChallenge - We believe challenge and difficulty are two very different beasts, and they do not necessarily exist hand in hand. We want to engage players, not test them. There are amazing things to be said about completing a difficult game, but Pulse isn\u2019t about proving you can make it to the end; it\u2019s about feeling like you accomplished something worthwhile in getting there.\nPulse, early concept\nDiscovery - We've dropped the player in the world with little to no information about their surroundings. Since vision is not readily available to the player they must rely on their other senses to piece together what they\u2019re seeing. We are able to create \u201clayers of discovery\u201d on objects or entire environments, which makes the world constantly change based on your new level of understanding.\nSensation - Limiting the information players have traditionally relied on gave us the opportunity to give them a different way to experience their environment. Though we never intended to recreate the experience of being blind we invite the player to imagine what it would mean to rely on their other senses for information and guidance.\nWe are five game designers and developers from a multitude of backgrounds, ranging from Brazil, to the United States, to all over Canada, eh? We bring to the table years of experience in Fine Arts, Design and Computer Sciences, with degrees in all three subjects.\nAfter completing these degrees and working in our respective fields for some time, we all moved to the west coast to study in the Vancouver Film School Game Design program. This is where we met, formed our team, and went on to develop our final student project: Pulse.\nNow that we've graduated and moved into the games industry, we want nothing more than to reunite the team with our refined skills and embark on another game development adventure together.\nWhen we started Pulse as a student project, we set out to challenge ourselves. We wanted to bring to the table a special kind of gaming experience; one that was more than just fun, one that was emotionally engaging. We still have that same goal: exploring beyond the fun in games, and seeing how they're capable of affecting players in different ways.\nThe response to it has been overwhelming. We've had the opportunity to watch others discover the world through our characters eyes. As a student project we took this concept as far as we could, but there is so much more to explore - We want to take our prototype to the next level.\nIndependent game development has come a long way since the birth of video games -- in large part due to the recent involvement of Kickstarter. It has been an incredibly positive force in allowing creativity to flow from \u201cthe little guy\u201d, and get it into the hands of players around the world.\nIndividually, we\u2019ve all backed numerous projects on Kickstarter, and we\u2019ve seen the amazing results. Now we're on the other end of that. We can deliver, we just need a bit of help.\nBy backing us, you're helping us overcome the upfront costs for development. Specifically:\nPurchasing the software licenses - Our prototype was created using educational software licences that were made available to us through our school. We need to purchase professional licences to move forward with the project.\nGame audio, studio recording and soundtrack - While at VFS we had access to an amazing sound team and recording studio. To maintain the quality level we were able to achieve in the prototype we will need access to these facilities and in the real world they don't come cheap.\nLegal junk - We need to get the usual legal stuff out of the way so that we are protected and can focus on the game.\nYour rewards for being awesome!\nAn ice cream machine*\n*Note: we're not actually buying an ice cream machine.\nIncredible amounts of THANK YOU for taking the time to check out our project!\nMusic used in video: Revert by Rataxes under the CC Attribution license.\nTeam Pixel Pi is participating in Brian Fargo's Kicking it Forward program.

The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.  \nOdin's Ravens is a two player board game, originally published in Germany, garnishing praise for its lively card duels and replay value.  The game has been out of print for over a decade and fetches high second-hand prices. \nWorks Ltd. is proud to present to Kickstarter the newly revised Second Edition of Odin's Ravens by Thorsten Gimmler.\nTHE GAME\nComponents:  \n40 Midgard cards\n25 Hugin flight cards\n8 Hugin action cards\n25 Munin flight cards\n8 Munin action cards\n2 Raven meeples \nRulebook\nCards are laid out from the Midgard deck to form the shifting and flowing landscape that the ravens will race over.  Each raven has two decks to draw their hand from, flight cards and action cards.  Flight cards allow the raven to proceed down the path.  Action cards are used to manipulate the path, boost your raven, or throw your opponent for loops.  Each raven must race to the end of the path and then return on the opposite side, so timing your actions is crucial.\nPlease watch our game introduction video for more info on gameplay:\nSECOND EDITION\nIn the decade since it was first published, Thorsten Gimmler has revised the original game rules.  The changes have been introduced to streamline teaching the game to new players and to simplify the end game, without sacrificing the challenge or choices available during play.  This makes the game quicker to get to the table and easier to score.\nCOMPONENTS\nWe have decided to launch the Odin's Ravens Kickstarter project with the component quality maxed out, rather than have stretch goals to upgrade subpar components later.  We are proud of this game and want it to ship to you with lasting, high quality components right out of the box. \nThe raven meeples are custom made from New Zealand pine.  The cards will be 300gsm bluecore casino quality with linen embossing.  The box will be made with UV coated art paper stock to stand the test of time.  Full color rule book with detailed illustrations and a color printed box insert to organize the bits.  \nCard size will be standard Euro/Dominion size, if you would like to sleeve them.\nSTRETCH GOAL\nWe have added a stretch goal at $17,500!  Works, Ltd. is partnering with app developer JoubleDump LLC to bring Odin's Ravens to the iOS!  If we can meet the stretch goal, we will be delivering an iOS copy of the game to everyone who has backed at the $25 level or higher. Development is currently in a preliminary stage, but we are aiming to deliver the app in Fall of 2013, pending a successful Kickstarter. The app will offer Single Player mode with two difficulty settings, Pass & Play on one device, and Game Center support for two player mode.\n\nTHORSTEN GIMMLER\nThorsten Gimmler is a game designer and electrical engineer from Berlin, Germany.  He is the author of the games No Thanks! (BGG #310), Aton (BGG #407), The Thief of Baghdad (BGG #1209) and others.  His first game was published in 1999.  In 2007, The Thief of Baghdad was nominated for the Spiel des Jahres.\nEXCLUSIVE REWARDS\nA Kickstarter exclusive, 12\"x18\" wide format art print of the game's cover painting printed on premium 9mil photobase matte paper, suitable for framing.

A 1v1 game might be over in 15 minutes, but the more players you add, the longer and more complex the game becomes!\nThe Corporate Wars box set with all included elements.\nHull Breach Corporate Wars comes in a box set with: \n3 fully-playable-right-out-of-the-box decks\n10 ten-sided dice\n20 Explosion/wound tokens\n10 Jammer tokens\n10 Target painter tokens\n10 Economy gems\nRulebook \nFiction supplement, an introduce to the story behind the Corporate Wars\nEverything you need to play will be in the box! Even though this isn't a CCG, you can still tear down your decks and reassemble it with any number of combinations of cards that you can think of and forge your own playstyle!\nWe've already brought an Alpha version of our game to market in New England, proving that the concept works and people are hungry for more.  We've taken fan feedback gathered during that run (rules, tweaks, art, packaging, and more) and applied it to our next phase - Corporate Wars!  It's bigger, better and shinier than ever before, and ready for a nationwide release!\nHere's a video we shot at The Game Den in Warren, R.I., explaining a little more about the key points of the game.\nThe goal of the game is to capture or destroy your enemy's space station and defend your own. How exactly you choose to do that is up to you, but you'll be able to leverage many different types of cards towards that end. \nEach Commander starts the game with a space station in play.  From there, you draw cards, manage your per-turn income, and balance your offensive and defensive production against that of your opponents. To do this, you'll draw up to five cards every turn and tally up your per-turn economic gain, which depends on how you configure your station.  Are you a financial powerhouse, or do you focus on military strength at your station?\nAfter that, you'll be able to deploy ships, Marines, and equipment that modifies them to bolster your forces.\nYou can then launch your fleet across the stars at your opponent - once your forces arrive in his sector of space you have two main methods of destroying him: use your Marines to board and seize his ships and station, or use your raw firepower to turn those same ships and station into twisted wrecks!\nThere are many classes of ships, ranging from tiny drones to enormous capital ships, each with its own strengths and weaknesses - some excel at confronting enemies head-on while others are relied on to perform vital support tasks in combat. \nWhen you're not slinging dice and destroying ships like a pro, you can also use slightly more devious methods to defeat your enemies!  Powerful Event and Tactic cards can tip the balance of power dramatically, either by manipulating economies and production or implementing clever battle strategies to influence combat results.\nBut Hull Breach! strategy goes beyond the cards and the dice.  Your own command abilities will factor significantly into your success or failure!  Knowing when to strike, what to strike, and how to strike are the marks of a truly great Commander.\nDon't take our word for it; here's a great video review by the good folks at Skip the Rules!\nIf you want more detailed info about the Alpha rules and the Corporate Wars rules check out our website!  \nHere you'll find our Pledge Tier levels.

If you pledged to tier 3 or higher you will receive your game 2 full weeks before it hits store shelves!\n3 months after that we will release the first of our 3 Hull Breach games introducing the ancient and mysterious alien race- The Alarians. Those 3 games will have new cards and gameplay styles while still being competitive with the Human decks you'll already own.\n\nSo what does this all look like?

It's easy to learn, supports deep strategy, and allows 2 to 4 players. Most importantly, it's fun.\nGameplay\nThe playing field is the timeless checkered board. The pieces are double-sided discs with directionality. Pieces can capture each other chess-style, and be promoted from minions to masters.\nEach piece has a direction it can travel - up-down or left-right. The twist is that every time a piece moves, it rotates 90 degrees when it lands, changing its direction. Hence the name: Pivit.\nBasic pieces, called minions, must move to a square of a different color. So if they start on a black square, they must land on a white square. Promoted pieces, called masters, may land anywhere along their line. Pieces cannot jump each other, and they capture by landing on an enemy-occupied square. These are all of Pivit's movement rules.\nGames can be as fast as a half hour when 2 people play on a 6x6 board, and over an hour when 4 players use an 8x8 board. (Both boards are included.)\nThe fun of Pivit is that you can see how well you're doing, and you can feel the threat of capture as positions flow. It's a visceral game. It's easy to pick out paths to victory, but the obvious journeys are fraught with the peril of enemy firepower.\nOur Story\nMy name is Tyler, and I'll tell you the origin story of the Pivit team.\nFirst, some background: I love beautiful ideas. While studying math in grad school, I did things like build a Tetris clone for my fellow grad students, and helped start an annual program called cSplash to teach fun ideas to high school students. Earlier this year, I made a site called The Cost of Knowledge to support open access publishing of research. I love the fun of Lego, and last year created a popular set of 50 Designs with 50 Pieces. These are not games, but for me are motived by the creativity and freedom of ideas.\nThe first idea for Pivit came from another game I was working on. I stumbled upon the minion movement rule that combines cool properties of bishops and rooks from chess. Even though bishops all move the same way, along diagonals, there are two types of them since a bishop on a black square can never attack a bishop on a white square. The movement rule in Pivit similarly splits pieces into two types, but it's more subtle because every Pivit piece can eventually get to every square. This piqued my curiosity. I decided to visit a few game universes with these rules of physics, and the journey for Pivit began.\nMany hours of playtesting and tweaking confirmed there was a good game here. I wanted to share the game beyond my playtester friends, so I described the project to Ivan, an industrial designer. He tried out the game and jumped at the chance to design the physical pieces. He invited Tim, a graphic designer, to join us. Tim created the logo and worked with us on the overall visual style. Finally, we brought in Dave, a mechanical engineer, to ensure top quality work from the manufacturing process.\nHow a minion will be made\nThroughout the design of the game, we held one principle above all: elegance. The rules are deceivingly simple, so the pieces and logo appear almost minimalistic. Yet implicit in each is a hidden complexity, waiting to be discovered. Each piece hides its own inverse - the master it yearns to become. Even the logo holds a secret. At first glance, it's just a word, yet when you turn it upside-down, the glyph stares back at you right-side-up -- a nod to the revolutions at the heart of the game.\nInspiration: Emergent Complexity\nA mathematician named John Conway came up with a set of simple rules for a 2D world of cells that evolve with time. This is called Conway's Game of Life, and it's a mind-bendingly beautiful demonstration of how surprisingly complex patterns can emerge from simple rules.\nThe rules for Conway's game of life, and a snapshot of a world evolving\nThis mathematical evolution of cells looks and feels like a colony of microscopic organisms frantically wobbling about a digital Petri dish. You could spend a lifetime studying the different types of creatures, their personalities, and the surprising ways they interact.\nSome games capture emergent complexity like this. Tetris is a great example. You can understand the mechanics and the goal in seconds. What follows is an exciting phase of intuition-building where you gradually get better at it.\nThis is the inspiration for Pivit - transparent mechanics than enable intuitive thinking and play. \nFly Casual\nEuro-games like Dominion, Agricola, or Race for the Galaxy are popular among my friends and the gaming community at large. At first glance, Pivit seems at odds with the current trends in board games. But there is something it has in common: it's a casual game for small groups.\nClassic abstract games are typically built for only two players. The best ones, like Go, are intense. Pivit aims for a sweet spot that's thoughtful and exciting, but not stressful. It works well with four players - it's social. And it can be played quickly if you like fast games.\nIn short, Pivit is great for game nights.\nTeh Codez (the software version)\nThe software version of Pivit (Mac or Windows) lets you enjoy the full gameplay. It includes an AI opponent and supports multiperson play among the humans.\nA prototype version of the software, including a working AI opponent, already exists. Some work still remains. The user interface is incomplete, and you can currently only play against the AI, not other humans (yet).\nThe software is being built for desktop/laptop machines, and not tablets like the iPad, because it is processor-intensive. In a 4-player game, thinking 3 rounds ahead (so 12 total moves) with 10 choices per move gives a think-ahead tree with 1 trillion branches. The AI needs as much CPU as it can get, and tablet speeds are far behind laptops and desktops.\nLike many board games, there's something about Pivit that makes it more exciting to play in real life. If you get the software, I think you'll really enjoy it. If you get the physical game, I think you'll be even happier.\nThe Physical Game\nHere is what you get with your copy of Pivit:\nA game board that supports either 6x6 or 8x8 board sizes.\nGame instructions.\n40 playing pieces in 4 colors.\nThe elite package will also contain a print that's signed by the Pivit team (Ivan, Tim, Dave, and Tyler). If we reach our stretch goal of $100k, then elite package contributors will also receive a collector's set of pieces in the fifth playing color. (This doesn't enable 5-player games.) All other contributors receive the base set of four playing colors.\nOur Costs\nThe largest one-time (not per-game) cost for us will be tooling costs in the injection molding process used to manufacture the game pieces. We have not yet committed to a manufacturer, so that the exact value of this cost is unknown, but it is likely to be in the general range of $10,000 - $15,000. If we sell our base goal of 1,000 games, this leaves us about $35/unit to cover all per-game costs, including: custom boxes, printed instructions, cost of piece materials and assembly, international shipping and tariffs, and game boards.\nWe based our projected costs on early quotes we received from a few potential manufacturers. Selling many games enables lower per-game costs, but it also requires a higher funding goal. We chose our rewards and goals to minimize the game price while keeping what we hope is an achievable funding goal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe expect the biggest challenges to be in the manufacturing process. There are many details to take into account, especially since we are committed to producing a high quality product. These details include quality of the mold used for the game pieces, quality of piece assembly, and board and box printing quality. If we manufacture outside the US, then we will also have to contend with tariffs, potential pallet-based shipping, and possible customs delays.\n\nLuckily, our team has experience working through these details, so we're confident that we'll be able to ship something that meets both our high standards and yours.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Tyler Neylon\nFirst created \u00b7 32 backed\nI love games and playing with ideas.

AND THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS!\nDreadline is a high intensity, single player*, action role playing/real time strategy mashup. You control an unlikely and eclectic group of monsters killing the doomed during historically-inspired catastrophes.**\n* If we can raise enough money, we would love to add multiplayer!\n** Dreadline will be DRM-Free.\nDreadline is the kind of game you make when you don't have to convince anybody other than yourself that it's going to be awesome. A kid with a sheet over his head and a kitchen knife who thinks he's a ghost? What if he wore a backpack filled with a harvest of human hearts? His best friends consist of mummies, monsters, and a magical flying cube with incredible powers? Dreadline is mysterious, curious, cute, violent, and strange. We're following our instincts, not a spec developed by a team of marketing experts.\nThe game revolves around our main character, Ghost. He's an 8 year old boy with a bit of a troubled past. He was saved by a group of misfit monsters who were given a time machine by a highly educated alien from the future. What could go wrong?\nWe started out with one goal in mind... to take the RTS/RPG gameplay that you love, and make it way faster paced and frantic. You start each level by picking a team of 3 monsters to accompany Ghost as he \"visits\" calamities throughout time. (It would be far less civilized to kill people who weren't going to die anyway, no?) Each playable monster will have a unique and crazy skill set. We have a cool new interface for controlling your monsters (codenamed \"dreadlines!\"), an insanely competitive leaderboard system for keeping stats so you can compete with friends, and an awesome new game engine that makes the game look unlike anything else out there.\nWe are industry vets, but please don't hold that against us! We've worked on  dozens of games over the years, from first person shooters, to ARPGs, to the biggest music games ever made. (Freedom Force, Bioshock, Titan Quest, Rock Band, etc.) What we haven't had the opportunity to do is make a game that is truly our own. Unfortunately, so many of the best ideas we ever heard were left on the cutting room floor of AAA developer's offices. Those flashes of inspiration should add up to more. We have both the expertise to build this game, and the vision and creativity to make sure we don't get lost along the way.\nDreadline is the kind of project that we've always dreamed of making.\nWe have been toiling in obscurity for the better part of a year, shaking off the residue from our old day jobs, finding the right project, and getting it ready to present to the world. Our hard work has paid off. The response to what tidbits of the game we've shown to people has been fantastic. We've laid the groundwork for building an incredible, one-of-a-kind game that we couldn't be more excited to build.\nIt took quite a bit longer for us to get to this point than we anticipated. As the project developed, our vision for what it could be grew and grew. What was originally going to be our quick-turnaround/low-risk/easy-breezy/genre game evolved into a completely original game that is far more exciting, but also far more challenging to build. Now that we're ready to really get down to building this thing, we're out of cash. We have enough of it up and running to know that it's going to be ridiculously fun, and we can't wait to finish it.\nWe're fortunate to have arrived here at the perfect time. Kickstarter has proven that there is an amazing audience of people ready to support projects like ours. \nDreadline is currently slated to be an English-language, single-player, PC release that will be completed around August of 2013. The plan is to have 9 playable monsters and 7 calamities. We have estimated that it will cost us $167,000 (minus the take of Kickstarter, Amazon, and our prizes) to get Dreadline out the door. It's quite a bit less than what other game projects of this size have asked for since we've been self funding for over a year now.\nBut we would love to offer more. We want more monsters, more calamities, multiplayer monster fights, Mac port, iOS port, more languages, or anything else YOU may want. We don't want to put up a table of new features that could be rolled out yet, because we would first like to hear from people like you.\nPeople are clamoring for more Dreadline cartoons! We are planning on building animated cinematics very much like our teaser trailer for the game. Even a short and sloppy animation like that takes a serious amount of work. More money would mean that we can make more, better, and more ridiculous cartoons. \nEerie Canal is about creativity, independence, and innovation. We want to continue to make games that nobody else can.\nWe have built our entire game engine, entitled \"shoe_gazer\", from the ground up to make Dreadline. When we first started on the game, we weren't sure what we wanted it to look like. We just knew that we loved Steven's concept art, and after a while, decided that we should try to make our game look like his sketches. Having our own technology allows the game to look unlike anything else out there while also giving us the ability to add any of the ridiculous features we can dream up. Additionally, it supports all of the functionality you've come to love in other games (use of multiple cores, particle systems, cool physics, 2d/3d sounds, networking, etc.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo game development is a risky process fraught with peril. Just think of how many AAA titles with huge budgets end up getting canned. (Steven and Bryn should know, they worked on a project for a few years at Irrational Games that never saw the light of day.)\n\nDreadline has a number of things going for it that will keep it from becoming just another forgotten game.\n\n1- All members of the team are game industry veterans. Bryn and Steven have been the lead programmer and lead artist on projects at Irrational Games, Harmonix, and Iron Lore Entertainment.\n\n2- Dreadline has been under development for over a year. Although we have a lot of work left to do, the game engine is up and running, and the game is playable. (Just look at the footage from the video!)\n\nHonestly, the main thing we are missing right now is funding. We have developed the title for as long as we could, and are now basically flat broke. Although we joked about it, we have actually put a very detailed plan/schedule into place and know exactly how much more money we need to finish Dreadline. That's what we're asking for.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Eerie Canal\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed\nEerie Canal is an independent game studio based in Boston, MA, and Providence RI.

I originally wrote what is known as a \u201cdeferred renderer\u201d that works a bit like the Unreal and Unity engine. Unfortunately, we weren't really feeling it. At one point Steve remarked that the Titanic looked a bit like an old school Metal Gear level.\nI spent some time looking at Steve's concepts, which tend to be very loose and have an amazing childlike innocence to them. I thought it would be cool to be able to play as a group of rampaging monsters in a world that looked like Steve's cute but twisted fairy tale illustrations.

To this I've rescanned and personally color corrected all the artwork (including previously published images) to bring the paintings to life as close to the originals as possible -- 400 dpi files and the finest dot screens on the highest quality papers to assure the clearest, cleanest reproductions.\u201d\nJohn Fleskes adds: \u201cHaving the opportunity to work closely with Brom will ensure the colors and tones properly reflect how he wants his artwork to be shown. We are combining his artistic abilities with my ten years of publishing experience to create a book that serves as a work of art in itself. It\u2019s very exciting to be involved in a project such as this: one that will challenge us both, and one that must meet our combined criteria for excellence.\"\nSample Brom Art Included in \"The Art of Brom\"\nBrom\u2019s thoughts on Flesk Publications:\n\u201cPublishing is not the easiest way to make a living in this day and age, you have to love books. John Fleskes loves books, loves publishing -- giving up a stable career to pursue this passion. I admire that. I also admire that he only publishes books that he would wish to buy, only artists whose work he admires. Publishing is a very personal matter with him and it shows in his attention to detail, his dedication to bringing the highest production values possible to every book. John promotes the arts through quality collections. I feel very fortunate to be working with him on my book.\u201d\nJohn Fleskes\u2019 thoughts on Brom:\n\u201cBrom's art is in a constant stage of evolution. In his early work his subjects tended to exemplify strength and power. Brom\u2019s recent work draws more from the pre-Raphaelite vein\u2014darkly romantic and classical. In \u201cThe Art of Brom,\u201d we focus not on a single viewpoint, but encompass the growth of a career; the ongoing evolution of an artist. Furthermore, Brom the person is a delight. Even though he categorizes himself as a \"dark\" artist, he is far from dark in person. He has a passion for life and is fun to work with.\u201d\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\u201cKickstarter is a wonderful way to have a personal connection with those supporting my work,\" says Brom. \"As well as a chance to offer an array of unique personalized items that won't be available in stores. On a more personal note, it's a heck of a fun platform to promote on.\"\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d adds John. \u201cKickstarter is an exciting way to get back to my roots of being a fan, the very thing that pushed me to get started publishing, and build a connection with other like-minded people and reward them with bonus material for supporting us early on. Brom and I are basically looking to reward the fans and give them a stunning book--the very thing we would want for ourselves.\u201d\nA final message from Brom:\n\u201cMost importantly, regardless of whether you contribute to this project or not, I would like to take this opportunity to thank any and all of you that have enjoyed and shared my work over the years. Painting can be very solitary endeavor at times and I am continually moved to discover that my work touches others. I would also like to say I am forever grateful to be able to pursue my muse for a living -- something I could not do without your support. Again, thank you.\"\nSample Brom Art Included in \"The Art of Brom.\" This book will house an assortment of Brom's art covering his entire career.\nSample Brom Art Included in \"The Art of Brom\"\nFor more samples of Brom's artwork, please visit www.bromart.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Flesk Publications at the LA Ultimate Comic Art & Collectibles Show and SDCC", "update_content": "Hi All,\nFlesk Publications will be at the LA Ultimate Comic Art & Collectibles Show on Sunday July 15th, 2018 at the LAX Hilton.

Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others.

I hope this goes through, not just for the action figure, but to see kids play with heroes from the past that I've come to love.\"     - Harrison Montgomery\n\"An awesome project guys! Love the concept AND the execution. Doing my part to spread the word.\"     - Jon Wesley Huff\n\"It's not just about selling action figures, it's about culture, education and heritage. Go, go, dynamo!\"       -Tey Beng Huan\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF HEROES\nFor many years, we've been making the toys that you and your kids play with from Star Wars to Pokemon, from Beyblade to Jurassic Park.  Sometimes, it's easy to write-off action figures as toss-away replicas of whatever movie that might be hot at the moment. But action figures play an important role in children's social development. They are pathways for kids to act out their fantasies, to work out for themselves the differences between right and wrong and to push at the boundaries of their blossoming imaginations.\nHero stories play that very same role in our societal development. They inspire us to reach higher, walk taller and overcome our daily challenges. Their stories bring us together in ways that no other medium can. They are the source code for what makes us human. Who are your heroes?\nA CALL TO ACTION\n\"Why are there no toys of the great epics of India?\"  Asked casually at a neighborhood get-together, those words posed a very powerful question. Not just about the Indian epics, but about all world stories. \nWhy ARE modern stories treated with more importance than our traditional stories? Do regional heroes like Beowolf, Quetzalcoatl, Alibaba, or Monkey deserve anything less than to be brought to life in vivid technicolor using the same level of care, quality and vibrancy of Spider-man or Darth Vader?\nThe universe had presented us an opportunity for a adventure of our own. Kids  should have the opportunity to discover these stories for themselves. It was a calling that we just had to answer. And so, the Hero Project was born.\nTOY ECONOMICS 101\nMaking an action figure is more complex than most people might imagine. Right up until launch the biggest question we got from anyone we showed was, \"Why is your funding goal ($125,000) so high?\"  \nThe answer is threefold- scale, complexity and quality.  The steel molds used to reproduce a figure are expensive and that expense grows exponentially with scale, complexity and quality. A small and simple Pokemon item may cost $5000 to make a mold, $15,000 for Batman or Ninja Turtles figure, and upwards of $30K for most larger scale figures. Ordering a sizable batch of large, multi-part figures is costly and like most people we know, neither of us has an extra large bundle of C-notes sitting around to front the capital.\nAfter a lot of investigation, we decided that crowdfunding was probably the best way forward. We'd go straight to the people, tell them about what we'd built and let them champion it. The idea would live or die with folks like you!!!\nA PROJECT OF HEROIC PROPORTIONS\nA great action figure should inspire kids to pick it up and invest their imaginative energy into telling their own epic stories of good vs. evil, personal challenges, and saving the day.\nWe wanted to produce an item that could deliver a singular, awe-inspiring, hands-on experience.  We also wanted to consider mold reuse and material efficiencies as much as possible. We decided to build a single universal body (UniBody) that would capture the raw, iconic essence of heroism.\nThis single body would allow us to make Rama, who we wanted to be our introductory figure, but like GI Joe and Barbie before it, we'd re-use the molds from the basic body and supplement with new molds to create other characters in the future. \nTHE VIRTUES OF RAMA\n\nCulturally, Rama was the best place to start. He is the perfect embodiment of the value and majesty of the world's cultural stories. The Ramayana is an amazingly magical story, loved around the world. Like many modern fantasies, it's filled with magical beings, vile demons, an epic journey through exotic locales, and an earth-shaking final battle. But, it is also a tale filled with the human stories that sometimes get overshadowed with bombast- acts of duty, honor, faith, devotion, that exemplify what Rama, as a hero and role model mean to billions. He typifies the Heroic Ideal.\nThe challenge of bringing him to life was daunting. Each person has his or her own relationship with the Ramayana and being true to each is nearly impossible. We redesigned him many times. What started out as a somewhat westernized or classical approach over time evolved to incorporate an aesthetics that was more grounded in the east. What we decided is that we need to design him for both the people who already know and love Rama, but also the people who have yet to meet him. Where we ended up, hopefully is something timeless, that can appreciated by the entirety of the world.\nRAMA: THE FIGURE\n\nOn an artistic level, Rama conveys that sense of heroic 'presence' that we felt was essential. We balanced that artistic value with the functional needs of a consumer product, it needed to be long-lived, something of heirloom quality that could be passed from child-to-child and stylistically stand the test of time.\nPoseability- We've built Rama using a special technique to avoid ugly pin joints that can be distracting to the character. At 31 points of movement, our design gives him incredible poseability and balance when standing. \n\nAccessories- One of the most important reasons we chose the 8 inch scale is the playability of the accessories. Rama's bow will fire his arrows like a real-scale working bow. His arrows are designed after the various magical and elemental archery techniques portrayed in his adventures. Each is engraved with the Sanskrit words for each power.\nFact card- Rama comes with a 5x7 fact card which will introduce kids to him via story bits, friends, foes, skills and characteristics of his specific brand of heroism.\nThe package- As a toy designer, one of the hardest decisions is to take fun details and accessories out of one of your products to spend it on the package. You understand the package's importance for kids trying to make a hard choice in the figure aisle, but you also know that it's just going straight into the garbage when they get home. Our main goal was to reduce the amount of packaging material as much as possible to ensure that the figure itself carried the bulk of total product value. This package was built to be our 'mailer'. All the figures purchased in the $35 reward level, will receive their figure in the mail packaged as shown below.\n\nA GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE\nAlthough we've started this journey with Rama, what got us really excited about the project is all the new heroes that we discovered during our research. The deeper we dug, the more excited we became about the vast array of great characters. Getting that rich diversity of heroes into kid's hands is the ultimate promise of the The Hero Project, exposing kids to the vastness of great hero stories from around the world. \nSheRoes of the world!\nAbove are two line-ups of possible heroes and demigods that we'd love to develop in the future. See any you recognize? Don't see your favorite?  You can see more of these figures in the 'Updates' tab above. You can vote for your favorites or suggest characters via our Male Character Poll and Female character poll. We have huge plans for the future. Help us make it happen!\nExplore the world through it's heroes!\nTHE DESIGNERS\nTucker Johnson\nGrowing up outside of Pittsburgh to a family of artists, Tucker planted the seeds for his cultural curiosity with weekends spent at the Carnegie museum. He cultivated those interests through college by spending every academic credit on eastern religion and culture courses. After working in advanced concepts for General Motors, design at Hasbro, and as a consultant to major media and toy companies, he sees The Hero Project as the fruition of all his past experience.\nWayne Losey\nWayne grew up loving stories of heroes, monsters and worlds undreamed-off. He started illustrating comics at the age of 18, where he enjoyed appearing at comic conventions across the country, promoting his work and talking to people about their passions. After a successful career at Hasbro Toys and founding Dynamo Development Labs with Tucker, he's looking forward to putting out some fun products of his own and continuing that creative discussion.\nEPIC REWARD ITEMS\nOne of the greatest challenges of doing this Kickstarter was coming up with rewards that complimented the figure. We'd been researching product-on-demand solutions for some other personal projects using Shapeways and Ponoko. These seems the smartest way to avoid over-committing to more tooling and inventory. It really allowed us to provide some great incentives for the escalating reward packages. Our goal was to provide something for everyone.\nIn addition to the product rewards shown in each package, every backer at or above the $30 pledge level will receive some additional perks. These benefits include- voting privileges on our 'character advisory board', where you can help us determine which future characters we will pursue, access to project art and wall papers, a members-only portal into the design, manufacturing and fulfillment process for this and future items and a special prize!- 15% off any future Hero Project figures.\nThe Paper Doll set\nGear up Rama for his various adventures! This features a wide variety of options including several parts not available in the figure itself.\nThe commemorative Hero Project T-shirt\nA pre-shrunk cotton Hero Project t-shirt, printed on navy and available in all adult and kids sizes.\nThe Rama T-shirt\nA pre-shrunk cotton Rama: Hero Project t-shirt, printed on navy and available in all adult and kids sizes.\nThe softcover Rama Storybook\nAn illustrated (and abbreviated) telling of Rama's adventures. 24 color pages of story and activities that introduce kids to Rama, his allies, foes and journey.\nThe hardbound 'Art of the Hero Project' Book\nA commemorative hard bound book collecting of all the preliminary design work leading up to the figure and Kickstarter campaign. This 32 page full-color book contains figure development art, Rama-inspired works by professional illustrators, designers and  friend of the project, including Triclops Robotboy, Stephanie Swanson, James Groman, Michael O'Hare, Galen McKamy, Ben Hitmar, The Tarantulas, and BJ Johnson and most importantly, it will detail the names of all project contributors and backers like you!\nThe limited-edition, 'Kickstarter-only' Alabaster figure- \nWe're offering a limited-run of 100 'Kickstarter-only' exclusive figures. These will have the same high-quality detailing of the basic figure, but presented in an 'alabaster' white motif, inspired by classical sculpture. This figure will come with its own version of the figure display stand listed below, but each version of the stand will be numbered (1-100) for authenticity.\nThe laser-cut and etched Figure Display Stand- We wanted to produce something that would allow users to display the figure in their homes. Each display is individually cut and printed and shipped to you flat for easy assembly.\nTO OUR INTERNATIONAL FRIENDS\nIf you live in a country where you cannot donate directly to Kickstarter the current best option is to buy a prepaid amazon cash card and use that for your donation. You must add $1 more than the prize amount to make sure the donation goes through.

If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the cities growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals and win election.\n\nIn Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayors grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try and take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy.\n\nTammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the cities immigrant populations. While the organization\u2019s influence spanned from its founding in the 1790\u2019s to its collapse in the 1960\u2019s this game is set during the height of Tammany\u2019s power roughly between 1850 and 1870, the era of Boss Tweed. The game board is based on a map of Lower Manhattan in New York. The actual physical location of Tammany Hall moved several times through its history and one more time for the sake of our game.\n\nTammany Hall has been called a \u201cHoly Grail\u201d game by many gamers due to its great reputation and extremely limited availability.  Only 500 copies of the game were ever produced, and since then the game has only been available on online auction sites for premium prices.  That\u2019s the reason for this kickstarter project.  Tammany Hall is one of my favorite games and I want to make sure it gets into as many player\u2019s hands as possible.  I\u2019ve teamed up with Stratamax Games to make sure this game gets the wide release it deserves.\nThe game was designed by Doug Eckhart and developed by the talented team at Stratamax Games, with artwork by the exceedingly talented Peter Dennis (artist on games such as Brass, London, A few Acres of Snow and many, many more)\n\nTammany Hall. Take Power. Rule New York.\nTammany Hall is coming to kickstarter simply because it\u2019s the only way the game is ever going to get a wide release.  Despite great word of mouth, reviews and buzz in the board game community, Tammany Hall has never gotten a wide release.  In fact, only 500 copies were ever printed and most of those were sold in Europe at Essen 2010. \nThe kickstarter is going to help us raise money for the printing, shipping and distribution costs of Tammany Hall.  Without your support this game will continue to be relegated to \u201choly grail\u201d status.  One of those board games everyone hears about but very few get the chance to play. \nOn top of helping us bring this great game to players everywhere, you'll be able to get a copy of the game at a 10% retail discount, all stretch goal rewards and free shipping to the US for every donation level (other than the 1 dollar pledge).\nWe want to reward our supporters who help make this game a reality with stretch goals as the games funding improves.  Higher funding levels will allow us to make this already great game even better for our kickstarter backers.  Every pledge level will recieve all stretch goal rewards!\n45K stretch goal reward level\nAll backers will receive custom decal sheets for the political favor chips matching the flag of the immigrant\u2019s home country.\n55K stretch goal reward level\nAll backers will receive custom city office license cards.  These are thick cardboard player aides that are given to the players to designate the office that they hold and to serve as a reminder of your office\u2019s power during play.\n65K stretch goal reward level\nAll backers will receive 10 custom \u201cBoss\u201d meeples (2 in each player color).  You can\u2019t expect to rule New York without a party boss can you?  These custom \u201cBoss\u201d meeples feature a stove pipe hat and are used as your scoring marker and elected officials. \n80K stretch goal reward level\nAll backers will receive 90 custom \u201cstreet Gang\u201d meeples (18 in each player color).  What better way to get the vote out than a little voter intimidation?  These custom \u201cstreet gang\u201d meeples feature bowler hats and are used as each players ward bosses to help lock down wards.\n100K stretch goal reward level\nThe existing draw bag in the game is a plain white piece of cloth that the immigrant cubes are drawn from. It\u2019s functional, but it\u2019s not the most visually appealing or thematic element in the game. We are going to be upgrading the bag to a black velvet-like material, with a gold-colored draw string, and are going to silk screen a full-color Tammany Hall Logo on the bag.\nThe immigrant population was the power base of the Tammany Hall machine. Entire books have been written about the relationship between Tammany and the \u2018support\u2019 they provided immigrants (in exchange of course, for their votes). It was this abuse of trust that built the Tammany Empire and lined their leader\u2019s pockets with money. So, what better way to represent this thematically than by drawing the immigrant groups from a draw bag evocative of a coin purse?\n115K stretch goal reward level\nAt the 115,000 dollar reward level, we will be hiring an artist to do a little bit of touch up work to the board art.  The board artwork is amazing, but has a couple of issues that people have complained about. \nWe will be adding pencil thin black lines between the wards to make it clearer where one ward begins and the others end, and we will be upgrading the Tammany Hall artwork in ward 14.  The artwork itself is on a plain white background, we will be changing this to resemble a brass plaque complete with rivets in the corners to give it a more distinct look that fits with the rest of the game.\nNote: Due to shipping costs, this stretch goal will not be available in the $20.00 \u201cupgrade kit\u201d pledge level.\nA note on custom Meeples\nThere has been some concern expressed in the potential difficulty in distinguishing between the two types of custom meeples. The \u201cboss\u201d and \u201cstreet gang\u201d meeples are a purely aesthetic difference and have no bearing on the gameplay at all. The 2nd edition has a single type of player marker. The \u201cBoss\u201d meeples are used for scoring marker and city office for purely thematic reasons and not for gameplay reasons at all. From a gameplay perspective the pieces are completely interchangeable.\nWe have had some backers ask us about getting additional copies of some of our custom components in the game, so we are making these available for an additional pledge.  None of these are required for gameplay, but may give the game a little extra coolness that certain players want.\nTo request one of these additional levels simply add the dollar amount of the add-on to your pledge, but leave your reward level the same.  For example, if you wanted an additional set of decals and \u201cstreet gang\u201d meeples you would pledge a total of 70 dollars and select the 55 dollar reward level.  At the end of the campaign we will send out a survey and ask you what extra goodies you wanted for your pledge.\nNote: If you want multiple copies of any of these rewards, you can pledge for them twice, and during the survey you can note that you wanted multiple copies of a reward.  For instance, if you wanted two additional sets of \u201cstreet gang\u201d meeples you would pledge 75 dollars and select the 55 dollar reward level (for a single copy of the game).\nAdditional Custom Decals\nFor an additional pledge of 5 dollars you will receive a 2nd set of the custom decals for the political favor chips.  This will give you enough decals to cover both sides of the favor chips.  That way you can see the flag of the immigrant\u2019s home country no matter which side of the chip is up.\nAdditional \u201cBoss\u201d Meeples\nFor an additional 7 dollar pledge you will receive an additional 20 \u201cboss\u201d meeples (4 per player color).  This will bring your total number of boss meeples up to 6 per player (30 in total).  This is enough boss meeples to use as immigrant leader markers.  Currently the boss meeples are designed to serve as your scoring marker and to show which city office you hold.  This additional pledge allows you to use boss meeples to show the immigrant leaders and leaves your \u201cstreet gang\u201d meeples to be used only in the wards and not anywhere else.\nAdditional \u201cStreet Gang\u201d Meeples\nFor a pledge of 10 dollars extra you will receive a set of 50 street gang meeples (10 in each player color).  This doesn\u2019t serve any game function unless you want players to have extra meeples or want to use the meeples for another game.\nAre you one of the lucky few to already own a copy of Tammany Hall?\nWe want to make sure all of the fans of the game have access to the custom components being offered as \u201cstretch\u201d rewards in this campaign.  We hope you\u2019ll pledge for a new 3rd edition printing of the game, but we have added a new pledge reward for existing owners to get a copy of all stretch rewards that have been unlocked. \nNote: If you would like to upgrade your existing 2nd edition copy of the game and receive a new 3rd edition printing, simply add 20 dollars to the reward level you chose.  At the end of the campaign a survey will be sent out and you can select the \"upgrade kit\" as an additional option for your pledge.  For example, you can pledge 75 dollars and select the 55 dollar reward level to receive a copy of the 3rd edition and an upgrade kit for your existing copy.\nBelow is just a sample of the great critical praise the game has received:\nUndead Viking - 2D6.org\n\"I really really love the game. Enjoy the heck out of playing it.\"\n\"Once the game clicks for you then the game can open itself up to you. The story of the game starts telling itself to you. That\u2019s when this game is amazing.

If I had played [Tammany Hall] prior to Dominant Species, I would have said Chad Jensen tried to make a game like Tammany Hall. \"\n\"I think it\u2019s a fantastically fun game of matching wits with your friends.\"\nThe Dice Tower\n\u201cI loved it so much [...] I bought it right from the designer\u201d\n\u201cworthy of the biggest companies out there.\u201d\n\nGiant Fire Breathing Robot\n\"Tammany Hall is one of the most mechanically brilliant games that I\u2019ve played where deep strategy springs from a small choice set. But, beyond that, the game is just fun. It\u2019s a great area majority/control game that provides just the right level of both indirect (through immigrants) and direct (through placement and slander) competition. Tammany Hall is one of just a few games that I am always eager to play.\"\n\nCartrunk Entertainment\n\"Tammany Hall is a rare gem. I\u2019m hoping I get to play it again. It really is just the type of game I like. It has a finite turn structure and is based primarily on choice and player action. There is very little randomness about the game. You\u2019re not playing a system, you\u2019re not playing the cards, you are playing each other. That\u2019s a game to me. Give me a battlefield over which to match wits with my opponents.

Perhaps best of all, it\u2019s the most thematically consistent Euro-wood-cube game I\u2019ve ever played.\u201d \u2013 John Sizemore\nAs you can see Tammany Hall is a well regarded game, but you don't have to take our word for it.  You can check out the final version of the rulebook on Board Game Geek, watch a BGG walkthrough From Essen 2010 and can check the game out with online play.\nThe online play is available from Sloth Ninja Games.  And while we aren't affiliated with them, they are extremely awesome guys so while checking out the online version of Tammany Hall you should definitely check out the other games they have available!\nTammany Hall Rulebook on Board Game Geek\nTammany Hall Designer Diary on Board Game Geek\nOnline Play on Slothninja Games\nTammany Hall overview with Stratamax and Derk from BGG at Essen 2010.\nOne of the (many) things Tammany Hall is praised for is the great artwork and component quality of the 2nd edition.  While it may be a lofty goal, Pandasaurus Games is going to do it one better, and not just with the stretch goal rewards. \nWe are going to make sure this is a world class game worthy of your library.  Every component will be printed on thick 2.5mm cardboard with linen embossing.  The board, the box, the custom components, all of it.  We are going to be using a major printer who handles games for some very big name publishers.  It might cost more to do it this way, but we want this to be a game you are proud to have on your shelf.\nPrior to printing the game we will be given component mock ups of the final printing and will inspect them for any problems before the printer begins the full print run.\nThis is a game that we love.  We are going to make sure it's the best the game has ever looked.  We owe it to the designers, the game and most of all our backers.\nPandasaurus Games is a start-up independent publisher of hobby board and card games based in Austin, TX.  Our goal is to help great games make it to gamers tables.  We believe board games are a great way to get together with friends and family and foster a sense of community that many forms of entertainment stifle.  \nWe're just a couple of gamers that want to bring fun games to the world.\nPandasaurus Games is pretty easy to get a hold of online.  We're always on BGG when we should probably be working, and can be reached on our homepage, twitter and facebook. \nhttp://www.pandasaurusgames.com\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30645/tammany-hall\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/Pandasaurusgame\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pandasaurusgames", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #56", "update_userinfo": "Checking Back in with the people who helped make Pandasaurus what we are!", "update_content": "We wanted to take a moment to thank you all again for helping to making this company possible and let you know where we are as a company since you are all a huge part of Team Pandasaurus!

So it looks like we'll have to \"scale back\" the film & instead tell the story of this bird house.\nMy name is Jeff Toste and I am a lifelong Rhode Islander. One of my first memories of coming to \"the capital city\" of Providence was when I was little and visiting Haven Brothers diner with my father. I remember walking past a gang of bikers and climbing into what looked to me like a silver space ship. The bikers are gone now, but the space ship remains.\nHaven Brothers Diner is like greasy space ship traveling through time. For over 100 years it has survived the Great Depression, world wars, and changes in culture and diet. However, few know its long--and at times--even controversial history.\nInstead, people know its food--food most often eaten in the early hours of the morning. Haven Brothers: Legacy of the American Diner tells the tale of this diner icon. Born in the birthplace of the American diner, Providence, RI, Haven Bros. is the oldest operating diner still on wheels--as were all the diners of its day.\nI feel privileged that I get to tell the story of this unique place and I want to do it justice. However, I can't do that, and finish the film in a reasonable time frame, without raising additional money. I've already invested a great deal of my own time and funds into the film since November of 2010--in between paying work.\nMany friends also continue to donate their time and energy into the film, but they can only do so much. Therefore, I'm asking for your help to finish the documentary.\nRights to historic images; renting of additional video and audio equipment; editing; sound design and mixing; color correction; marketing costs; and festival entry and related costs: these are the bulk of the expenses we hope to cover with your help.\nAs you may know, it's all or nothing with KickStarter.

New goals on the horizon!\nUpdate #1: Answers to questions - Do you have a publisher? How big is Crate? How far along is Grim Dawn?\nGrim Dawn is old-school style, open-world action role-playing!\nGrim Dawn is an action role-playing game being created with the tools and technology used to build Titan Quest by a few veteran developers from Iron Lore, including Arthur Bruno, the lead gameplay designer on Titan Quest.\nWe\u2019re a small team with limited resources and we\u2019re not competing to launch the next big ARPG but if you\u2019re a more traditional gamer that still craves the complexity, intrigue and quirkiness of older games, maybe Grim Dawn can be the next big ARPG for you.\nGrim Dawn won\u2019t hold your hand to ensure you never make a bad decision and it won\u2019t feature a story on rails with linear level design to prevent you from ever getting lost.  It will, however, offer you the chance to do things in your own way, have an experience that is unique from everyone else playing the game and explore off the beaten path to see and do things that not every player is likely to find.\nUnlike many other ARPGs, in Grim Dawn,  you\u2019re not the lone hero out on a quest to save the world by vanquishing one ultimate evil.  The world of Cairn, in which Grim Dawn is set, has been devastated by a war between two otherworldly powers, with humankind caught in the middle.  The dangers facing the survivors of humanity are too great and numerous to be solved by any one individual.\nThere is still beauty in the world but it is permeated with darkness and peril.  The broken remnants of wraith-like Aetherial and demonic Ch\u2019thonian armies rove the lands seeking to gain some advantage in a cataclysmic war that's ground to stalemate.  Bands of human marauders turned cannibal roam the roads and creatures from the days of lore, thought driven to extinction, find the world ripe for their resurgence.\nIt is the dawn of a desperate and dangerous new era in Cairn where isolated enclaves of human survivors struggle to rebuild and many are in need of help.  This is the backdrop for the countless adventures that await you in Grim Dawn.  There is no one central story; there are many stories and whether you help the weak or help yourself and how you go about it is yours to decide.  It pays to have some allies in troubled times like these but choose them carefully\u2026\nCore features\nWe\u2019ve listened to years of feedback from the Titan Quest community and continue to do so every day on the Grim Dawn forums as we strive to improve upon past performance and make this our greatest work yet.  The creation of Grim Dawn is guided by traditional design and old school sensibilities, with innovation only in the areas where we feel it truly improves the game and isn't just a gimmicky back of the box feature.\nGrim Dawn will:\nBe DRM free!\nInclude robust modding tools so you can create your own worlds!\nBe faster-paced, with much more satisfying enemy hit reactions and deaths.\nAllow you to fight house-to-house as you lay waste to enemies and the former owner\u2019s furniture in the process.  Break through walls to open up new areas of exploration!\nFeature a more open-world design with randomized elements that will greatly enhance replay-ability.  Each play-through will be unique with \"set-piece\" spawners that can turn a patch of wilderness into different types of enemy camps, a traveling merchant caravan, etc, each with their own unique art.\nWe don\u2019t control where you go; you do!  If you don't want to follow the main story, you aren't forced to.  Non-linear progression allows you to unlock new areas by repairing bridges, defeating enemy blockades, etc, as soon as you have the resources and power to do it.  Race ahead into higher-level areas and get pwned, we'll warn you but we're not going to stop you!\nLet you combine any two of five distinct skill classes, each with multiple skill trees in which to specialize.  Spend money to reclaim skill points if you\u2019re unhappy with your build.\nHave a refined loot system that drops far less junk-items, produces more uber randomized gear and ensures more consistent rewards from hero and boss monsters.\nImmerse you in a gritty, dangerous, Victorian era fantasy world where humankind has been pushed to the brink of extinction by warring otherworldly powers. \nGive players meaningful quest choices and the ability to visually change the starting town as they help to rebuild and secure the future survival of humanity.\nLet you ally with NPC factions to earn rewards and unlock new quest lines.  Be wary though, aiding one group can make another your enemy!\nJoin up with friends in coop-multiplayer through online match-making or play over LAN and experience the full game together.\nAnd so much more\u2026\nWhat else makes Grim Dawn different?\nAt its core, Grim Dawn strives to perfect the magical formula of fast-paced, satisfying combat, strategic character development and frenzied loot collection that defines the genre.  However, we don't know of too many (or any?) ARPGs that let you make meaningful quest decisions and allow you to earn favor or go to war with different NPC factions.  Have you ever been able to repair bridges to unlock new areas in whatever order you choose?  With so many stylized ARPGs coming out now, we think our gritty art style and realistic world also help to define us.  Speaking of realistic world, did we mention that the levels in Grim Dawn are actually stitched together to form a giant, continuous playable world, reflective of natural geography?\nThese are some of the features that help to set Grim Dawn apart.  With your contribution, who knows how far we can go!\nSound overly ambitious? \nIt might be... if it weren't for the fact that these features already exist!  Well hey, we're not just some dudes rolling up in here, looking for you guys to take all the risk in funding our dream gig.  We've already put a lot of our own blood, sweat and tears into this labor of love over the past 2+ years to get it where it is today.  We've developed a ton of cool new features and the core gameplay is already quite fun, if we do say so ourselves.  What?  You want to see the gameplay?  Well, here is our latest sampling! (hopefully just enough to get you hooked...)\nWhy do we need your help?\nThough we have several experienced developers working on Grim Dawn, only two of us are in a financial situation where we can afford to support ourselves without a salary (albeit on a steady diet of bread and moldy cheeses).  The other guys involved with Grim Dawn work day jobs at other game studios to pay the bills and contribute as they can on nights and weekends.  As you might imagine, this makes for pretty slow going and it is certainly not ideal for creative collaboration.  When critical team members end up in crunch at their day jobs, they can sometimes get tied up for weeks, causing certain aspects of our development to temporarily grind to a halt. \nOccasionally, just to get things in-game, we have people performing jobs that are really outside their area of expertise.  This can result in such things as \"1990s looking\", designer-created UI and programmer-drawn lightning bolts.  Even so, some aspects of development, such as art, animation, and world-building, are falling woefully behind the programming and gameplay development.  We're at a point now where we have solid core gameplay and some robust features but not enough content to release anything and we really need to accelerate that process. \nWhile we could still finish a fine little game on our own, that would be rough around the edges but very fun, we believe there is a much greater potential that could be realized if we were more adequately funded and staffed.  So we're hoping you can help give us some proper funding so that we can get the team together, start making faster progress and ultimately release a bigger, better game for you and everyone else.\nIf you'd like to see more information about our current state of progress, check out this recent \"State of the Game Address\" on our forum.\nWhy should you care?\nBecause we care!  Yeah, yeah, we know, you probably hear that a lot nowadays.  Suddenly everyone is denouncing publishers and talking about how they want to make games for traditional gamers... as long as you provide the funding first.\nHow are we different?\nWe also set out to make a game we were passionate about, guided by old school design sensibilities, for traditional gamers.  The difference is that we started Grim Dawn over two years ago with no funding except for our personal savings. \nI'm Arthur Bruno and at my last job, as Lead Designer at Iron Lore, I made a pretty comfortable salary with great benefits.  Now I make zero thousand dollars a year with no benefits (well, there are definitely some benefits but health insurance isn't one of them).  I'm not complaining though, it has been totally worth it though to be able to pursue a dream and work on a game I love, for fantastic fans that have supported us from the beginning.  It hasn't been easy but I wouldn't have it any other way... well, I mean, if you guys funded this project, that would certainly make things easier and I'm down with that.  In thirty some-odd days though, regardless of whether we reach our funding goal or not, I'll still be working on Grim Dawn, trying to make it happen.\nNot only are we dedicated to creating this game but we're dedicated to our fans.  We don't need to promise that we're going to start a new, open dialog with fans and seek your input on development because we already are.  I personally have over 650 posts to the titanquest.net fan-site forum and over 1800 on the Grim Dawn forums.  That's an average of over 2 posts a day since the forum went live more than two years ago.  We've put up polls to get consensus from forum members when we are on the fence about an issue and we've asked for feedback on everything from place names to class skills, to UI.  We've even implemented a few features based on suggestions from the forum.\nHere are just a few links to threads that serve as examples of the type of collaborative interactions that take place on our forums:\nMain menu development discussion\nMastery names and description discussion\nHUD UI modification discussion\nAnother proof of our dedication to fans is that we don't hold back game information in order to arrange exclusives with the gaming press.  We release information and updates directly to the Grim Dawn forums, our Facebook page and...  well, actually that's usually it.  When stuff appears in the press about Grim Dawn, it usually comes from our website.  Fans always see everything first!  We've always had a very open, honest and personal dialog with our fans.\nFinally, we have a long-standing passion and commitment to making this a hardcore ARPG for PC, guided by the best of old school design principles.  The game as it stands today, is the same game we told fans that we were setting out to make in 2009 and the feature set reflects that. Whether we get funding or not, that isn't going to change; it's only going to get better.  Want to know more about my philosophies as a designer?  Check out these posts, one of which is pasted from an interview I did for Rock, Paper, Shotgun.  \nRock Paper Shotgun Interview - Old School Design\nDesign philosophies - The profit and loss of playing games\nHow will the Kickstarter money be used?\nThe first thing we should stress is that our funding goal is not the budget to make this game; only to help finish it.  There is no way you could make Grim Dawn from scratch with its current level of quality and feature set on such a small budget.  It is only because we've acquired the rights to a pre-existing engine built for ARPG and invested some of our own money and years of unpaid work into this project that we're at a point now where a few hundred thousand dollars can make a big impact.\nOur goal is about the minimal level of funding that would be required to make a big difference on this project because it is enough where we can start to bring on some of our part-time people, full-time and guarantee them at least a certain duration of wages.  This would likely be an animator, artist and designer to start out.  We'd also use money for more outsourcing so that we could get additional unique item art and enemy models.\nJust having a few full-time people in these critical roles would be a world of difference for the project.  Not only would we be able to get so much more done and produce better work but we'd also have more time to post updates and interact with the community.  We'd be able to reach alpha release a little faster but as the extra help had time to work, content would start to flow much faster, leading to a speedier beta and final release, as well as a lot more frequent updates along the way.  It would still be a lot of work with such a small team but we'd be progressing at more than triple the rate that we are currently.\nIf we exceed our goal, all of the extra money will be used to bring more full-time people onto Grim Dawn and expand our art outsourcing.  That means more content, more quickly.  The ultimate goal would be for us to bring all of our part-time people on full-time and hopefully even hire a few more people.  Then we would be totally rocking and well on our way to making Grim Dawn all that it can be!\nThank you for helping us make this happen!\nThe Crate Team\nPlease note that reward delivery estimates are conservative.  We think we can deliver many of them earlier, especially if we exceed our funding goal but we want to try to play it safe.  Also, note that the delivery estimates are based on whatever item will take the longest to produce in any tier.  Since we're not sure whether we'll be able to finish the Crate story and get it sent out during development of the game, we've allowed some time post-release.  In a best case scenario though, we'll be able to deliver much of this stuff earlier.\nExisting Grim Dawn Key-Holders - Please Read!\nTo ensure that you get the reward that you desire and are properly credited, you must carefully read and follow the instructions posted in the Official Kickstarter Project thread on the forum.

You play the game with a bluetooth magic wand and your iPhone or Android smartphone.\nWe posted quite a few updates to this project. If you're new here, you might want to read these updates first:\nThe Wand is Hackable! Want to use your wand to control lighting, sounds, special effects or your home stereo? Well now you can.  Check out update #7 for details.\nWant to know more about gameplay? Check out update #4 for details.\nRead on to learn more...\nWe\u2019ve always wanted magic to be real.  From casting spells, to magical battles and quests, we want a real magic wand that works in the real world.  And while we\u2019re asking for wish fulfillment, let\u2019s add in the depth of a big fantasy online game and the strategy of a cool Trading Card Game.\nAnd that\u2019s what Incantor will deliver.  A game with a Bluetooth magic wand \u2013 paired with your smartphone \u2013 that casts spells based on the gestures you make.\nIn the game you can cast spells, run quests, or have battles that involve you and all of your friends!  \nLearn the art of spell casting. Play against other Incantors and virtual beasts.  Gather with your friends and pursue magical quests to find lore, power and valuable items.  Combine the physical and virtual to create a truly unique gaming experience. \nThat's Incantor.  And that\u2019s what you become part of if you back us on Kickstarter. \nIncantor isn't just a wand and a special app on your phone, but a community of gamers. You'll be able to establish an identity, form groups, and learn and practice skills that give you the potential to make your Incantor wand different from any other wand on the planet!\nInterested in learning more about the lore that backs the Incantor universe? Visit our blog where we will be posting new art, concepts and lore constantly! We're into fantasy just as much as you are so we love creating this stuff!\nThe wand is filled with enough technical goodness to make magic real! Every wand is: \nA sophisticated motion control device, with haptic feedback, that is paired to your smartphone.\nA game controller that can lock onto intended targets, read your spell shaping and cast your spells.\nA weapon of magical martial arts that takes training and skill to master.\nA high quality collectible object that is personalizable expression of who and what you are and how you've developed it!\nThe wand holds and controls your magical powers. You become an Incantor by choosing your wand. This sets your class in the game and creates a pairing with an Incantor in one of the other five magic realms. As you play the game, you'll have the opportunity to learn more spells, and develop your wand. \nYou can own multiple wands to use at different times just like leveling up multiple characters in your favorite MMOG. Some wands are healer wands, some are damage dealers, others are stealth magic and so on. All wands can do battle, quest and level up.\nYour wand is paired by Bluetooth to your smartphone. You can now cast and receive spells, target opponents, find and reveal hidden magical items and kick all sorts of magical butt in the real world! Through your smartphone, we know where and when all Incantors are using their wands and all the specifics about your level, what spells you\u2019ve chosen and if you are forming them correctly when you cast (yes it takes practice and skill! Did you think being an Incantor was easy?). \nThere are multiple UI modes to manage your spells, track your friends, enemies, events and items, and manage your strategies in all gaming modes.\nPrototype for Spell Management Display\nPrototype for Real-time Battlefield Heads Up Display \nSome of the other things that make Incantor unique:\nThere are thirteen different modes of play are in development with more to come. Those modes of play include various forms of questing, battling and training for single players or whole teams of Incantors. \nWe are planning gatherings, events, leagues and more after launch and we will be tracking your stats on the local, regional, national and international level.\nWe will launch with one-on-one sparring/dueling and several modes of questing. Additional modes of gameplay will be added rapidly after launch.\nFinally, Incantor is fundamentally a social game. Though there are many ways to play on an individual basis, it really kicks into high fantasy gear when you and your friends come together. A magical team/guild is called a \u201cBinding.\u201d A Binding can be as few as two Incantors but can also grow to dozens. Strategy on the field of quest and battle is rich and nuanced when a binding learns to employ different classes of Incantors and combinations of spells and items to achieve their goals and move up in the levels and stats.\nFor five thousand years the battle between the five great realms of magic has been silent. \nA sorcerous ward of unimaginable power, cast by the five greatest Incantors, sealed the reachings between realms and stopped the battles that threatened to destroy all.\nBut now the rumored sixth realm has been found: Earth... It is a realm bereft of magic and unbound by the great barrier!\nIf you build a wand that is an exact match of a wand owned by an Incantor from one of the five realms of magic, you will become that Incantor\u2019s apprentice. You will be able to channel their power through a \u201creaching\u201d between the realms!\nWith magic unleashed once more, old alliances across realms will be renewed... and ancient enemies will re-awaken to do battle through their apprentices on Earth.\nYour quest is to gain skill in your sorcerous art, find other Incantors and bind together amassing your power, knowledge, skills and artifacts.\nThe battle is upon you as the realms press closer, thinning and penetrating the veil that separates Earth from all manner of mystical wonders and threats.\nTo triumph, you must train hard. Learn the lore, gain spells, creatures and items from beyond our realm. Magic is your martial art and you are our only hope...\nA: It establishes a rich fantasy world within which you shape and grow yourself and your binding as Incantors. \nThe Lore delivers the key information you need to advance in the world of Incantor. New spells and where to find them. Historical strategies. How to defeat or capture different kinds of magical creatures and faedes. \nThe Lore itself is part of what is discoverable in the world of Incantor. There are places and times where the fabric between our world and the five realms thins. During those times items and information from the other realms can be found and pulled into our realm. Incantors who are good at finding and harvesting these bits of Lore will be very valuable to their bindings and will gain rewards for their skill at Lore.\nA: We believe that Kickstarter is the best opportunity for us to get connected with you, the gamers, the fans, the lovers of rich magical fantasy. We want you to work directly with us to influence the outcome of the final stages of the development process.  In short, to help us make the game better and make it for you! (The alternative is to have some investment bankers with one hand on the wheel...)\nFunding to the $100K level gets us to a first release! We've spent 18 months developing the technology, software, gameplay and narrative. Now that we have a working wand prototype, we are ready to move the first level of functionality into the hands of real gamers. This first release will support two or three modes of play for all ten classes of wands.  From there it\u2019s off to the magical races and growing our player base and all the additional content for the game itself!\nAny generous overfunding we get will be applied directly to building out more of the gaming modes, spells, player functionality, wand features, social support, events and publishing earlier.\n\nA: For those of you who help us by contributing, we are granting many different levels of lifelong benefits available only to our kickstarter supporters. Those benefits range in scope based on contribution level, but include:\nHonorary in-game titles and privileges that we will never offer again\nEarly lifelong access to new wand releases, upgrades, new designs and more\nRare Beta wands\nBeta-test participation\nThe newest wands for life\nCustom or one-of-a-kind spells you get to name\nOne of a kind wand\nCollectible, signed development art\nEarly access to Lore (believe me, it\u2019s an advantage)\nGame dev access and input\nVIP event status and much, much, more\nAnd the lifelong props that you were one of the first Incantors in the sixth realm!\nPlease check out all the goodies at each level of contribution.\nWe hope you will support bringing this new form of fantasy gaming to first launch and pass along the news about Incantor here on Kickstarter to your magically inclined friends, family and colleagues. \nA: Our management team has spent 35 years in entertainment and 42 in technology.

After 6 months of designing, prototyping and testing, I am proud to introduce the P1 by Premier Pen.\nWhat is Premier Pen?  It is a brand new pen company, started by yours truly.  I've got a long list of ideas for future pens (different materials, shapes, ink cartridges, etc.) and am hoping that this Kickstarter project is the first of many!\nThe idea for Premier Pen started in the summer of 2011 with one of the typical \u201cI could do that\u201d moments.  While reading the daily helping of tech blogs \u2013 I came across the \u2018Pen Type A\u2019 on TechCruch (link).  I quickly jumped to the Kickstarter page and ordered two.  It has a stunning design paired with an awesome ink cartridge and I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on them.\nI love the idea.  Fun loving people.  Beautiful design.  Seemed perfect for my desk.  Unfortunately, not for my pocket. And I travel. A lot.\nI always carry a pen with me (along with a moleskine journal) \u2013 for jotting down bursts of creative inspiration, thoughts about life and photography, as well as anything else that comes to mind (don\u2019t forget to buy milk).  However, the Pen Type A wasn\u2019t going to fit the bill.  So, I figured I\u2019d build the pen that was perfect for me.\nEarly design sketches\nEarly prototypes\nThe end result of 6 months of designing, prototyping and testing is the P1.  I think the weight is perfect, it feels nice in your hand and it brings some of the joy back to writing. \nPlus, by basing it around a very affordable and flexible pen cartridge (30+ colors, 4 widths) - you can customize it to your liking.\nThanks for your support!\nWant even more background, check out www.premierpen.com & http://premierpen.com/our-story\nSize info\nLength: 138mm (with caps on)\nDiameter: 9.5mm \nWeight: 17.2 grams (including ink)\nReward photos:\n\nP1 Raw: Body, rounded front cap, screw back, allen wrench and black ink cartridge.

Two to four players start in a basement/fallout shelter which can lead out to several base locations or even through the tunnels to sewer grates throughout the  transformable board. Their survivors are trying to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the walking dead.\nAs in any survival game one needs food, guns, ammo, and more. Players go out into the wasteland and scavenge for supplies, or perhaps to find a new gun or melee weapon to fend off the next zombie attack.\nIn addition to gathering supplies, each player forms and controls their own squad. Each squad works to fortify the base(s). However your walls and barbed wire won\u2019t hold the dead for long, and they\u2019re getting hungry.\nPlayer's receive victory points for killing zombies, building defenses, and successfully completing goals. Victory points show who is soldiering on the best in this wasteland. The final tally of points determines the winner.

You're thrown into a world where you have to work together with your fellow survivors or risk perishing to the overwhelming number of zombies.  It\u2019s a tense game of careful choices: \nDo you go for another weapon? \nDo you go Kamikaze on a group of zombies with just an axe? \nOr do you run the other way with your tail between your legs?\nThis myriad of choices adds to the fun of the game, and leads us into our next segment, Re-playability.\n\nZpocalypse, by design is a highly modular format game. The tiles used, as the game board, allow them to be placed in nearly any orientation, with the ability to have expansion tiles added in later on down the road. This adds for a much varied landscape and new experience every play through. This modular style of play has been so successful, that we have found many people who kept coming back to play more and more Zpocalypse. \nAt several conventions we would have people come back the next day, or even later in a same day, to play another round.  What shocked us was, at a recent game demo day at a local board game store, we had two repeat players who brought friends to show the game. \nSo far nearly everyone who has played our game has had an enjoyable experience and a desire to play again and again!\nClick Here for larger view of Components\nNote: This is a prototype shot, thus miniatures shown with tokens\n20 board tiles\n80 build tokens\n120 standard cards\n20 non-standard goal cards\n1 point tracker\n12 dice (8 red, 4 blue)\n20 page rule booklet\n30 zombie miniatures (10 singles, 20 doubles) - Prototype tokens shown!\n4 squad sheets\n4 squad miniatures (male & female, back to back) with unique base colors\n4 colored point tracker tokens\nEnlarge rules example\nWe have spent untold hours refining, editing, adding, removing, and tweaking our rule booklet to make it as approachable and understandable as possible.\nAnd even if you're unclear about a certain aspect of game play, we will be including Quick Response (QR) codes on each page section, that you can easily scan with your smart phone,  that will link to tutorial videos on that particular topic.\nWe would like to produce Zpocalypse with the best miniatures humanly possible.

Check the update tab for more info!\nUPDATE 1:  Proud to announce we're going to be developing for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android!  In addition to Steam codes, we will also be offering DRM free versions.  And for all our lovely friends overseas, we'll be localizing the text in French, Italian, German, and Spanish.  Thanks for the support!\nWoooooooooOOOOoooOoOoooOOooo!\nWe did it! 100% funded in just over eight hours. You people are amazing! But it's not over yet. The number keeps going up and now the question is just how much news do we want to make with this? We're getting a lot of attention already and it seems like this little project could have an impact beyond itself. \nAll money raised will go to make the game and documentary better. Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

Thanks for checking out our Quinn Popcorn Kickstarter page! \nIf you love microwave popcorn, but want ALL the chemicals taken out and replaced with natural ingredients and fun & unique flavors, you have come to the right place!  We even took everything out of the bag BUT the paper!  \nWith your support, we can get Quinn Popcorn out into market and on the shelves at a grocery store near you! \nThe money that we raise on Kickstarter will help pay for our ingredients and the materials that go into our first production run.  \nThis includes: \nOrganic corn kernels \nNon-gmo, expeller pressed oils \nPure Pop Bags (stripped of everything.- we use compostable paper)\nOrganic and all natural spices & herbs\nMaterial for our spice and oil pouches \nOur Quinn Popcorn boxes that are 100% recyclable and made from recycled materials. \nWhy Quinn Popcorn? \nWe have had this idea for years. We are both addicted to popcorn, but all of the microwave popcorn that is currently out there lacks the flavor and natural ingredients we crave. It also contains a crazy amount of chemicals.  We wanted to eat a good and pure product. So, while waiting for something like this to appear on the shelves, and always being disappointed when it didn't, we realized we just needed to take a chance and jump in to see where it takes us.  This was 10 months ago. With 100% dedication and hard work, it's been non-stop since then! \nWith the support of our family, friends, vendors, suppliers, blog followers, and fellow food entrepreneurs, we are finally ready to get it out there...but we could use some help! This is where YOU come in! \n\nSo, you ask, \"What makes Quinn Popcorn so ridiculously amazing?\"  \nOur PURE POP BAG:  What's left when you strip the bag of all the chemicals, PFOAs, PFCS, and the susceptor? Paper, 100% compostable paper.  \nOur INGREDIENTS:  We are extremely picky when it comes to our ingredients.  We found the purist available.  No preservatives, no additives, no artificial anything.  With five ingredients or less, we get distinctively simple flavors, with real ingredients, real taste, AND we know exactly where they come from. \nOur FLAVORS:  It was a tough decision, but here they are!  \nParmesan & Rosemary:  Savory aged cheese with a hint of rosemary.\nIngredients: organic corn kernels, expeller pressed canola oil, rbgh-free cheese, organic rosemary, sea salt\nVermont Maple & Sea Salt:  Just the right amount of sweet & salty.\nIngredients: organic corn kernels, expeller pressed canola oil, maple sugar, grey sea salt\nLemon & Sea Salt: Understated,clean tasting, but buttery. (without using butter!)\nIngredients: organic corn kernels, expeller pressed grapeseed oil, dried meyer lemons, lemon powder* and sea salt \n*made from pure whole lemons! \nOne Box = 2 bags, 2 oil pouches, 2 spice pouches \nThe EXPERIENCE:  You have a hand in preparing your batch! Adding the oils and spices after popping allows us to use the best ingredients available. Plus, it wouldn't be as good without your help! \nAnd finally, a few photos:\nOur Pure-Pop Bags!\nWe tried hundreds of herbs, spices, salts, cheeses,oils and suppliers for before finding the right match.\nThat there? That's nothing but popcorn and paper. That's all we put in our bags!\nJust a few kernels freshly coated with Parmesan and rosemary.\nSo, it turns out that there is a lot that goes into getting a food product ready for sale. We blogged about it each step of the way and shard just about everything we learned. This is a shot of us working through the box design a few weeks ago. \nThe back of our box is probably a little overloaded with info, but there is so much to say!\nThank you for checking out our Kickstarter page!\nFollow us on our blog Quinn Popcorn \nLike us on Facebook\nFollow us on Twitter: @quinnpopcorn ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Hello Quinn Snacks Founders", "update_content": "Hello All,\nYou know what happens about once a week?
